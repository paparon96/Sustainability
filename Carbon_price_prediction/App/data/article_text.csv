Nonetheless, there was something special about the summit that just concluded in the Czech capital of Prague. For not only was this bigger - engaging 44 heads of state and governments representing all the European countries with the sole exception of Russia - but its purpose was grander: nothing less than the creation of a so-called European Political Community (EPC), a new framework to embrace an entire continent."
1066967569,20221011,"Iran cracks down on protests after Mahsa Amini's death in 'morality police' custody

Security forces in Iran cracked down Monday as protests and international criticism continued over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained for violating the country’s dress code.

Amini, who was Kurdish, was arrested last week by Iran's ""morality police"" for not properly covering her hair with a headscarf, or hijab, according to a statement from acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif. Amini collapsed at a detention center, fell into a coma and died three days later, the statement said.

Iranian police said Amini died of a heart attack and released footage purportedly showing the moment she collapsed. Her family told local media she had no history of heart trouble and said witnesses reported seeing her shoved into a police car.

Her father, Amjad Amini, told an Iranian news website that authorities pressured him to bury his daughter at night to reduce the chance of protests, but the family was able to bury her in the morning.

Thousands of protesters across the country took to the streets after Amini's death, including those in her home city, Saqez, where she was buried Saturday. Police arrested several demonstrators and used tear gas in Saqez and gunshots and water cannons to break up crowds in Iran's capital city, Tehran, according to videos shared on social media by Iranian journalists.

Women can be seen on video at the forefront of clashes with police taking off their headscarves. Wearing a hijab has been required for women since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Dozens of women also removed their headscarves in protest in 2017.

At least five people were killed, 75 were injured and several were arrested during protests Monday, according to the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a human rights watchdog that monitors the Kurdish areas in western Iran.

The U.N.'s Al-Nashif expressed alarm at Amini's death ""and the violent response by security forces to ensuing protests.""

“Mahsa Amini’s tragic death and allegations of torture and ill treatment must be promptly, impartially and effectively investigated by an independent competent authority, that ensures, in particular, that her family has access to justice and truth,” Al-Nashif said in a statement Tuesday. ""The authorities must stop targeting, harassing, and detaining women who do not abide by the hijab rules.""

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Amini “should be alive today.”

“Instead, the United States and the Iranian people mourn her. We call on the Iranian government to end its systemic persecution of women and to allow peaceful protest,” he said on Twitter.

Blinken's remarks came as the U.S. seeks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

Leaders of the European Union also issued a statement, saying Amini's death was ""unacceptable and the perpetrators of this killing must be held accountable.""

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian rejected the criticism and said on Twitter that Amini's death is being investigated by the judiciary and a parliamentary committees. Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi, who departed for New York on Monday to address the U.N. General Assembly, said he had told Amini’s family in a phone call that he has ordered an investigation and vowed to pursue the case.

“To Iran, human rights are of inherent value – unlike those who see it (as) a tool against adversaries,"" he said.

Police in Iran have expanded patrols in recent months and verbally and physically harassed women perceived to be wearing ""loose hijab,"" according to the statement from the United Nations.

The U.N. Human Rights Office said it has received numerous verified videos of women being slapped across the face, beaten with batons and thrown into police vans for not properly wearing the hijab. The office said there are reports Amini was hit on the head with a baton and her head was struck against a vehicle during her arrest.

Mehdi Forozesh, director of Iran’s Forensic Medical Organization, said on state television Saturday that the results of Amini's autopsy would be publicized after further review by medical experts, CNN reported.

Some nations do not report data on weekends. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't report data on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays with plans to go to weekly updates on Oct. 20.

The records were 3,846,048 cases on Jan. 21, during the height of the Omicron subvariant, and 16,849 deaths on Jan. 21, 2021, when the Delta subvariant was at its peak.

Few big countries reported increases in both categories in the past week, mainly in Europe.

European nations are experiencing case surges upon the arrival of cooler weather.

Despite a dramatic fall in testing, WHO data released Wednesday showed that cases in the European Union reached 1.5 million last week, up 8% from the previous week.

Hospitalizations also have spiked, including nearly 32% week in Italy with intensive care admissions up 21%, according to data compiled by independent scientific foundation Gimbe.

In Britain, which is not part of the European Union, they rose 45% in one week.

""There must be some complacency in that life seems to have gone back to normal - at least with regards Covid and people now have other financial and war-related worries,"" said Adam Finn, chairman of an expert group advising the WHO on vaccine preventable diseases in Europe, told CNN.

And Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London, also told CNN: ""Quite a high proportion of the population might have also had a Covid episode in recent months.""

British officials last week warned that renewed circulation of flu and a resurgence in Covid-19 further strain the National Health Service.

Experts warn this situation could hit the United States.

""In the past, what's happened in Europe often has been a harbinger for what's about to happen in the United States,"" says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told NPR. ""So I think the bottom line message for us in this country is: We have to be prepared for what they are beginning to see in Europe.""

But the situation may be different in Europe than the United States because of different levels of immunity and usceptibility to new subvariants they've not yet been exposed to.

""If it is mostly just behavioral changes and climate, we might be able to avoid similar upticks if there is broad uptake of the bivalent vaccine,"" Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina who helps run the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, told NPR. ""If it is immune escape across several variants with convergent evolution, the outlook for the U.S. may be more concerning.""

Without new restrictions in place, including social distancing and masks, people should stay at home if unwell, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, said in a report by The Guardian.

These numbers are surging despite Omicron variant-adapted vaccines available since September for elderly and compromised immune system.

Since Sept. 5, about 40 million vaccine doses produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been delivered to member states, according to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. But only between 1 million and 1.4 million were administered in the past month.

The European Union one-shot vaccination rate for the entire population is 76.1% with Britain at 69.6%,according to Bloomberg tracking.

In all, more than 12.7 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, a gain of less than 100 million in one week, with the world's population of 7.9 billion. Mainland China leads with 3.5 billion doses administered and a 92.4% one-shot vaccination rate among the 1.5 billion population, the most in the world. India is second with 2.2 billion among the 1.4 billion population and a 74.4% rate.

Japan, which has an 82.8% one-shot vaccination rate among all residents, plans to drop a ban on individual tourist visits and remove a 50,000 cap on daily arrivals. Those were the strongest restrictions among the Group of Seven nations.

Japan has 362 deaths per million, which is 145th in the nation, with the world at 841.7 and Peru No. 1 at 6,372. In cases, Japan's rate is 169,851 per million in 196th place with the world 80,382 and Austria the highest among large countries at 575,713 with, France 546,089, Portugal 543,080 and Denmark 534,108. Japan's population is 125 million.

Japan's seven-day moving case average is 26,785, the fewest since July with the record 255,534 seventh weeks ago.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in a speech last week it is ""in principle unnecessary to wear masks outdoors."" Indoors is only encouraged.

South Korea's situation, like Japan, is much better than a few months. Cases are at three-month lows with a seven-day moving average of 22,446. In late June it was around 7,000. The daily record was 621,328 on March 17.

China, where COVID-19 emerged more than 2.5 years ago, has reported 5,226 deaths. Before a spike in April, it was 4,636, which stayed at that number since early February 2021. On Sunday, China reported 503 cases with 5,659 on April 29. Those are confirmed cases with illness. Asymptomatic ones are reported separately in Mainland China.

In all, China reported 1,748 cases Sunday, more than triple the figure from the previous week.

""Over the National Day Golden Week holiday, China's overall Covid situation evidently deteriorated,"" Ting Lu, Nomura's chief China economist, wrote in a note.

In Beijing, the capita has tightened interprovincial travel to prevent residents from returning from their holidays.

Passengers traveling around China during this year's festival week was about 60% below that in 2019.

Zhangjiakou, a city in northwest China with around 4.6 million, hasn't reinstituted a citywide lockdown. But Zhang Ke, a Beijing resident who is not allowed to return home because he was near an outbreak, told the Financial Times: ""95% of the residential compounds are closed. Shopping malls and supermarkets are closed. No one is on the streets.""

Gulnazar, an Ili resident, whom The Washington Post is only identifying by one name because of security concerns, said: ""We've been locked up in our home for more than 40 days. We are short of everything, especially food,"" said Gulnazar, an Ili resident, whom The Washington Post is only identifying by one name because of security concerns. ""There are so many difficulties, I feel like crying just by mentioning them.""

The nation's top leaders convene in Beijing on Oct. 16.

Hong Kong, like China, has adopted a ""zero tolerance"" for coronavirus with strong restrictions eased, including hotel quarantine for arrivals from other nations.

Hong Kong reported three deaths and 4,890 cases Sunday with the record 79,876 on March 3.

The BA.5 Omicron strain has become the most dominant in the world, accounting for 81.3% of cases in the United States, according to the CDC projections through Sept. 30. The CDC didn't give a report update Saturday. The strain was first tracked in late April.

The CDC has classified 3.3% of counties, districts and territories with a ""high"" category level, compared with 22.9% ""medium"" and 73.7% ""low."" In ""high"" locations, masks are urged indoors.

The seven-day moving average for cases Thursday was 41,855, the lowest since 41,360 April 21, according to the CDC. And the deaths average Thursday fell to 345 two days after 334, the lowest since 318 on June 22.

New weekly hospitalizations in the United States for one week the previous Tuesday were 3,773, which is a 7.4% weekly drop. A total of 5,353,767 have been hospitalized with COVID-19 since its inception with a population of 332 million. The U.S. total reported Sunday was 25,759, which is 3.64% capacity, and far below the record 160,113 (20.6%) on Jan. 20, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

On Thursday in its weekly report, the CDC said the U.S. adult one-shot vaccination rate was 90.6% with completed primary service at 77.8% and one booster at 52.1%. The full population rates are 79.7% for one shot, 68% for two, 48.9% for three, 37.9% for four with only those 50 and older allowed to get the second booster.

The CDC says 5.3% of eligible people older than 12, around 11.5 million, have received the updated booster that targets Omicron after the rollout four weeks ago. Last week alone it was 3.9 milion.

NX Filtration, the global provider of breakthrough direct nanofiltration technology for pure and affordable water, announces its participation in the European innovation project LIFE PRISTINE, led by ACCIONA S.A. The project's objective is to eliminate emerging contaminants in the integral water cycle, one of the essential measures to promote alternative water resources in the face of water scarcity, which affects more than 2.8 billion people worldwide.

- The LIFE PRISTINE project has a budget of 4 million euros and is coordinated by ACCIONA, the Spanish sustainable infrastructure solutions group. Next to ACCIONA and NX Filtration, project partners include Eurecat, Xylem Services, the Regional Entity for Wastewater Sanitation and Treatment of the Murcia Region (ESAMUR) and the water utility provider Bilbao Bizkaia Water Consortium (CABB).

- The LIFE PRISTINE project combines water treatment processes, including NX Filtration's hollow fiber nanofiltration membranes, with artificial intelligence-based digital tools to develop a solution that removes emerging pollutants in the integrated water cycle. The integrated and versatile PRISTINE solution will be demonstrated in a representative full-scale operational environment.

Many forums have alerted on the urgent need to take steps to protect water resources, mainly through a reduction in water consumption but also by promoting alternative resources and reuse. These new resources are essential to guarantee water supplies for the future. One of the challenges to overcome fostering the reuse of water is the elimination of emerging pollutants and microplastics. These substances of anthropogenic origin are difficult to eliminate by using existing treatment systems and they may end up in seas and rivers, or even enter the food chain. Their presence may create hazards, which is why there is increasing emphasis on regulating the use of these substances and developing solutions to remove them from the environment.

LIFE PRISTINE is a sustainable alternative to ensure the elimination of emerging pollutants (+80%) in the end-to-end water cycle. It goes beyond the limits set by Directive 2020/2184/CE on Water for Human Consumption and the new European Regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse (Regulation (UE) 2020/741). LIFE PRISTINE focuses on emerging pollutants of the PFAS type (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances, used e.g. in flame retardants), pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal care products, toxins microplastics and genes of microorganisms that are resistant to antibiotics. The project will help to strengthen the existing legislation and promote the reuse of water with the highest quality and safety standards.

The PRISTINE solution involves processes of adsorption, nanofiltration and advanced oxidation using virtual sensors, process modelling and decision-making support tools. It will be capable of eliminating emerging pollutants efficiently (+80%, -30% OpEx) from water sources and wastewater effluent. The PRISTINE project will be demonstrated in a representative operating environment on a real scale: treating the secondary effluent of a treatment plant in Murcia and supporting drinking water pre-treatment in the Bilbao Bizkaia Advanced Water Treatment Centre (CATABB).

The LIFE21-ENV-ES-LIFE PRISTINE project (with project number 101074430) is funded by the European Union under the LIFE-2021-SAP-ENV call.

1066987399,20221004,"ASTANA. KAZINFORM Last week more than 80 faculty members of the Academy of Public Administration under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Gumilyov Eurasian National University learnt about the interactions between water, energy, food and environment security through the Nexus Simulation Game as part of the series of training sessions organized by the European Union funded project «Nexus Dialogue in Central Asia» together with the USAID Regional Water and Vulnerable Environment Activity.

The Nexus Simulation Game represents a facilitated process of playing five different scenarios for developing the territories upstream and downstream while addressing water needs of population, industry and agriculture and taking into account climate change challenges. It is a good training tool for policy makers to practice how different water management policies could facilitate sustainable development in harmony with the environment. Equipped with training materials and practical skills, the faculty members will pass newly acquired knowledge on to their students, the press and information team of the EU Delegation to Kazakhstan reports.

«Teaching the Nexus intersectoral approach in an interactive format helps to form a comprehensive understanding of the water-related challenges. All relevant sectors need be involved in finding the best solutions to tackle these challenges to develop our region in a sustainable way,» noted Raushan Dulambayeva, Professor at the Institute of Management of the Academy of Public Administration under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

«Ensuring water, food and energy security is at the top of today’s global development agenda. Nexus simulation is a great tool to learn to appreciate many interconnected challenges arising from the interactions between the water, energy, food sectors and ecosystems. It is valuable for training future specialists who will work in these key sectors to manage vital resources in the most efficient way to make our economy more resilient to climate change and revert environmental degradation,» stated Dana Akhmedyanova, Head of the International Relations Department of the Gumilyov Eurasian National University.

Addressing the participants of the Nexus simulation game, EU Ambassador Kestutis Jankauskas underlined: «This is EU investment into the friendship and cooperation with Kazakhstan and other Central Asian partners. EU needs partners to work together on combating climate change and other global challenges. We stand ready to share our best knowledge and technologies. The training is aimed at learn team-work, sharing and making compromises, seeing a bigger picture so we all could benefit together!» Ambassador thanked USAID, APA and CAREC partners.

It is expected that the Nexus Game will be incorporated in the curricular to complement the Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes at the Academy of Public Administration under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Gumilyov Eurasian National University.

Similar training sessions with more than 100 participants for a number of leading universities and civil service academies have been conducted by the EU funded project in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in 2022.

The EU-funded project «Nexus Dialogue in Central Asia» is implemented by the Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC). The project’s duration: June 2020 – May 2023; total budget: EUR 1.25 million with the EU’s contribution of EUR 1 million."
1066989128,20221011,"Apparel import of European Union (EU) from Vietnam shows upward trend in recent quarters as the bilateral trade boosted after the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). However, an analysis shows that EU’s apparel import from Vietnam could not breach the pre-FTA level. European Union and Vietnam signed FTA in mid-2019, and it came into effect from August 2020.

According to Fibre2Fashion’s market insight tool TexPro, EU imported garments worth $1.202 billion from Vietnam in Q2 this year, compared to the import of $1.215 billion in Q1. In Q4 2021 European countries imported garments valued at $0.974 billion, which was lower than import of $1.090 billion in Q3 2021.

The trend of import figures suggest that the trade remained quite volatile. Last two quarters noted impressive growth from the preceding quarters. The import breached a mark of $1 billion in Q3 2020, immediately after the first wave of COVID-19. However, the import value dipped to $0.574 billion in Q2 from $0.948 billion in Q1 2020, which increased to $1.128 billion in Q3, only to decline to $1.234 billion Q4 2020. EU’s garment import from Vietnam was valued at $1.132 billion in Q2 2021, and $1.170 billion in Q1 2021.

Apparel import of European Union (EU) from Vietnam shows upward trend in recent quarters as the bilateral trade boosted after the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). However, an analysis shows that EU's apparel import from Vietnam could not breach the pre-FTA level. European Union and Vietnam signed FTA in mid-2019, and it came into effect from August 2020.

Annual figures of EU import from Vietnam gives clearer picture. As per TexPro, imports were valued at $3.836 billion in 2021, $3.650 billion in 2020, $4.190 billion in 2019 and $4.081 billion in 2018. The annual figures suggest the bilateral trade could not breach even pre-FTA level. The FTA was signed on June 30, 2019 and was implemented from August 1, 2020. Therefore, the agreement came into effect immediately after the first global wave of COVID-19. The import had recorded steep fall in Q2, 2020 as economic activities halted due to the devastating pandemic."

1066992063,20221011,"For about six decades, oil exploration has been going on in the Niger Delta region. And it has brought spin-offs like gas flaring – which devastates the environment and health of people. JUSTICE NWAFOR travelled to Obrikom, the host of one of Nigeria’s biggest gas plants, where gas flaring has taken place for nearly three decades and documents how the residents live with the devastating impacts. This is the second of a three-part in-depth series exploring the impacts of oil exploration on the indigenous people of the Niger Delta.

Located 76 kilometres northwest of Port Harcourt – Nigeria’s largest oil city – in the Niger Delta region, is Obrikom community. Largely peaceful, it is inhabited by indigenous Ogba people who are predominantly farmers and fisherfolks and traders. With a total population of about 400,000, Ogba people hold in high esteem their cultural beliefs and practices like the annual community river cleansing (called Nchaka) and new-yam eating festivals, despite the influence of civilisation.

During the five-day Nchaka, the traditional rulers – who are the heads of their respective communities – and the eldest of women visit the rivers and perform rituals and chant incantations to drive away evil spirits, ill luck and illnesses from the community. The elderly women dress in traditional fabrics called Akwefe from the shoulder to the waist and hold burning firewood in their right hand.

Their houses, a mix of apartments and bungalows, wear rusted zinc roofs like torn royal hats. The streets, dotted with kiosks, are sandy with a mix of asphalted ones that look hurriedly constructed. There are a few haphazard drainage gutters, mostly half filled with sand. Beyond these, something really devastating is taking place in Obrikom – gas flaring. It is the burning of natural gas associated with oil extraction.

About one kilometre from 52-year-old petty trader Azubuike Osi ’s three-bedroom apartment is the Obiafu-Obrikom gas plant. It started operations in 1984 with an initial capacity of 270 million standard cubic feet (mmscf) of gas per day – equivalent to CO2 emissions from 1.67 billion gallons of gasoline consumed. It was upgraded to 400 mmscf/day in 1994, making it one of the largest in Nigeria.

In the gas plant are three gas flare stacks which tower above other structures in the community. Every minute, the stacks belch smoky methane-laden fire into the skies and generate consistently disturbing noise. This noise could be up to 86 decibels, a study by researchers at the federal university of technology, Minna, found. The temperature in the community averages 33 degrees celsius, especially in the dry (hot) season. A 2011 study published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science found that homes closer to gas flare stacks, like Osi’s, could experience temperatures four degrees Celsius higher than others.

From the operation, Nigeria Agip Oil Company (a subsidiary of Italian oil giant Eni) – which operates the plant – and the Nigerian government earn millions of dollars yearly while Obrikom residents, like Azubuike, are faced with health and environmental complications. For instance, in January and March this year, Nigeria sold gas worth $243.57 million for local consumption and export. The European Union Ambassador to Nigeria, Samuela Isopi, said in April that because of the Russia-Ukraine war, 40 per cent of the country’s gas is now being exported to the EU.

Gas flaring impacts the climate and environment negatively. Experts say it contributes to global warming by releasing CO2. Acid rain, which affects the productivity of soil for agriculture, is also caused by gas flaring. A study by researchers at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, found that rain in the Niger Delta region, especially in Rivers State where Obrikom is, is acidic due to gas flaring. It also has cascading impacts on human health.

In 2002, Azubuike got married to Faith. They had simple dreams: erect a house for the family in which every member would sleep peacefully at night, raise healthy children and live peacefully.

Four years later, they built the family house. Now, they have eight children but the noise and flame from the gas flare make life difficult for the family.

“We can hardly hear (because of the noise of the gas flare) and the heat (high temperature) is too much,” says Faith. “At night, sleeping is always difficult because of the discomfort. Most times when the burning gets more fierce, the noise and high temperature are unbearable. My children would roll endlessly on the bed.”

Faith says the constant flares have so affected her and her children that it is now unusual for a day to pass without any of her children crying to her because of intense headaches and itchy eyes. She’s only a petty trader and the constant need to purchase drugs like Anacin, Panadol, Tylenol and eye drops for the kids’ cuts really deep into her meagre purse.

According to data from the gas flare tracker of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) of Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Environment, from January 2013 to December 2021, the country flared 3.4 billion Million standard cubic feet (Mscf) valued at $12.0 billion. That resulted in CO2 emissions of 182.3 million tonnes, reveals data from the tracker.

Narrowing down to Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni local government area where Obrikom is located, within the same period, 129.3 million Mscf was flared resulting in the emission of 6.9 million tonnes of CO2.

Experts say residents of communities where gas flaring takes place stand higher risks of experiencing medical conditions like respiratory disorders and cancer, and children like Faith’s are not left out. A study by researchers at the Rivers State University of Science and Technology found the residents of Igwuruta, a community impacted by gas flaring like Obrikom, have a high frequency of medical conditions like eye and skin irritations.

A 2017 study also found that persons living in gas-flaring host communities in the Niger Delta are 1.75 times more likely to be hypertensive than persons resident in communities without oil and gas exploration activities.

Last year, Raimi Morufu Olalekan, who lectures on community medicine at the Niger Delta University, studied the quality of groundwater in Obrikom, comparing water quality parameters in the community with those of the recommended standards. The study found that the water in the community had magnesium, iron and heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, chromium, and nickel above the recommended levels. This means that residents of the community who drink water from boreholes drilled in the community are likely to experience medical conditions related to kidney malfunction, lung cancer, breathing problems, heart problems, asthma, nasal passage cancer and more, the report explained.

In July 2022 when Raimi spoke to the Nigerian Tribune about the study, he affirmed that the water remains unsuitable for drinking and that the inhabitants of Obrikom are vulnerable as a result of their prolonged exposure through persistent consumption of the water.

“Gas flaring, mineral dissolution/precipitation and anthropogenic input (like the release of waste) are the main sources of physicochemical indices (physical and chemical properties) and trace elements in the water,” he explained.

The air in Obrikom is not as safe as it should be. The constant belching of fire from the flare stack means the air in the community has been compromised and this puts the residents in great danger, Raimi says.

“Gas flaring has contributed to pollution build-up in our environment,” Raimi says. “It has increased the prevalence of particulate matter in the community. This is particularly dangerous for those who are asthmatic.”

Besides air pollution, noise pollution, as experienced by Faith and her family as well as other residents of Obrikom, Raimi says, has deep implications on the health and development of the residents, especially children. The United States Environmental Protection Agency says apart from tinnitus which is described as a ringing or buzzing sound in the ear (a symptom associated with many forms of hearing loss), repeated exposure to noise during critical periods of development may affect a child’s acquisition of speech, language, and language-related skills, such as reading and listening.

When Christian Nkisa retired from the Nigeria Police Force after 35 years of service, he hoped to spend the rest of his years in good health. Having spent most of the service years outside of his hometown, he thought it was the right time to go home to Obrikom – and he did.

“I served for 35 years and retired. During my service, I did not have problems with my eyes,” Nkisa, who is now the traditional ruler of Obrikom, told the Nigerian Tribune. After two years in the community, Nkisa said he started having problems with seeing clearly and constant eye itches.

When the problem started, Nkisa said he visited a hospital where he was told his condition is related to constant exposure to gas flaring in Obrikom. Now he spends a large part of the little money he makes from farming on routine medical checkups and medication.

“You can see how my eyes are now,” he said while dabbing tears from his bloodshot eyes with a soft white napkin. “In this community, almost everybody has an eye problem.”

The anger of Nkisa and other residents of the Obrikom is not just against Agip from whose facilities the gas flaring takes place but against the federal government of Nigeria, because part of the proceeds from the oil exploration in the community, which leads to the harmful practice, is what sustains the country economically.

“You can see the smoke coming from the gas flare site. There’s no other place it’s going other than sitting with the people. The federal government takes taxes from them (the company) while we suffer the implications.”

There are reports of Agip carrying out projects to improve facilities in the community, like the construction of an Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) centre. But Nkisa says the firm has not done enough. For instance, he raised an official complaint to the office of the president of Nigeria in 2019 about hazards from the firm’s activities. After the complaint, both parties were called for negotiations and the firm promised to construct “three internal roads in 2020 and 2021, respectively, and (carry out) the extension of electricity to where there is none,” Nkisa says. “In 2020, instead of three, they completed two. 2020 has gone, one road is left, 2021, we are now in 2022 and there is nothing.”

Folu Olapade, the spokesperson of Agip and Domenico Spina of Eni’s Reference Press Office, Upstream, were contacted for comments. Spina promised to get back with a statement but did not, eight weeks after Nigerian Tribune emailed questions and several follow-ups.

Beyond the health impacts, Lebari Sibe, an environmental chemist and climate expert at the University of Port Harcourt says there are intrinsic, chain-like implications on the climate, food security in the Niger Delta and increased methane emissions in the country. This is concerning given that methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere and over the past two centuries, its concentrations in the atmosphere have more than doubled.

He explained that continuous gas flaring contributes largely to the acidification of the rivers, and says this is the starting point of the chain. Due to poor access to drinking water, most residents drink from the exposed rivers.

“The residents are exposed to acidic water and the soil we use in agriculture is acidified and I can tell you that acidic soil does not support good soil fertility and it affects crop production, as well as the nutritional value of crops. This can be linked to the food crisis we are having in the country. Though not the only factor, gas flaring is one the factors contributing to the food crisis in the Niger Delta,” Sibe explains.

Nkisa, who lived in the community before he left to serve in the Nigerian Police, recalls with nostalgia what the situation was 35 years ago: “I was born here before oil exploration started. Then, one person could not carry the harvest from a few ridges of cassava because our crops did so well. But now, you can harvest your entire farmland without getting a significant quantity to take home because the soil has been affected (by recurrent gas flare).”

Nkisa’s complaint is an experience Faith knows so well: “Our cassava yield is usually poor and when we cultivate vegetables, the leaves turn yellow and eventually die off without much yield,” Faith says.

The same acid rain that falls on land, falls into the rivers and acidifies the rivers. This could lead to the death of fish and other seafood and affect the availability of protein to the Niger Delta people.

As a result, “we are forced to depend on meat from cows which is also a serious source of methane emission. When we are forced to rely on livestock like cows, we are forced to engage more in the farming of these livestock and the emission of methane, for example, from cow dung, will be higher and that increases the emission of methane generally. And that has very serious impacts on the climate.”

Sibe’s explanation is on point given that the GHG emissions from Nigeria’s agricultural sector hit 82MtCO2e in 2019, only behind Ethiopia’s in Sub-Saharan Africa – and more than the combined total CO2e emissions from Botswana, Namibia, Mauritania, Mauritius, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Eritrea, Central African Republic and Lesotho. The country ranks only behind South Africa on the list of top greenhouse gas emitters in Sub-Saharan Africa with 402 Million metric tonnes of Carbon Dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) emitted in 2019, according to Climate Watch – a platform the World Resources Institute designed to provide climate data. And the Nigerian government in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) says 60 per cent of the country’s greenhouse gas emission comes from the energy sector where gas flaring features prominently.

At the United Nations’ global climate talks in Glasgow last year (COP26), Nigeria pledged to attain net-zero emissions by 2060. In its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), it pledged to cut emissions 20 per cent by 2030 compared with business-as-usual levels. If the country receives international financial support, it could increase the cut to 47 per cent below business-as-usual by 2030, it says.

“The continuous exploration of oil and gas and environmental impact from the sector, disjointed regulations, improper execution, and lack of political will to implement some regulations” will make it difficult for the country to meet such targets,” Kingsley Ukhurebor, a lecturer at the Department of Physics at Edo State University, Nigeria, and Research Fellow at the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL), Burkina Faso, told Nigerian Tribune in June.

As dire as the implications are, gas flaring, which commenced alongside petroleum exploration in the Niger Delta in 1956, is not new to the residents of the region.

At sunset, hundreds of flare stacks light up the landscape of the region with over 30 million inhabitants. People who have lived all their lives here, like Emmanuel Omodu, the youth leader of Obrikom, feel helpless and see living with the hazard as a way of life which has been forced on them.

Omodu is not happy that the government and the oil companies do not care about the health implications of their activities on helpless residents like him and others in Obrikom.

“We live in the hazard. It is our world. When we cry, the government is only interested in what they are benefiting,” he says.

Nigeria is the number one gas flarer in Sub-Saharan Africa and has consistently been among the top seven flarers globally for the past decade, only behind Russia, Iraq, Iran, the United States, Algeria and Venezuela. Together, the World Bank says, these countries produce 40 per cent of the world’s oil each year, but account for roughly two-thirds of global gas flaring.

There have been several calls on the government to end the harmful practice over the years but none of the calls have compelled authorities to act decisively. The best it has done has been to announce new policies and dates to end the flaring but still, no concrete actions have been taken. For instance, Nigeria announced it would end the practice in 2009 but failed. Again, it set a 2012 target but missed it too.

Most recently, Nigeria Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP) was initiated with the aim to stop gas flaring in 2020. Again, the deadline was missed.

In fact, between 1969 and 2020, 10 deadlines to end gas flaring in the region were missed.

Chinazo Mbaonu, whose master’s dissertation at Teesside University, United Kingdom, focuses on emissions in West African countries, told Nigerian Tribune that though the government claims it has made progress in emissions reduction, the continuous flaring of methane in the country is primarily because the authorities “have not shown enough will to deal with the problem.”

Part of the NGFCP and other regulations in the past is that oil companies that flare gas would pay fines. But the fines – $2.0 per thousand standard cubic feet of gas flared by firms producing 10,000 barrels of oil or more per day and $0.50 per thousand standard cubic feet for firms producing less than 10,000 barrels of oil per day – are weak and not enough of a deterrent for the polluters.

“This boils down to the kind of regulations they are putting in place,” says Mbaonu. “The polluters are big guys with a lot of money and are ready to pay penalties if it’d be more profitable for them to continue flaring. So, the measures put in place are not enough to deter polluters. In fact, the fines should be so huge that it should scare them,” says Mbaonu.

Sibe agrees with Mbaonu. He says that the oil companies are still flaring gas because it is cheaper for them to flare than to spend money on facilities to capture and process it for sale, not minding the implications on the environment and people’s health.

“If we increase the carbon price (the cost applied to carbon pollution to encourage polluters to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit into the atmosphere), the polluters will retract,” Sibe says.

The Nigerian Tribune reached out to Mr Paul Osu, Head of Public Affairs of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission for comment on why NGFCP has been abandoned and why gas flaring still persists in the country. But he did not respond to any of the requests.

While Obrikom lacks good road connectivity despite Agip’s promises, it is surrounded by a network of high-pressure gas pipelines. When this reporter visited the community, within a few meters, Omodu pointed to 36-inch and 24-inch gas pressure lines underneath farmland and another 6-inch line (1.2 metres above the ground) on which locals hang washed clothes to dry. These lines are all a few steps away from residential buildings.

“Our land value has diminished (because) the community is crisscrossed by gas pipelines,” Omodu decries, asking “how will the community grow? Where will the community develop additional infrastructure? Can you build on top of a 24-inch gas pressure line?”

He fears that the hazards of gas flaring in the community and the numerous gas pressure lines may affect the generation of Ogba people after him. “If a fire or gas explosion happens in this community any time, we are finished. The explosion may not be in my lifetime; it could be in my children’s or grandchildren’s.”

Nigerian Tribune reached out to Eni seeking to learn how often they conduct maintenance checks, but the spokesperson did not respond.

Nigeria has an energy problem. According to the World Bank, about 80 million people living in the country – more than the number of people living in Australia, Rwanda, Belgium, Netherlands and Sweden combined – do not have access to electricity. Even those who have, experience sporadic supply and blighting cuts which last days and weeks.

So, a lot of them rely on small-size smoke-belching petrol and diesel generators. In fact, a 2019 report by Dalberg – a global strategy and policy advisory firm – says these generators are used in at least 11 million homes across the country, with a collective capacity eight times higher than that of the national grid. The national grid’s transmission wheeling capacity is 5,300 megawatts, according to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC).

About two-thirds of the power generation companies in Nigeria are gas-fired. However, their operations have been hampered by inadequate gas supply. The country has the ninth-largest proven natural gas reserve of over 192 trillion cubic feet. This means it has about 306 years of gas left (at current consumption levels and excluding unproven reserves).

Beyond the health and environmental hazards, stopping routine flaring of gas and converting it to usable forms can help Nigeria provide constant electricity to its citizens including residents of Obrikom who see light on gas flare stacks more often than on light bulbs.

After this reporter’s interview with Nkisa, he agreed to speak to the Nigerian Tribune on video the next day. But on that day, his eye problem worsened, such that he could not speak for minutes without serious discomfort.

“He cannot come out to see anybody today, his eyes have gone worse”, Nkisa’s wife Lolo, said. This is exactly why we are talking about the gas flare. You can see what it has caused.”

""We are also deeply saddened by the tragic loss of human life. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families,"" said the official.

Jose called, via his Twitter account, for ""a swift, independent and transparent investigation to bring all perpetrators to justice. We must continue to fight the criminal networks that exploit migrants and asylum-seekers in Libya.""

Reports varied about the incident; some eyewitnesses said the dead people were migrants caught in a dispute between two rival groups of people smugglers, while others declared an artillery shell that attacked the boat.

The Libyan Red Crescent Society, which led the rescue mission, did not reveal any details, saying its efforts are limited to providing humanitarian support to local authorities and alleviating the suffering of the most vulnerable groups.

The British Ambassador to Libya, Caroline Hurndall, called for an investigation into this ""abhorrent” incident and bringing the perpetrators to justice, adding that the criminal networks that exploit migrants and asylum-seekers must be dismantled.

The UN said that 11 charred bodies were found inside the docked boat, with four wounded bodies found outside, noting that the exact circumstances have not been determined.

The statement indicated that the killings reportedly resulted from armed clashes between rival traffickers.

UNSMIL called on ""Libyan authorities to ensure a swift, independent and transparent investigation to bring all perpetrators to justice,"" adding that the attack is a ""stark reminder"" of the lack of protection migrants and asylum-seekers face in Libya, and the ""widespread human rights violations undertaken by powerful trafficking and criminal networks who need to be swiftly stopped and prosecuted.""

Furthermore, the US Embassy in Libya also strongly condemned the incident, calling on the Libyan authorities to ""swiftly investigate this horrific attack, prosecute the criminals involved, and intensify efforts to combat human trafficking to the fullest extent.""

Sabratha is one of the major transit points for illegal migrants seeking to travel to Europe.

Since the start of the year, more than 14,000 migrants have been intercepted and returned to Libya, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

At least 216 people have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea, and 724 are missing and presumed dead.

The Red Crescent recovered dozens of bodies washed ashore in Khoms city in November 2020, which the group described as a terrifying disaster at the time.

The Red Crescent pointed out that it works with regional and international partners to support and assist migrants, stressing that it will continue to support migrants and displaced persons all over Libya by providing health services and ensuring communication with their families.

Meanwhile, SOS Mediterranee and the ALARMPHONE project issued a joint call to rescue a boat carrying 100 migrants off the Libyan coast.

The appeal, which was reported by the Italian agency ""Aki,"" stated that a hundred people are at risk off the coast of Libya after losing contact with them, pointing out that before the communication was cut off, one of the migrants reported to the two sides that the boat's engine failed and water started leaking into the ship."
1067003748,20221011,"France's foreign minister said on Tuesday five of its nationals were being held in Iran and the European Union had agreed the technical aspects to impose sanctions on Tehran, which would come into force next week.

France lashed out at Iran on Oct. 6 accusing it of ""dictatorial practices"" and taking its citizens hostage after a video was aired in which a French couple appeared to confess to spying, after weeks of unrest that Iran has linked to foreign foes.

France subsequently urged its nationals to leave Iran as soon as possible, saying they were exposed to the risk of arbitrary detentions.

""I hope to speak to the Iranian foreign minister today to ask once again for the immediate release of all our compatriots, who are held in Iran,"" Catherine Colonna told France Inter radio.

""There are currently five.""

Until now, Paris had not confirmed that a fifth citizen had been detained during the nationwide protests. Iran said last month that nine Europeans had been arrested in the unrest.

Ties between France and Iran have deteriorated in recent weeks as efforts to revive nuclear talks in which France is one of the parties have stalled. Neither country has an ambassador in place.

The anti-government protests in Iran over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody last month have pushed the EU to follow the United States, Canada and Britain in imposing sanctions.

""The EU agreed yesterday the technical aspects of a sanctions package that will target those behind the repression. ""It will be validated on Monday,"" Colonna said, referring to an upcoming meeting of EU foreign ministers."
1067007166,20221011,"Here are the highlights of events related to the war in Ukraine over the past 24 hours:

The US, the EU and the head of NATO strongly condemned the Russian missile strikes against Ukraine

The United States, the European Union and NATO's secretary general strongly condemned Russia's massive missile strikes against Ukraine and stressed that aid to Kyiv would not be cut. G7 leaders will hold a video conference today to decide what further sanctions to take against Moscow.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian side reports new Russian attacks, including on the Ladyzhyn TPP in the Vinnytsia region with kamikaze drones. Again, rocket strikes were carried out in the Zaporizhzhia region against infrastructure objects.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres accused Russia of an ""unacceptable escalation of war"".

Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called Russia a ""terrorist state"" during an emergency meeting of the organization. The general assembly was called over Moscow's annexation of four Ukrainian regions and took place hours after massive Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian cities.

""A bloody trail remains after the entry of the Russian delegation to this general assembly. The targeted hitting of civilian objects is a war crime. Russia once again proves that it is a terrorist state that must be deterred in the most categorical way,"" Kyslytsya pointed out.

In response, the representative of Russia did not touch on the missile strikes, but defended the annexation of Ukrainian regions by his country. The UN General Assembly rejected Russia's proposal for a secret vote on the prepared condemnation resolution for the annexation of Ukrainian territories. It is possible that the document will be voted on this evening by the 193 countries of the organization.

Russian President Vladimir Putin made no mention of the strikes in Ukraine with civilian casualties, but made it clear that yesterday's airstrikes were in retaliation for the Crimean bridge explosion, which he described as an act of terrorism.

The spokesperson of the High Representative for Foreign Policy and Security of the European Union, Peter Stano, defined the Russian claims about Bulgaria and the explosion of the Crimean bridge as ""deprived of even the slightest credibility"".

Before that, the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin, announced that the truck that blew up the facility had left from Burgas, Bulgaria.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the United States of obstructing the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. According to her, Washington only aims to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, which is ready for diplomacy, but only if its conditions are met.

Ukraine cannot be intimidated by missile strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky said:

""Why were such strikes made? The enemy wants us to be afraid, to make people run, but for us there is only one direction - forward, and we show this on the battlefield.""

Zelensky announced that he spoke with US President Joe Biden. The two discussed Ukraine's air defense, with Zelensky saying it is now the No. 1 priority in defense cooperation between Ukraine and the United States.

New rocket strikes on Zaporizhzhia last night

""Targets of the enemy are infrastructural objects,"" announced the chairman of the Zaporizhzhia OVA Alexander Starukh in Telegram. The information about the destruction and the injured is being clarified. ""Stay in the shelters!"" urged Starukh. The airstrike in the area continues.

The victims of the missile strikes in Ukraine are now 14. In his midnight message, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that electricity has been restored to the affected areas.

""Recovery work continues throughout the country. We will restore everything destroyed in the attack of the Russian terrorists. It is only a matter of time. I have given instructions to all services to proceed as quickly as possible. Ukraine cannot be intimidated. We are even becoming more united. Ukraine cannot be stopped. Now we are even more convinced that the terrorists must be neutralized,"" Zelensky said.

The European Commission is working on a way to provide Ukraine with budget support in the amount of about 1.5 billion euros per month next year, Politico reported, citing its sources.

In May, the EU promised 9 billion euros for the so-called macro-financial assistance for Ukraine, but only 6 billion euros of them received the support of the EU countries. So far, only 1 billion euros have been paid out. It is still being discussed how to provide the remaining 3 billion euros.

""The provision of short-term relief under macro-financial assistance to Ukraine has so far been ad hoc,"" said EU Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn.

""In view of the continued need for assistance, a more structured solution could be considered for a higher degree of predictability and I am working hard with [EU countries in a way] to allow us to have more structured, predictable and automated support at least for the next year,"" Khan added.

According to Kyiv's calculations, the deficit in the country's budget will be about 3.5 billion dollars per month next year. The US pledged to cover $1.5 billion a month, but asked its allies to provide support as well.

The EC is discussing with EU finance ministries how support can be provided. The total amount is still being discussed, the sources added. The details of how much of it will be grants or loans are also being discussed.

The proposals could be presented as early as next week or before the Ukraine Reconstruction Conference in Berlin on October 25.

Ukraine, Russia clash at UNGA ahead of vote on condemning Moscow's annexation of Ukrainian regions

Ukraine and Russia clashed in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on Monday ahead of a likely vote on a resolution on whether to condemn Moscow's annexation of four Ukrainian regions.

A resolution condemning Russia's annexation of four Ukrainian regions was up for adoption at the UNGA, where the 193 UN members vote and no one wields a veto. The vote will now likely take place this week, CNN said.

Speaking first at the emergency meeting, Ukraine's envoy Sergiy Kyslytsya told members states that he had already lost family members to Russian aggression. He said that around 84 missiles and around two dozen drones had deliberately targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure during Monday's multiple attacks on Ukrainian cities, including schools and universities.

""The entire world has once again, seen the true face of the terrorist State that kills our people. Suffering defeats on the battlefield, Russia takes it out on the peaceful residents of Ukrainian cities,"" he said.

The Ukrainian envoy said that voting for the draft resolution would be ""for each country, for each of our citizens, for your families, for our children - a vote for justice"".

The resolution on the Russian annexation comes days after Moscow vetoed a similar proposal in the UN Security Council. The draft resolution condemns Russia's ""attempted illegal annexations"" of the four Ukrainian regions following ""so-called referendums"".

The General Assembly meeting began with a procedural vote on a measure which Russia had flagged, proposing that the Ukrainian draft resolution being debated, be voted on by secret ballot, not through an open recorded vote.

The Albanian proposal received 107 votes in favor, with 13 against, and 39 abstentions.

Russia's ambassador Vassily Nebenzya said that the Albanian resolution, which confirmed that a recorded vote would take place following debate, had been a violation of the rules of procedure.

He said Russia had been deprived of the ability to present its case and all aspects of the Ukraine crisis that did not suit Western powers, had been conveniently overlooked.

""Ukraine was chosen by these countries for that purpose, was brought under their control and today is a platform for the testing of NATO weaponry and for combat against Russia, using other people,"" he said.

He accused Ukraine of an act of terrorism in ""sabotaging"" Russia's bridge to Crimea, adding that Russia could not stand by and let Ukraine act ""with impunity"".

This vote comes after Russia conducted that large-scale strikes on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and other locations on Monday, which drew condemnation from several countries. UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was deeply shocked and represented ""another unacceptable escalation"" of the war.

The strikes which have reportedly caused widespread damage to civilian areas and led to dozens of deaths and injuries showed that ""as always"", civilians were paying the highest price for Russia's invasion of February 24, the statement released by the UN Spokesperson added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday warned of ""harsh"" reprisals after the Crimea bridge attack on Saturday. In a television appearance, Putin said Russia had struck military and infrastructure targets across Ukraine following the Crimea bridge blast.

He threatened further ""harsh"" responses that correspond ""to the level of threat to the Russian Federation, have no doubt about it,"" while accusing Kyiv of ""terrorism.""

The total sanctions of the EU against Russia - 123 billion euros or 40% of the turnover of goods and services

After the EU agreed on the eighth package of sanctions against Russia, the value of all trade restrictions amounted to about 123 billion euros, according to documents of the European Commission (EC).

According to calculations, this amount is equal to 40% of the total turnover of goods and services between Moscow and the European Union last year.

""Under this amount, the EC understands the volume of bilateral trade between Russia and EU countries, which existed in 2021, but is now impossible due to official sanctions,"" the publication says.

According to the EC, the new sanctions will affect Russian imports into the EU worth 7 billion euros. In total, restrictions on supplies from Russia are estimated at nearly 90 billion euros.

""Before the new round of sanctions, the European Commission estimated the volume of restrictions on the export of goods and technologies to Russia at 24.8 billion euros, and now - at almost 30 billion euros,"" the publication claims.

The European Commission also states that losses due to the embargo on EU services exports to Russia amount to €3 billion.

Last week, the EU agreed on the eighth package of sanctions. It envisages, among other things, an extension of the period of personal sanctions, as well as a ban on the transportation of oil to third countries by sea at a price exceeding an as-yet-undetermined limit. The measure will come into effect from December, and for petroleum products - from February.

In addition, restrictions apply to the import of finished steel products, machinery, vehicles, chemicals and materials for the manufacture of jewelry that are not made of gold. Also prohibited are the provision of consulting, legal and IT services to Russian companies, the export to Russia of electronic components suitable for weapons and technical products used in aviation, as well as the provision of online cryptocurrency wallets to Russian individuals and legal entities.

Russia threatens to respond to increasing Western aid to Ukraine

Ukraine turned the tide of the war and successfully resisted the Russian troops, who were exhausted.

This was stated in a statement by the head of the British intelligence agency, Jeremy Fleming, the BBC reported.

According to the agency, the Russians are running out of ammunition, and the Russian president's decision to bomb was wrong. Russian military losses in men and equipment are staggering, and all successes of Russian troops since the first months of the war have been reduced to zero, the statement added.

Direct conflict with the United States and NATO is not in Moscow's interest, but it will respond to the West's growing interference in the Ukrainian conflict, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said, as quoted by RIA Novosti and Reuters.

""It is obvious that a direct confrontation with the US and NATO is not in Russia's interest. We warn and hope that Washington and other Western capitals realize the danger of uncontrolled escalation,"" Ryabkov warned, adding that Moscow would have to take ""adequate countermeasures, including asymmetric,"" due to the increasing involvement of the United States and Europe in the ""conflict with Ukraine.""

A similar threat was made by the Russian ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov. “We urge the US and its allies not to cross the red lines they have come close to. Stop pumping the regime with lethal weapons. This will only lead to new casualties and destruction and further prolong the conflict,” Antonov warned.

Ryabkov noted that Moscow is concerned about the ""continuous large-scale aid"" that Kyiv receives. His words come after United States President Joe Biden said Washington would supply Ukraine with advanced air defense systems.

Last night, Joe Biden promised that Washington would provide Ukraine with advanced air defense systems, among other forms of ""support"" that Kyiv needs ""to defend itself.""

1067005618,20221011,"(Bloomberg) -- European natural gas prices picked up as Russia’s fresh strikes across Ukraine raised concerns about fuel flows crossing the war-torn country.

For now, gas transit remains stable, including shipment orders for Wednesday. Yet, Kyiv decided to stop electricity exports to the European Union given the damage to its energy infrastructure, making markets nervous about risks to gas pipelines. Benchmark futures rose as much as 7.6% before paring some gains.

Shipments through Ukraine are the last remaining Russian supplies to western Europe after major links including the damaged Nord Stream network were shut since the start of the war. The dwindling flows have pushed EU economies to the brink of recession and have sent governments rushing to protect consumers.

Ample supplies of liquefied natural gas have helped Europe fill winter stockpiles to 91%, above average, providing a buffer for the colder months. But “prices remain full of risk with the escalation in conflict and potential for gas infrastructure to be targeted,” analysts at UK supplier SEFE Energy said in a note.

Dutch front-month gas, Europe’s benchmark, settled 1.7% higher at 156.78 euros per megawatt-hour, after hitting the lowest level in more than three months on Monday. The UK equivalent contract finished 1% higher.

European energy markets remain tight amid low hydro reservoir levels in Norway and lower output from France’s troubled nuclear fleet.

With no increase in Russian gas flows in sight, the continent continues to chase more alternative supplies while also pushing for energy savings. Italy’s Eni SpA started additional LNG shipments from Africa. Spain said it aims to cut gas consumption this winter by as much as 14%, pushing companies and local governments to use less of the vital fuel.

Major economies are also taking steps to ease the burden on consumers, with Germany preparing a series of measures that could include subsidies for gas consumption for households and businesses. The UK government has expanded its energy subsidy program for businesses to cover contracts signed as far back as December last year.

Yet, traders are worried those steps could have side-effects, potentially slowing much needed demand destruction.

If gas usage is not decreasing as strongly as necessary, Europe’s fuel stockpiles “could dwindle to a critical level towards the end of winter,” analysts at Commerzbank AG said in a note. “The easing of gas prices -- which at present are only around half as high as they were at the end of August and in early September -- could therefore prove short-lived.”"
1067008925,20221011,"CHISINAU (Reuters) – Ukraine reduced electricity supplies to Moldova by about 30% early on Tuesday, Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said.

Ukraine announced on Monday that it was suspending electricity exports to the European grid after Russian missile strikes that hit its energy network and killed at least 19 people.

Moldova, a poor former Soviet republic that borders Ukraine and Romania, was already concerned about its energy supplies before the Russian missile strikes on Ukraine on Monday as it is heavily dependent on Russia for gas.

“We are in constant contact with Ukraine, the European Union and Romania in search of a solution to provide the republic with electricity,” Spinu wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian state energy company Gazprom said last week that it may switch off gas supplies to Moldova if the country fails to comply with its payment obligations by Oct. 20."

1067018798,20221011,"Kyiv was struck by multiple missiles for the first time in months Monday, and several other Ukrainian cities took severe blows in what Russian President Vladimir Putin called retaliation for a weekend explosion on a major Russian-built bridge.

At least 14 civilians were killed and nearly 100 were wounded, Ukraine Emergency Service reported. Homes, businesses, roads and vehicles were left in ruins and much of the country was deprived of power just two days after a major bridge linking occupied Crimea with the Russian mainland was damaged by an apparent truck bomb. Putin blamed Ukrainian special forces for that blast.

""If attempts continue to carry out terror attacks on our territory, Russia’s responses will be tough,"" Putin said at a meeting with members of Russia’s Security Council. ""No one must have any doubts about that.""

Putin said his Defense Ministry used long-range air, sea and ground-based precision weapons to strike Ukrainian energy, military command and communications facilities. However, civilian areas like a playground and a university were also hit.

President Joe Biden, who spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday, issued a statement pledging support for Ukraine. He condemned the strikes that ""killed and injured civilians and destroyed targets with no military purpose"" and demonstrate the ""utter brutality of Mr. Putin’s illegal war"" on Ukraine.

Biden and Zelenskyy said they discussed the need for improved air defense, and the Ukrainian leader later called that ""the number 1 priority.''

Missiles hit civilian infrastructure in the center of Kyiv during morning rush hour. Among other major cities battered by the strikes in at least 14 regions were Dnipro in the center of the country, Lyiv in the west, Kharkiv in the northeast and Zaporizhizia in the south.

Ukraine's military said Russia launched 84 missiles, mostly from drones, and 56 of them were shot down by Ukrainian air defenses. Critical infrastructure, mostly energy supply, was hit in eight regions, and more than 30 fires broke out in Kyiv alone, authorities said.

""The world once again saw the true face of a terrorist state that is killing our people,"" Zelenskyy said in a social media post. ""On the battlefield & in peaceful cities. A country that covers its true bloody essence & goal with talks about peace.""

►The Russian Defense Ministry said the attacks were successful: ""The purpose of the strike was achieved. All designated objects were hit.""

►Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said power was being shut off to some areas of the capital to repair damage to critical infrastructure. Power and water supplies were damaged in the attack, he said.

►Residents of several European countries, including Germany, Poland, Italy, Austria, Romania and Georgia, protested Monday's missile attacks outside Russian embassies.

►In an emergency meeting Monday, the U.N. General Assembly debated how to respond to Russia's claim of annexing four Ukrainian provinces after sham elections. A vote is expected later in the week on a proposal to condemn the “referendums” and claimed annexations as illegal.

►Despite being under pressure from Ukrainian forces in the northeast and south, the Russians are focused on taking over the Donetsk province of the Donbas region, making a strong push toward the town of Bakhmut, the British Defense Ministry said.

Lindsey Graham: Putin’s missile attacks the 'act of a very desperate man'

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Monday that Vladimir Putin's missile attacks are the “act of a very desperate man” and the Russian president is “piling on” war crimes in Ukraine.

“His military is melting away before our eyes,” Graham said in an interview with USA TODAY. “So he’s desperate. He’s upping the ante here by attacking civilian targets.”

The Ukrainians are mounting a strong response, Graham said, but they need more air defense capability, longer-range artillery and additional tanks.

“And the threats of nuclear retaliation by Putin have to be met or resolved. He's trying to use nuclear weapon blackmail, and we can't get into that because that’ll become the standard in the future,” Graham added. “And the most dangerous thing we could do is be intimidated by him and give up the fight.”

President Joe Biden warned last week of the prospect of Armageddon if Putin deploys tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The comment went too far for Graham.

“I don't know why he talked in those terms. That was a mistake,” Graham said. “But I'll say this: They've been slow – the Biden administration – in terms of sanctions and weapons, but we're in a pretty good spot right now.”

Graham, who serves on the Appropriations Committee and is the ranking member on the Budget Committee, said he intends to work with the administration when the Senate reconvenes after the midterm election to pass a robust military and economic package for Ukraine.

Ukraine foreign minister says Putin is using Crimea bridge blast as an excuse

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the international media not to suggest that Putin was provoked into Monday's attacks by the Crimean bridge blast, saying that narrative ""shifts the blame on the victim of the aggression."" Kuleba says Russia was hammering Ukraine cities with missiles for months before Saturday's explosion on the Kerch bridge, and any expansion of those attacks is a reflection of Putin being ""desperate"" because of battlefield defeats.""

""Putin ... uses missile terror to try to change the pace of war in his favor,"" Kuleba said. ""He does not need anything to 'provoke' him in order to commit heinous crimes.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he spoke with Kuleba, reiterating support for Ukraine following the Kremlin's ""horrific"" attack.

""We will continue to provide unwavering economic, humanitarian, and security assistance so Ukraine can defend itself and take care of its people,"" Blinken tweeted.

Russian military bloggers and political commentators rejoiced Monday at the news of missile attacks on several Ukraine regions that killed at least 14, though some of the pundits said the strikes should go further and damage energy infrastructure in the long term.

Ramzan Kadyrov, the Moscow-backed leader of Chechnya who has advocated for more attacks on Ukraine, proclaimed himself “100 percent happy.”

War correspondent Andrei Kots of Komsomolskaya Pravda, the top Russian tabloid, pushed for “a new mode of action to the entire depth of the Ukrainian state until it loses its capacity to function.”

Pro-Kremlin political analyst Sergei Markov may have alluded to the real reason behind the strikes when he said, “The Russian public wants massive attacks.''

Europe pledges more support to Ukraine after latest strikes

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the Russian attacks.

""Such acts have no place in 21st century,"" Borrell said. ""We stand with Ukraine. Additional military support from the EU is on its way.""

British Prime Minister Liz Truss called the attacks a ""clear sign of Putin's desperation."" She said Ukraine is succeeding and that Britain will continue to provide military aid.

Germany plans to provide Ukraine with the first of four new air defense systems within days. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Monday's assault ""makes it clear how important it is to deliver air defense systems to Ukraine quickly.""

French President Emmanuel Macron told Zelenskyy in a phone conversation that France would increase its support for Ukraine ""in response to the needs formulated by Kyiv, including those related to military equipment,"" European Pravda reported.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said it temporarily paused its work in Ukraine amid the most recent bombings but continues to provide services. The agency said it was committed to remaining in Ukraine and will continue its activities while adapting to the ""deteriorating security situation"" on the ground.

""Given the security situation in Ukraine today, our teams momentarily paused movements, sheltered and continued to work in place,"" the agency said. ""Our full schedule of humanitarian assistance will resume immediately as the security situation allows.""

The Red Cross has worked in Ukraine since 2014 and scaled up its response to meet the rising needs when the war began in February. The agency has about 700 staffers in 10 locations across Ukraine to deliver relief items to the displaced, provide medicines and supplies to health care facilities, restore water supply and other lifesaving activities.

Borrell is lamenting the EU's slow pace of action in setting up a military training mission for the Ukrainian armed forces. Foreign ministers are due to discuss the plan next week, almost eight months after the war started.

Borrell told EU ambassadors Monday that “we had been discussing about the Ukrainian training mission before the war. Before the war. For months.” He says that “then the war comes and people said, ‘Oh, we should have done it.' Yeah, we should have done it. And now we are doing it quickly."""

1067012741,20221011,"The United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on Iran’s Morality Police along with senior Iranian security officials for using threats of violence to control what Iranian women should wear. The sanctions come amidst ongoing protests in Iran over the death of a woman in the custody of the Morality Police.

The British Foreign Office issued a statement announcing the sanctions on Iranian security officials and the Morality Police on Monday. The ministry cited the Morality Police’s use of threats of detention and violence against women to control what they wear and behave in public. The ministry also cited Amini’s death in the custody of the Morality Police and the other deaths of women that followed amidst the ongoing protests calling for the downfall of Iran’s clerical regime.

Iran’s Morality Police chief Mohammed Rostami Cheshmeh Gachi and the Head of the Tehran Division Haj Ahmed Mirzaei were also the officials sanctioned. Five other officials that were sanctioned include the IRGC’s Basij Head Gholamreza Soleimani, Iranian police NAJA Special Forces Unit commander Hassan Karami, and Iranian police Commander-in-chief Hossein Ashtari.

“The UK stands with the people of Iran who are bravely calling for accountability from their government and for their fundamental human rights to be respected,” said Foreign Secretary James Cleverly.

“These sanctions send a clear message to the Iranian authorities – we will hold you to account for your repression of women and girls and for the shocking violence you have inflicted on your own people,” said Cleverly.

Tehran has sought to blame Iran’s enemies, such as the United States, for the protests that have continued for weeks.

The sanctions would mean that the officials and groups targeted cannot travel to the UK and the freezing of any assets they hold in the country. The sanctions were also made by British laws that aim to encourage Iran to comply in line with international human rights law.

France and the European Union are also set to impose sanctions on Iran in light of the ongoing protests. France accused Iran of “dictatorial practices” by taking five of its nationals hostage following a video that showed a French couple appearing to confess to espionage. The bloc has so far agreed on the technical aspects of a new sanctions package on Iran."
1067020741,20221011,"Children of my Gaza refugee camp were rarely afraid of monsters but of Israeli soldiers. This is all that we talked about before going to bed. Unlike imaginary monsters in the closet or under the bed, Israeli soldiers are real, and they could show up any minute – at the door, on the roof or, as was often the case, right in the middle of the house.

The recent tragic death of a 7-year-old, Rayyan Suleiman, a Palestinian boy from the village of Tuqu near Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank, stirred up so many memories. The little boy with olive skin, innocent face and bright eyes fell on the ground while being chased by Israeli soldiers, who accused him and his peers of throwing stones. He fell unconscious, blood poured out of his mouth and, despite efforts to revive him, he ceased to breathe.

This was the abrupt and tragic end of Rayyan's life. All the things that could have been, all the experiences that he could have lived, and all the love that he could have imparted or received, all ended suddenly, as the boy lay face down on the pavement of a dusty road, in a poor village, without ever experiencing a single moment of being truly free, or even safe.

Adults often project their understanding of the world on children. We want to believe that Palestinian children are warriors against oppression, injustice and military occupation. Though Palestinian children develop political consciousness at a very young age, quite often their action of protesting against the Israeli military, chanting against invading soldiers or even throwing stones are not compelled by politics, but by something else entirely: their fear of monsters.

WATCH: Palestinian boy, 7, dies after being chased by Israel army

This connection came to mind when I read the details of the harrowing experience that Rayyan and many of the village children endure daily.

Tuqu is a Palestinian village that, once upon a time, existed in an uncontested landscape. In 1957, the illegal Jewish settlement of Tekoa was established on stolen Palestinian land. The nightmare had begun.

Israeli restrictions on Palestinian communities in that area increased, along with land annexation, travel restrictions and deepening apartheid. Several residents, mostly children from the village, were injured or killed by Israeli soldiers during repeated protests: the villagers wanted to have their life and freedom back; the soldiers wanted to ensure the continued oppression of Tuqu in the name of safeguarding the security of Tekoa. In 2017, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy, Hassan Mohammad Al-Amour, was shot and killed during a protest; in 2019, another, Osama Hajahjeh, was seriously wounded.

The children of Tuqu had much to fear, and their fears were all well-founded. A daily journey to school, taken by Rayyan and many of his peers, accentuated these fears. To get to school, the kids had to cross Israeli military barbed wire, often manned by heavily armed Israeli soldiers.

Sometimes, kids attempted to avoid the barbed wire so as to avoid the terrifying encounter. The soldiers anticipated this. ""We tried to walk through the olive field next to the path, instead, but the soldiers hide in the trees there and grab us,"" a 10-year-old boy from Tuqu, Mohammed Sabah, was quoted in an article by Sheren Khalel, published years ago.

The nightmare has been ongoing for years, and Rayyan experienced that terrorising journey for over a year, of soldiers waiting behind barbed wires, of mysterious creatures hiding behind trees, of hands grabbing little bodies, of children screaming for their parents, beseeching God and running in all directions.

Following Rayyan's death on 29 September, the US State Department, the British government and the European Union demanded an investigation, as if the reason why the little boy succumbing to his paralyzing fears was a mystery, as if the horror of Israeli military occupation and violence was not an everyday reality.

Rayyan's story, though tragic beyond words, is not unique but a repeat of other stories experienced by countless Palestinian children.

When Ahmad Manasra was run over by an Israeli settler's car, and his cousin, Hassan, was killed in 2015, Israeli media and apologists fanned the flames of propaganda, claiming that Manasra, 13 at the time, was a representation of something bigger. Israel claimed that Manasra was shot for attempting to stab an Israeli guard, and that such action reflected deep-seated Palestinian hatred for Israeli Jews, another convenient proof of the indoctrination of Palestinian children by their supposedly violent culture. Despite his injuries and young age, Manasra was tried in 2016, and was sentenced to twelve years in prison.

Manasra comes from the Palestinian town of Beit Hanina, near Jerusalem. His story is, in many ways, similar to that of Rayyan: a Palestinian town, an illegal Jewish settlement, soldiers, armed settlers, ethnic cleansing, land theft and real monsters, everywhere. None of this mattered to the Israeli court or to mainstream, corporate media. They turned a 13-year-old boy into a monster, instead, and used his image as a poster child of Palestinian terrorism taught at a very young age.

The truth is, Palestinian children throw stones at Israeli soldiers, neither because of their supposedly inherent hatred of Israelis, nor as purely political acts. They do so because it is their only way of facing their own fears and coming to terms with their daily humiliation.

Just before Rayyan managed to escape the crowd of Israeli soldiers and was chased to his death, an exchange took place between his father and the soldiers. Rayyan's father told the Associated Press the soldiers had threatened that, if Rayyan was not handed over, they would return at night to arrest him along with his older brothers, aged 8 and 10. For a Palestinian child, a nightly raid by Israeli soldiers is the most terrifying prospect. Rayyan's young heart could not bear the thought. He fell unconscious.

OPINION: From Muhammad Al-Durra to Rayyan Suleiman my heart grieves for Palestinian children

Doctors at the nearby Palestinian hospital of Beit Jala had a convincing medical explanation of why Rayyan has died. A paediatric specialist spoke about increased stress levels, caused by ""excess adrenaline secretion"" and increased heartbeats, leading to a cardiac arrest. For Rayyan, his brothers and many Palestinian children, the culprit is something else: the monsters who return at night and terrify the sleeping children.

Chances are, Rayyan's older brothers will be back in the streets of Tuqu, stones and slingshots in hand, ready to face their fears of monsters, even if they pay the price with their own lives."

Klaar was speaking at the defense committee of the European Parliament.

“The decision on sending a mission must yet be adopted by the member states in the political and security committee. Full support from member states of the union, as well as the European Parliament are extremely important for implementing the peacemaking efforts of the European Union,” Klaar said.

The European Union will send a monitoring mission to the Armenian-Azerbaijani border to “build confidence” and facilitate the work of an Armenian-Azerbaijani commission on delimitation."

CHISINAU. Oct 11 (Interfax) - The Moldovan GRES regional power plant in Transdniestria became the sole power supplier to Moldova on October 11, Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister, Infrastructure and Regional Development Minister Andrei Spinu said.

""Starting from 3 a.m. today, Moldova has been receiving all electric power it needs from Moldovan GRES thanks to Moldovagaz's daily allotment of an additional 0.9 million cubic meters of gas to Moldovan GRES to generate the required amount of electricity,"" Spinu said on a social network.

It is the primary task of the authorities to provide households with electricity at the minimal price, he said.

The actions taken by Russia in Ukraine's regard on Monday directly affected Moldova, which was buying 30% of electricity from Ukrainian companies, Spinu said.

He did not say how Moldovagaz would enlarge gas supply to Moldovan GRES. It is possible that Moldovagaz will use the reserves created over the past two months, which roughly amount to 55 million cubic meters of gas.

Spinu said he had discussed possible solutions to the problem of power supply to Moldova with representatives of Ukraine, Romania and the European Union on Monday.

Moldova buys electricity from Moldovan GRES in Transdniestria. The contracts used to be concluded for one year, but their term was reduced to one month from March due to the energy crisis and fluctuating gas prices. Gazprom cut gas supply to Transdniestria in May, and Moldovan GRES warned Chisinau it would be able to supply Moldova with only 70% of the required electricity. Moldova was compensating for the deficit with power supply from Ukraine since May. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on October 10 that Russia delivered ""a massive strike by long-range precision-guided air-, sea- and ground-launched weapons at energy and communication facilities and military commands of Ukraine."""
1067037566,20221011,"The agreement will include the demarcation of borders

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in an interview on Tuesday that Armenia and Azerbaijan reached an agreement on the crucial aspects of the ceasefire deal.

According to the minister, “it remains to implement them.” The two neighboring countries engaged in a deadly armed conflict in September over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh border region.

Baku and Yerevan traded blame for “provocations” that reportedly killed 207 Armenians and 77 Azerbaijan's citizens.

“An agreement was reached on the principal points - there were five of them. This includes the recognition of each other’s territorial integrity, the demarcation of borders, etc.,” Cavusoglu told TVnet.

According to him, the peace negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan cannot proceed separately from Ankara’s normalization of ties with Yerevan. The minister also added that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s recent meeting with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in Czech Republic’s Prague was “positive.”

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron held a meeting with Armenian and Azeri leaders on the sidelines of the inaugural summit of the European Political Community in Prague. The parties agreed that the European Union will send a ""civilian mission"" to Armenia to help delineate the borders with Azerbaijan."
1067042004,20221011,"Here's what to know as Kenya's votes on August 9:

After the death of more than 1,100 people in violence after the 2007 election, technology was proposed as a way of bolstering transparency around polls and reducing the delay in announcing results, a major source of tension.

In the subsequent 2013 and 2017 elections, results were transmitted electronically, and biometrics used to register voters and identify them on polling day.

Biometric voter registration has been a success, boosting the electoral roll from 14.3 million in 2013 to 19.6 million in 2017 and 22.1 million in 2022.

On election day, voters provide their fingerprints for identification against a digital database, before casting their ballot in a traditional manner using a pen and paper.

Technology comes into play again when polling stations close and votes are counted.

To limit the possibility of fraud, the official form displaying the outcome from each polling station will be photographed and transmitted digitally, instead of officials inputting the results manually as was the case in 2017.

The photographs are pooled at a constituency level, then forwarded to a national tally centre, where they are cross-checked against the original forms which are physically transported.

Kenya's first stab at using voting technology in 2013 was not a success -- the system broadly failed, forcing the election commission to return to manual methods.

The fiasco damaged public trust in electoral technology. The opposition, led by Raila Odinga, said it was a deliberate act of sabotage by Uhuru Kenyatta, his presidential rival who won the vote.

During the next election in 2017, the biometric systems worked without a hitch, but problems in delivering the results electronically formed the basis of Odinga's successful legal challenge to Kenyatta's re-election.

The Odinga camp claimed, again, that technology had been manipulated to favour the incumbent.

OT-Morpho, the French company that supplied the voting systems, denied any manipulation or hacking had occurred.

But in a landmark ruling, Kenya's highest court, citing irregularities in the transmission of results, invalidated Kenyatta's victory and ordered a fresh vote.

An observation mission deployed by the European Union to monitor the vote noted an ""improved use of technology, but insufficient capacity or security testing"".

When the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) ran a test in June, less than half of the 2,900 polling stations successfully transmitted results.

Another rehearsal in July, across a reduced number of locations, saw a 92 percent rate, but the outcome didn't inspire confidence.

""We have 46,233 polling stations... So that's still a grey area. We don't know with certainty that the system of transmission will work 100 percent,"" said Mulle Musau from the Elections Observation Group, a Kenyan poll watchdog.

This year, nearly 1,300 polling stations are in areas with little to no internet coverage, an improvement on the last election when 11,000 locations were in the dark.

The IEBC says results will be transmitted from these locations by satellite, and that precautions are in place to avoid any failure.

More than 55,000 electronic machines used for identifying voters and sending results have been deployed across the country, and each is powered by two stand-alone batteries.

""It requires internet only when it is transmitting results. It is offline. It cannot be hacked,"" said Justus Nyang'aya, an IEBC official.

Election officials say back-up kits have been provided, and polling officers can fall back on manual methods, like a paper voter registry, as a last resort.

""Technology has made our elections much more complex, much more unclear and therefore opaque,"" Musau said.

""When they (voters) feel things are clouded... that is what becomes very dangerous. The biggest problem with our Kenyan elections is one word: trust.""

British firm Smartmatic, which replaced OT-Morpho as the software provider for this election, has denied criticism that its technology -- used in polls from Uganda to Venezuela and the Philippines -- has flaws.

""Unfortunately, election processes, in general, are vulnerable to disinformation. Bad actors systematically disseminate lies to undermine elections by inciting fear, anxiety and distrust among voters and stakeholders,"" a Smartmatic spokeswoman, Samira Saba, told AFP by email.

Episodes of criminality involving electoral technology have undermined public confidence in the security and reliability of these systems.

In June, electoral officials said about one million voters had had their constituencies switched without their knowledge on the national database.

The changes had been reversed on the registry and three electoral officers arrested, officials said, but the episode did not allay fears about the perceived opacity of these technologies."
1067042006,20221011,"LNG carrier rates hit an all-time high on Tuesday, driven by growing prompt demand for gas in Europe as the continent tries to procure supply ahead of the winter.

The freight rate to charter an LNG carrier in the Atlantic basin surged to $397,500 per day on Tuesday, according to Spark Commodities estimates cited by Bloomberg.

The price to hire an LNG ship has now surged by 500% this year, as Europe is looking to import increased volumes of LNG to replace Russian pipeline gas, and north Asia is also preparing for the winter.

The new record for Atlantic LNG freight rates was higher than the previous record of $374,000 per day set on Monday, as assessed by Spark Commodities.

Europe's demand has left few LNG ships available, and some buyers are now concerned they may not be able to charter vessels to bring in the gas, according to traders who spoke to Bloomberg.

Europe's demand for LNG surged by 65% in the first eight months of 2022 compared to the same period a year earlier, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its latest quarterly Gas Market Report earlier this month.

For the first time ever, the European Union imported in June more LNG from the United States than gas via pipeline from Russia, as Moscow slashed its supply to Europe.

In September, as much as 70% of all U.S. LNG exports were headed to Europe, up from 63% in August, per Refinitiv Eikon data cited by Reuters earlier this month.

The race to buy LNG and charter LNG carriers could create the next big shortage in the energy market—not enough vessels to transport LNG from exporters to buyers, analysts and traders say.

The LNG shipping industry is set for a record-breaking quarter this quarter, and deals at freight rates of $1 million per day are not to be ruled out, according to maritime consultancy Drewry cited by Lloyd's List.

1067047436,20221011,"In the Netherlands, sectors that use intellectual property rights (IPR) above average account for 28.7% of employment. That is equivalent to 2.17 million jobs, says the European Patent Office (EPO) in a press release. One of the results from the report by the EPO and the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) is that the economic impact of companies working on technologies to combat climate change has grown.

Companies using IPR use patents, trademarks, copyrights, registered designs or plant breeders’ rights in that period directly employed more than 61 million people in the EU. In addition to the 28.7% employment, IPR sectors also provide 41.9% of the gross national product. The sectors that use IPR the most are horticulture and flower wholesale (trademarks and plant breeders’ rights), medical devices (patents), chemical products (patents), food industry (patents, trademarks, plant breeders’ rights and registered designs) and cosmetics (patents and trademarks).

The study also shows that the Netherlands is the EU location of choice for foreign companies interested in innovations and patent-intensive sectors. This applies to companies from both inside and outside the EU. 31% of all Dutch jobs in patent-intensive companies are created by foreign companies (Germany 21%, France 24% and Belgium 23%). The Netherlands is especially attractive to companies outside the EU: of the 31% mentioned, more than half come from companies outside the EU, the highest percentage compared to any other European country.

The study shows that IPR-intensive companies active in developing climate change mitigation technologies and in “green” trademarks are a boon to the European economy. Their economic impact has also increased in recent years and accounted for 9.3% of employment and 14.0% of the gross national product in the EU during 2017-2019. Overall, every tenth European patent application filed by an EU company or inventor in 2019 related to technologies that reduce or prevent greenhouse gas emissions. Green trademarks filed by EU companies accounted for a similar share of all EU trademark applications in 2021.

EPO President António Campinos: “Innovation, supported by an efficient intellectual property rights system, is the key to ensuring Europe’s long-term growth and competitiveness. This report also shows that IPR-intensive sectors are more important than ever for the European economy. So it is good news for companies and inventors that Europe’s innovation environment will soon receive an additional boost with the introduction of the European patent with unitary effect and the European Patent Court.”"

1067058068,20221011,"Today researchers from Phasecraft, the quantum algorithms company; the University of Bristol; and Google Quantum AI published the results of an ambitious experiment in Nature Communications. The article, “Observing ground-state properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model using a scalable algorithm on a quantum computer,” describes how Phasecraft has taken an important first step towards using quantum computers to determine low-energy properties of strongly-correlated electronic systems that cannot be exactly solved by classical computers.

Modelling quantum systems of this form has significant practical implications, including the design of new materials that could be used in the development of more efficient solar cells and batteries, or even high-temperature superconductors. However, doing so remains beyond the capacity of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. The Fermi-Hubbard model is widely recognized as an excellent benchmark for near-term quantum computers because it is the simplest materials system that includes non-trivial correlations beyond what is captured by classical methods. Approximately producing the lowest-energy (ground) state of the Fermi-Hubbard model enables the user to calculate key physical properties of the model.

In the past, researchers have only succeeded in solving small, highly simplified Fermi-Hubbard instances on a quantum computer. This research shows that much more ambitious results are possible. Leveraging a new, highly efficient algorithm and better error-mitigation techniques, Phasecraft and their research partners successfully ran an experiment that is four times larger – and consists of 10 times more quantum gates – than anything previously reported in the literature. The work was partly funded by the ERC through Prof Ashley Montanaro’s Consolidator Grant “Quantum Algorithms: from Foundations to Applications,” and partly by UKRI through the EPSRC Prosperity Partnership scheme, which enabled the collaboration between the partners.

“The Fermi-Hubbard instance in this experiment represents a crucial step towards solving realistic materials systems using a quantum computer,” says Phasecraft co-founder, and Professor of Quantum Computation at the University of Bristol, Ashley Montanaro. “And we succeeded by developing the first truly scalable algorithm that anyone has managed to implement for the Fermi-Hubbard model. That’s particularly exciting because it suggests that we will be able to scale our methods in order to leverage more powerful quantum computers as the hardware improves.”

Phasecraft brings together many of the world’s leading quantum scientists and engineers and partners with the world’s leading developers of quantum hardware. Their research has led to fundamental breakthroughs in quantum science and is aimed at significantly reducing the timescale for quantum advantage in several critical areas. Beyond developing algorithms that will be able to scale to larger quantum computers, the Phasecraft team is also focused on continuing to build practically relevant features into their models so that they more accurately represent real-world systems.

“We are delighted to see this experiment designed and executed by Phasecraft, representing one of the largest digital fermionic simulations to-date, and also one of the largest variational algorithms to-date, performed on Google's quantum computing hardware,” says Ryan Babbush, Head of Quantum Algorithms at Google AI. “The scalability of their approach derives from being state-of-the-art in terms of both error-mitigation and algorithm compilation for near-term quantum hardware.”

“This experiment represents a new milestone. It tells us what today’s quantum computers are capable of when we apply the best algorithmic technology available,” says Stasja Stanisic, Senior Quantum Engineer at Phasecraft, the paper’s lead author. “We can build on this work to develop better algorithms and better encodings of realistic problems for today's devices.”

Klaar said that the situation remains extremely dangerous, and that the European Union must help Armenia and Azerbaijan build a prosperous South Caucasus.

The diplomat acknowledged that Armenia’s soverign territory was invaded and its civilian infrastructure was destroyed.

Klaar also weighed in on the plans to unblock transport communications in the region. According to him, road and rail links between Nakhijevan and the rest of Azerbaijan can only be established if it is clear to everyone that said roads are the sovereign territory of Armenia. He said that was what was agreed when the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, France and the European Union met in Prague earlier in October.

The rights and security of Armenians in Karabakh must be ensured in a transparent and inclusive manner, so that Armenia and the Armenians of Karabakh feel that these agreements ensure their security where they live."

According to Azatutyun.am, which cited diplomatic sources in Brussels, the E.U. body is currently discussing details—how many, from which countries and when will they arrive in Armenia. However, the mission definitely will arrive in Armenia, sources said.

Toivo Klaar, the special representative of the European Union in the South Caucasus, spoke Monday about the importance of the mission in the European Parliament’s Defense Committee.

“The full support of the member states, as well as the European Parliament, is extremely important to realize the peace-loving efforts of the European Union,” Klaar said.

The decision to deploy an E.U.-led civilian mission to Armenia was announced late last week after a lengthy talks between the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, France and the E.U. According to the statement, the civilian mission will begin in October and will last two months.

Baku reportedly had rejected the E.U.’s proposal to send a military mission to the border, but it did not object to a civilian mission. It said that it will cooperate “to the extend in which it can.”

European Union foreign affairs minister Josep Borrell informed Azerbaijan’s foreign minister Jeyhun Bayramov about the E.U. intention to send the civilian mission.

Borell and Bayramov reportedly discussed the situation in the region.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday, in a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, welcomed what he deemed as progress in peace talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

The European ambassador did not rule out that some of the monitors may be from Georgia, which is not part of the E.U. but has had a mission there since 2008 after the brief Russia-Georgia war.

In the case of Georgia, Azatutyun reported, there are 200 unarmed montors from various E.U. countries, who monitor the borders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia for 24 hours in an effort to instill confidence in residents living on either side of the administrative border and to ensure their security. The E.U. monitors in Georgia also brief various European bodies about the situatuin on the ground.

The priority of the E.U. Civilian Mission in Armenia, according to Azatutyun, also will be to prepare reports that will eventually assist in the process of delimitation and demarcation of borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan."
1067061229,20221011,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Union is weighing handing new powers to its fledgling public prosecutor’s office amid concerns the bloc’s current system is failing to rein in rich Russians trying to evade sanctions.

New powers for the Luxembourg-based European Public Prosecutor’s Office would be conditional on separate plans to make sanctions evasion a crime under EU law, according to people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.

The idea comes after the EU set up a “freeze and seize” task force in March to improve coordination among member states, which are in charge of the enforcement of EU sanctions. Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg account for almost all of the 17.4 billion euros ($16.9 billion) in Russian assets that have been frozen in the bloc so far, according to EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders.

The possible new EPPO powers would supplement a draft proposal that seeks to boost EU nations’ powers to seize criminal assets, including those of sanctioned Russian individuals and entities, by extending the list of crimes such as money-laundering and corruption to include the violation of EU sanctions.

Current rules have been hampering more far-reaching efforts across the bloc to go beyond freezing assets. To be able to seize assets the EU needs justification of a criminal nature. Separately, the EU last week adopted new sanctions powers that will allow it to target people and entities that are helping to circumvent the bloc’s restrictive measures.

The Luxembourg-based public prosecutor’s office, which became operational in June, has 22 EU member nations and is headed by Laura Codruta Kovesi, a Romanian who ignited an unprecedented anti-corruption drive in her home country that landed the country’s most powerful politician behind bars.

The plan to beef up the role of the EU institution is still at a very early stage and would require the backing of the bloc’s 27 nations, the people said. The EU’s justice chief Reynders is likely to float the idea at a ministerial meeting in Luxembourg this week to weigh initial reactions, one of the people said.

The EPPO declined to comment and the European Commission didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the possible measures."

BUDAPEST, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- Peter Szijjarto, Hungary's minister of foreign affairs and trade, said here on Tuesday that he will travel to Moscow this Thursday to deliver a strong message of peace and to discuss ways to ensure Hungary's energy supplies.

He will be there to participate in the event ""Russian Energy Week"".

""It is clear that the escalation in Ukraine is moving in an extremely dangerous direction. Now we are really in the last moment to reverse the events,"" he said at a press conference held with Slovenia's minister of economic development and technology Matjaz Han.

""Instead of escalation efforts and war rhetoric, I think it would be time for us in Europe to switch to focusing all our efforts on creating peace,"" he said.

He said he will meet with representatives of Russian energy giant Gazprom, state nuclear company Rosatom and government officials in charge of Russia's energy policy for talks on ways to prevent an energy shortage in Hungary this winter.

Szijjarto is the only European Union (EU) minister to attend the event in Moscow.

""Those who criticize me for this (participating in ""Russian Energy Week"") do not want peace, they are not interested in whether the Hungarian people will have energy supply or not,"" he said.

Although Hungary's government voted together with other EU members in favor of Western sanctions against Russia, it is fervently opposed to extending the sanctions to Russia's energy sector. Enditem"
1067069652,20221011,"Germany's parliament is debating its deployment of troops to Mali and other Sahel states that are part of the multinational European Union Training Mission in Mali (EUTM) and the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MINUSMA).

""The deployment of the Bundeswehr is becoming more and more of a complete disaster,"" said Sevim Dagdelen, a member of the Bundestag for German's socialist Left Party (Die Linke) and spokeswoman for international relations and disarmament.

Escalating protests against the West followed by a spike in jihadi activities and political upheavals in many Sahel countries forced France to withdraw its troops from Mali in mid-March, putting an end to its Barkhane and Takuba anti-terrorist operations.

Germany has about 300 troops under EUTM mandate and 1,000 soldiers as part of MINUSMA in Mali. When France withdrew its troops, it left the Bundeswehr soldiers without any air cover. However, the lower house of German parliament, the Bundestag, voted in April to extend the troops' mission.

Some German politicians were not happy. Dagdelen said: ""Neither the rescue chain nor sufficient protection from the air is secured."" She added it was ""irresponsible"" to leave the Bundeswehr there.

The Bundestag agreed to extend the Bundeswehr mission under a so-called opt-out clause with MINUSMA. Under this agreement, ""measures to readjust Germany's contribution including ending the mission can be called into play"" if the protection of German soldiers can no longer be adequately guaranteed. The resolution thus leaves room to maneuver.

Meanwhile, attention has shifted to Burkina Faso, which in September was hit by its second military coup this year, overthrowing the leaders who took power in an earlier coup. The new strongman, Ibrahim Traore, is not expected to hold democratic elections until 2024 at the earliest.

The regime in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, only has about 30% of the country's lands under its control.

Traore vowed to stand up to Burkina Faso's growing Islamist insurgency — the main reason why he toppled the previous coup leader, Colonel Sandaogo Damiba.

Unlike his predecessor, Traore has not ruled out seeking Russia's help to achieve his goals. There is huge support among the population for him to do so.

Mali and the Central African Republic have sought Moscow's help to deal with their unrest. In return, Russia's private military firm Wagner Group — accused of serious human rights violations — would extend its spheres of political influence in the region.

With its attention focused on the war in Ukraine, many wonder if Moscow currently has the means to enter into another theater of fighting jihadis.

Nonetheless, many in Ouagadougou want the new junta regime to reach out to Moscow. Immediately after Traore announced his putsch, Alassane, a tailor working in the Burkinabe capital, told French news agency AFP that he ""only sewed Russian flags.""

""There were some orders in bulk,"" he said.

Mali's new military rulers still maintain strong ties to Moscow. Earlier this week, junta leader Colonel Assimi Goita phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin to intensify their partnership, according to Russian media.

Amid the growing food crisis and price hikes, Putin promised to provide humanitarian aid to low-income Sahel countries in the form of 300,000 tons of artificial fertilizer.

Despite his renewed focus on Moscow, Colonel Goita's has maintained a working relationship with Germany. In this tense situation, top politicians in the German governing coalition want out of the Mali mission immediately.

Some strong objections to the mission were recently made in the Die Welt newspaper by Joe Weingarten of the Social Democrats and Marcus Faber of the business-friendly FDP .

But Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock of Germany's environmentalist Green Party is sticking to the mission. The three parties form Germany's coalition government.

Not just yet

""We currently have to monitor the situation day by day and discuss it intensively,"" Agnieszka Brugger, the deputy head of the Green party parliamentary group, told DW.

That is the current consensus in the Bundestag and in its Defense Committee. However, Brugger does not see withdrawal any time soon and does not consider it sensible from a foreign policy standpoint.

However, she acknowledges that the involvement of Russian mercenaries will lead to a further deterioration in the human rights and security situation.

""We've been observing for a long time that countries like China, but above all Russia, are also trying to expand their influence in the Sahel region,"" Brugger said.

Such rhetoric does not put the concerns and needs of the civilian population first, but Brugger says it is precisely against this backdrop that Germany needs to proceed with caution.

""We already observe that the Russian operations in northern Mali are taking place with a very high degree of ruthlessness,"" she said. Brugger believes that withdrawing the Bundeswehr will leave the fields entirely to these forces.

""MINUSMA is making a major contribution to stabilizing Mali and the Sahel,"" said Wendyam Sawadogo, a political scientist and conflict researcher in Ouagadougou.

Many expected a clear outcome after nine years of international troops' presence in the Sahel. But according to Sawadogo, the negative attitude of the military government did not make things any easier.

In an interview with DW, the expert who works for the Dutch think tank Clingendael warned that the rise of Russian influence in the Sahel — which is sometimes cited in Berlin as a reason for withdrawal demands — will increase if the German mission ends.

""International development partners should avoid taking an impulsive stance on the Russian presence. Rather, the European Union should focus on improving its relations with countries like Mali and Burkina Faso,"" Sawadogo said.

More recently, the French engagement in the Sahel was under massive criticism, as a result of which the country withdrew militarily from Mali. The accusation: The former colonial power is primarily covering up its own economic interests with its military action — now especially in Niger.

Step out of the French shadow

Left-wing MP Dagdelen also slams the French presence in the Sahel.

For example, she cites the fact that France runs its nuclear power plants with Nigerien uranium, while the population of the Sahel state suffers from blackouts and hunger.

""Germany is increasingly in danger of being perceived as an accomplice to the dirty French colonial policy,"" said Dagdelen.

Green parliamentary group leader Agnieszka Brugger admitted that there have been shortcomings: Berlin and Brussels have not carried out a comprehensive assessment of France's involvement in Mali for a long time.

""This is something that we should have discussed much earlier and much more clearly at European level,"" said the Greens' defense expert.

""And we would have needed a common European strategy and a stronger commitment from Germany instead of sitting out certain, even difficult, issues,"" Brugger maintained.

For Brugger, there is no question that a rethink is necessary in the Sahel. She considers it particularly important that the civil processes are given even more support alongside military action.

""It must be clear that security forces can only be trained in a stable political environment, with reliable actors who are also interested in political reforms,"" said Brugger.

""Otherwise it can quickly come to a coup and in the end our contributions do not achieve what we originally wanted, but in the worst case also cause damage,"" she added.

It is not without reason that the European Training Mission (EUTM) stopped working in Mali and is now working in Niger. There is a government in power that is sticking to a pro-Western policy — at least so far.

1067069655,20221011,"TALLINN – Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said at a meeting with Rwandan Prime Minister Edouard Ngirente in Tallinn on Tuesday that Russia's aggression in Ukraine is undermining the entire world order based on the UN Charter.

Kallas met with Ngirente on the fringes of the Tallinn Digital Summit. The prime ministers discussed bilateral relations as well as the security situation in both Africa and Europe, government spokespeople said.

According to Kallas, Estonia and Rwanda are both countries that consider digital issues to be important. ""We are united by the rapid development of the digital field, there is close communication between the representatives of our ICT communities and there are several projects in the works. I hope that productive contacts on IT and digital topics will continue and that we will find new areas, such as education, in which to cooperate with Rwanda,"" the prime minister said.

Speaking about security issues, the prime ministers recognized that regional security also affects global security. ""It is important for Estonia to contribute to ensuring well-being and stability more broadly than just in Europe. That is why, for example, we are participating in the European Union's training mission in Mozambique, where we provide training to the country's security forces,"" Kallas said.

Kallas stressed at the meeting that in Europe, we have to face Russia's unprecedented aggression against the independent and sovereign state of Ukraine. ""This is a gross violation of international law and Russia is undermining the entire world order based on the UN Charter,"" she said. ""We must make it crystal clear to Russia that the international community does not accept such behavior and fully support Ukraine. We all have an important role to play here, and I thank Rwanda for voting in the UN General Assembly for resolutions condemning Russian aggression,"" the prime minister added."

1067075176,20221011,"(Tribune News Service) — With Russia’s war in Ukraine in its eighth month, some European nations that have funneled weapons to Kyiv are running low, and it could take years for defense contractors to meet the shortfall.

NATO states are urging companies to boost production to help them restock — to both resupply Ukraine and reinforce their own stores in a climate of heightened tension, according to people familiar with the matter. That’s as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates his threats, including warning of a potential nuclear attack, with his troops facing numerous setbacks on the ground in Ukraine.

Kyiv’s allies have already sent in billions of dollars in arms, munitions and equipment since Russia invaded in February. That’s putting pressure on ammunition stockpiles, including 155 mm shells for artillery, some of the people said, of which the U.S. has given Ukraine well over a million rounds since the start of the war.

Defense companies in the U.S. and Europe are now seeing demand rise for air defense and anti-tank arms alongside other equipment, with governments increasingly recognizing that Ukraine will probably need military support for years to come. But it will be a struggle to quickly expand manufacturing after decades of limited orders.

As the war drags on, Ukraine’s partners may be tempted to prune back support as they worry about their own security needs, potentially creating the types of fissures Putin is seeking to exploit alongside tensions over access to energy in Europe. Apart from multiple launch rocket systems, Ukraine’s allies have mostly focused on sending it Soviet-era weapons and tanks, which are also running low in supply.

Those stocks need to be replaced with modern weapons. At the same time, North Atlantic Treaty Organization members need more arms to shore up the alliance’s presence on its eastern flank.

Defense ministers will meet in Brussels this week to discuss these issues, following a gathering of national armaments directors in late September. “Enhancing NATO stockpiles will ensure we can keep supporting Ukraine,” Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said after that meeting.

It could take years before supply catches up with demand. Defense companies face hurdles to expand production to the scale that is necessary. European defense firms will also have to modify assembly lines after many governments cut defense spending following the Cold War and as the focus on equipment shifts back to what has worked for Ukraine.

Defense spending in Europe and Canada amounted to a total of around $310 billion in 1990, before dropping off for two decades, according to data from NATO, which bases the figures on 2015 prices and exchange rates. Only after 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, did spending start to pick up again.

“We’ve been operating in that modus for decades and now all of a sudden we’re entering a totally different ball game,” said Burkard Schmitt, defense and security director at the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe. “You have to scale up massively and this is simply an enormous effort and takes time because you have to reconfigure everything.”

Firms are also struggling to access certain semiconductors and rare-earth metals, while skilled workers are in short supply.

On an analyst call on April 26, Raytheon Technologies Corp. Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes said the company wouldn’t see orders come in before 2023 at the earliest for larger replenishments of Stinger missiles and Javelin anti-tank munitions, noting difficulties sourcing materials needed to produce them. Both Stingers and Javelins have played a role in helping Ukraine beat back Russian troops.

“Unfortunately, DOD hasn’t bought a Stinger in about 18 years and some of the components are no longer commercially available,” Hayes said at the time, referring to the Pentagon. He said Raytheon would have to redesign some of the electronics in the missile, and “that’s going to take us a little bit of time.” The U.S. Army in May subsequently awarded the company a $624 million contract to produce 1,300 Stinger missiles, including support to address “obsolescence, modernize key components, and accelerate production.”

Dassault Aviation SA Chief Executive Officer Eric Trappier on July 20 echoed concerns about supply chains and a shortage of skilled workers, stressing it would take at least an additional year to increase the pace of production of its fighter aircraft, which already take approximately three years to manufacture.

“If we have to accelerate, we will accelerate, but we need time to accelerate,” Trappier said. “We can’t just click our fingers and accelerate the delivery of fighter aircraft.”

While allies haven’t sent Western-made fighter jets to Ukraine, the European Union in a defense investment gap analysis published in May recommended member states modernize their fleets of multi role fighter aircraft. It also suggested countries upgrade and expand their inventory of main battle tanks and armored fighting vehicles, and invest in frigates, submarines and high-end interconnected ships.

Officials are trying to work out how to better communicate their procurement needs with industry so that companies can invest in production for the long-term. And while they want to replenish stocks, governments also need to be wary about excessive stockpiling given the shelf lives of some weapons.

That constraint was highlighted in August, when Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles said her government wouldn’t send Ukraine the Leopard tanks it had been considering after finding them in a deplorable state after years of disuse, according to media reports.

“The industry both in our country and around the world want to know, is there a sustainable longer-range plan for this production,” William LaPlante, the U.S. defense acquisition chief, told reporters after the national armaments directors meeting. “And not that this will be something which has traditionally been feast or famine; that we go into panic mode, we increase production, and then when the crisis passed, we just go back to minimal production again.”

LaPlante said allies were looking into setting clearer standards. That would, for example, allow for ammunition to be used in artillery produced somewhere else, while countries would consider joint procurement to create larger quantity orders for industry.

While defense spending has become a priority since Russia’s invasion, it’s unclear how long that will remain the case, particularly in Europe, where nations face a potential energy crisis this winter, according to Lucie Béraud-Sudreau, director of the military expenditure and arms production program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

Countries’ spending needs are going to increase further if they want to keep pace with China, when it comes to investing in emerging technology, she said.

“With the difficult economic situation we’re getting into, there’s going to be trade offs,” Béraud-Sudreau said. “There are tough decisions coming for European governments.”"

1067078673,20221011,"The European Union's energy commissioner hailed a ""long-term strategic partnership"" with Algeria Tuesday as the bloc turns to Africa's biggest gas exporter to fill a gap left by Russian supplies.

""As the relationship with Russia, so far EU's biggest gas supplier, is irreversibly broken, we are turning to the EU's reliable suppliers to fill in the gap,"" said Kadri Simson.

""In this respect we are offering Algeria a long-term strategic partnership.""

Simson is the latest in a string of top European officials to visit Algeria in search of more natural gas, since Russia cut gas supplies to Europe in suspected retaliation against Western sanctions after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Algeria has helped Europe diversify its energy supplies by pumping more gas to Italy, which in July signed a deal to import billions more cubic metres via an undersea pipeline from the North African coast.

Europe's hunt for gas has become ever more urgent as winter approaches, but experts have cast doubt over Algeria's ability to boost output in the short term.

Algerian Prime Minister Aimene Benabderrahmane however said state hydrocarbons firm Sonatrach had put in place an ""accelerated programme"" to bump up output.

Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab, speaking at an energy summit in the capital Algiers attended by Simson, said his country was ""a trusted supplier"" that always honours its contractual obligations.

He added that Algeria was examining the possibility of laying high-voltage cables under the Mediterranean to export electricity to Europe, and that the country hopes to produce as much as 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035.

Simson said she wanted the EU to help Algeria reduce its methane emissions and boost its electricity output from renewables.

""Algeria has one of the highest solar based energy potential in the world,"" she said in a tweet. ""The EU is ready to help Algeria unlock this potential."""
1067078674,20221011,"While addressing the 77th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 23, 2022, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yet again called upon global leaders to take effective actions to ensure safe, voluntary, and sustainable Rohingya repatriation to Myanmar. Notably, more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims escaped state-sponsored violence and persecution from Myanmar to Bangladesh in August 2017, creating a colossal catastrophe.

Hasina alleged that the protracted issue of Rohingya refugees sheltered in Bangladesh has serious ramifications for her country’s economy, security, and socio-political stability. She cautioned that if the crisis remains unresolved, it possibly will cause instability and insecurity in the “region and beyond.”

Obviously, the uncertainty over the Rohingya people’s repatriation to Myanmar has generated pressing concerns and frustrations for the Bangladesh government. Besides economic difficulties, there has been an alarming rise in cross-border organized crime as well as human and drug trafficking. Hasina also voiced concerns that challenging situation could possibly “fuel extremism” in Bangladesh.

Nonetheless, the present political chaos and armed clashes inside Myanmar make the repatriation of the displaced Rohingya refugees even more difficult. Another major hurdle to resolving the crisis are the unfavorable policy responses by China and Russia – two permanent members of the Security Council with veto powers.

Despite having cordial and warm relations with the above-mentioned two world powers, Bangladesh has failed to obtain their crucial support on the Rohingya issue. Mainly because of geopolitics, both the countries remain strong strategic partners of the Myanmar regime. Both are providing substantial arms and ammunitions to strategically significant Myanmar, while China’s investment in numerous development projects in the country hit $21 billion in March 2020. Both China and Russia opposed a U.N. resolution on the Rohingya issue in December 2017, and they have repeatedly maintained that the Rohingya refugee issue is a bilateral problem between Bangladesh and Myanmar and should not be debated at international fora.

Nonetheless, Hasina has urged the United Nations to play an effective and tougher role to resolve the crisis at every opportunity. Notably, in her previous speeches to the UNGA (2017, 2018, and 2019), Hasina also raised the protracted Rohingya issue and put forward proposals for their safe, voluntary and dignified early return.

Significantly, a day before her address to the UNGA this year, Hasina also floated a five-point proposal at an important side event on the prolonged crisis and pushed for more tangible actions by the international community. Her five points are:
• Fully support the Rohingya people politically as well as financially;
• Legally support trials at the International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court in order to implement international law and help fight against violations of human rights in Myanmar;
• Build robust pressure on Myanmar to halt continual subjugation of ethnic and religious minorities;

Notwithstanding the repatriation agreement inked between Bangladesh and Myanmar on November 23, 2017, not a single Rohingya stranded in Bangladesh could be repatriated to their motherland in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. The security situation in Myanmar has worsened significantly since then, as a result of the military overthrow of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and imposition of state of emergency. Notably, Aung San Suu Kyi’s government also ignored the recommendations of the 2017 Kofi Annan-led Special Advisory Commission’s report, which called for restoration of rights and citizenship of the Rohingya people.

Regrettably, apart from providing substantial humanitarian assistance, there has been limited response by the United Nations to deal with the Rohingya crisis, even though the U.N. and other major world actors have strongly condemned it as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited Bangladesh on July 1-3, 2018 to see the plight of the Rohingya. Assuring Bangladesh, he said, “We’re keeping up pressure on Myanmar… we need to put more pressure on Myanmar to make them understand what they should do on this issue.”

Also, on September 18, 2018, the U.N. Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar restated its demand for the investigation and prosecution of Myanmar’s Commander-in-Chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, and other top military leaders for genocide and crimes against humanity. The United States , Australia, and the European Union have also imposed a series of sanctions on the Myanmar military leaders, including imposing arms embargoes since the coup. The targeted sanctions are positive steps to demoralize the merciless Myanmar military.

However, Bangladesh expected more concrete and intense diplomatic pressure from the global community to force Myanmar to take back their people. Notably, earlier diplomatic efforts and engagements with the top most civilian and military leaders of Myanmar as well as with the U.N. and other international bodies have failed to ensure a lasting solution to the crisis.

The Rohingya crisis poses an enormous challenge for Bangladesh and threatens its national security. Hasina’s speech in the UNGA emphasized the problem, and her five-point proposal for more effective and determined actions by the international community was her latest attempt to find a permanent resolution to the Rohingya crisis. Will the international community take more drastic measures?"
1067078676,20221011,"Europe has managed to fill its gas storage sites to nearly 90% as winter approaches, but stocking up on gas has come at a price. Gas and energy prices are now so high that energy-intensive industries are shutting down production lines or whole factories, while households are constantly being asked to conserve gas and electricity to avoid rationing and/or blackouts this winter. The EU, most of which is now deprived of any gas supply from Russia, is doing relatively well with stocking up on alternative supply. The prices, however, are high, and so is the price that industries, residential consumers, and governments must pay.

As of October 9, gas storage sites in the EU were 88.58% full, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe. Storage in Germany, the biggest economy, was 94% full, and the one in Italy—at 92.7%.

“Europe really wanted this time around to have their storage full. They kind of learned a lesson last winter that it’s not a good thing [to not have enough gas in storage], especially if the supply is not given or is uncertain,” Anna Mikulska, Nonresident Fellow at the Center for Energy Studies, Baker Institute, said last week.

“Currently the storage is at a very high level, sometimes 100 percent, most of the time beyond 80 percent,” Mikulska said at the panel ‘Energy Market Update: Winter Is Coming’ last week.

Yet, “This did not come at zero cost,” the industry expert said.

Europe is paying high prices for LNG, and these prices are determined by traders in a tight market, not by the U.S. LNG producers and exporters, Mikulska said during the panel.

“It’s the companies that buy the gas from U.S. producers, and it usually goes where the price is highest,” she said.

American LNG has been crucial in meeting European demand, which is scrambling for gas supply and willing to pay up for spot deliveries, outbidding most of Asia.

High demand in Europe, high natural gas prices, and increased export capacity made the United States the world’s largest LNG exporter in the first half of 2022, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in July.

For the first time ever, the European Union imported in June more LNG from the United States than gas via pipeline from Russia, as Moscow slashed its supply to Europe.

In September, as much as 70% of all U.S. LNG exports in September were headed to Europe, up from 63% in August, per Refinitiv Eikon data cited by Reuters earlier this month.

But this influx of LNG supply to secure Europe’s winter comes at a cost.

“It came at a cost of cutting down demand in industry. And that’s the big story of this winter and the year coming forward. It’s not only about the inability to heat houses, which obviously is something that you are going to prevent, but it’s about the ability of Europe to recover going forward from the industrial downturn that cutting supply of gas to industry has caused,” Mikulska said.

Due to sky-high prices and a very tight gas market, natural gas usage in the power-generating sector in Europe is forecast to drop by nearly 3% this year. Industrial gas demand is expected to plunge by as much as 20%, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its quarterly Gas Market Report early this month.

Energy-intensive industries in Europe, including aluminum, copper, and zinc smelters and steel makers, have already warned EU officials that they face an existential threat from surging power and gas prices.

“All the signs point to markets remaining very tight well into 2023,” Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s Director of Energy Markets and Security, said.

Despite the high LNG imports and the rush to build LNG import terminals, Europe could still face rationing or power outages this winter, and a longer-term deindustrialization as energy-intensive industries relocate some production out of the continent.

The EU has admitted that the increased supply of non-Russian gas needs to be coupled with reductions in demand if the gas market is to balance any time soon. Germany’s regulator has been calling for months for “significant” cuts in gas consumption to avoid a gas emergency and subsequent rationing of gas use."
1067081034,20221011,"Within the last decade, a much-misunderstood political revolution has been gathering force across the Western world. It is not a coordinated or ideologically driven movement but, rather, a series of similar developments occurring in disparate countries that, taken together, constitute a profound shift in the political direction of the West. Commonly called “populism,” it also can be described as “nationalism,” or, in the view of some, “patriotism.” Its fundamental tenet is the principle of sovereignty, the idea that the direction and best interests of independent nation-states should be determined by the democratically elected leaders of those countries and not by external doctrines or supra-national organizations led by unelected officials who are essentially unknown to and unaccountable to the people whose destinies they seek to influence.

Some regard populism as alarming, even dangerous. Global elites and their media acolytes routinely denounce it as a “threat to democracy,” when, in fact, what they really fear is the “threat of democracy” and its capacity to independently exercise powers such as taxation, regulation and border controls that can be very inconvenient to multinational entities.

The political revolution that is populism is best seen as a direct reaction to an earlier economic revolution — “globalization” — which, despite the best intentions of its proponents, has over the past quarter-century greatly exacerbated the world’s problems of income inequality, class conflict and political polarization. In old-fashioned language, the rich have gotten richer and the poor have gotten poorer. In terms of the globalization sweepstakes, populism is a revolt of the more numerous losers against the more powerful winners.

In the Academy Award-winning 1976 film “Network,” Peter Finch portrayed a frustrated television anchorman who leans out his office window and shouts, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore!” That character could well be seen as the prototype for today’s populists.

Upon being elected president of the United States, Barack Obama famously stated that “Elections have consequences.” Populism has been principally empowered by elections. In smaller countries, such as Hungary, Poland and Sweden, elections have had smaller consequences; in larger countries such as Great Britain, the United States or Italy, elections have had larger consequences. What they all have in common, however, is that they have conferred significant governmental power upon leaders who were seriously committed to addressing the political, economic and cultural anxieties of the mainly working, middle-class voters who elected them.

Three rapidly occurring events propelled populism from being a marginal and regional phenomenon to becoming a central force in most Western countries.

The first was the bold decision by the European Union (EU) in 2015, inspired by then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to open its borders to over 2 million migrants, principally refugees from the war-torn Middle East. This decision almost immediately generated controversy and disunity between the Mediterranean EU members, who bore the brunt of the financial and cultural impacts of this exodus, and those further north who did not.

The second event, in the following year, was the highly divisive Brexit election, in which the migration issue evidently made a significant difference in the unexpected and narrowly decided vote that ended Great Britain’s EU membership.

In the third event, just months after Brexit, illegal migration through America’s porous southern border became a significant issue in the divisive and narrowly decided election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.

Critics of globalization, such as Harvard economist Dani Rodrik and French demographer Christophe Guilluy, have demonstrated that its effects damage the world’s poorest nations in the same way that they damage the poorer classes of Western societies. In the past few years, the harms done to these vulnerable peoples, from economic blows to education deficits to food insecurity, have been magnified by the global pandemic and, more recently, the war in Ukraine.

Across the Western world, the political, economic and social trend lines are not encouraging. Perhaps most urgently, we need leaders who can transcend familiar, parochial concerns, acknowledge past policy errors, and demonstrate the strength and courage to mitigate the ills flowing from globalization and ameliorate its combustible conflict with populism. The time available for these daunting tasks is not limitless.

1067089465,20221011,"Hungary has committed to setting an example when it comes to public procurement transparency and fighting corruption, Tibor Navracsics, the minister for regional development and the uptake of EU funds, said on Tuesday.

Presenting data published by the European Union’s anti-corruption taskforce OLAF, Navracsics pointed to the falling number of cases the body had referred to the Hungarian authorities between 2016-2021.

Regarding public procurement procedures and corruption, Hungary has “whitened” considerably, Navracsics said.

The document published by the European Commission shows that while Hungary “still has room for improvement”, its public procurements are no longer considered seriously problematic, he said.

Hungary has committed to steps in six areas as part of its negotiations with the European Commission, Navracsics said.

The government is setting up the Integrity Authority to help the fight against corruption. The authority will be up and ready by Nov. 19, he said. The authority’s anti-corruption working group composed of government officials and representatives of civil organisations will be functioning by December, he added.

They will strengthen the country’s anti-corruption framework and transparency in the use of European Union funding, he said. One of the steps involves adopting regulations against conflict of interest not implemented in any other member state, he said. Lawmakers’ asset declarations will also be reformed, he said.

Hungary will also strengthen audit and control functions and amend regulations regarding crime connected with exercising public office and handling public funds, he said."
1067089466,20221011,"It said security forces had killed at least 30 protesters, injured another 825, and arrested more than 2,000 in the predominantly Kurdish regions.

Reuters could not independently verify the report.

The Hengaw human rights group said on Monday security forces had fired towards residences in the Kurdish city of Sanandaj.

The Iranian authorities have blamed the violence on an array of enemies including armed Iranian Kurdish dissidents, with the Revolutionary Guards attacking their bases in neighbouring Iraq a number of times during the latest unrest.

Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi reiterated accusations that Iranian Kurdish dissident groups were supporting the protests and said security forces would ""neutralize the desperate anti-revolutionary effort"".

Unrest continued elsewhere overnight after demonstrations spread into Iran's vital energy sector, according to videos on social media which Reuters could not confirm.

Energy installations in southwestern Iran were hit by strikes for a second day on Tuesday, with workers protesting at the Abadan oil refinery, Kangan and the Bushehr petrochemical plant, according to the widely followed Tavsir1500 Twitter account.

Videos posted on the account showed a few dozen workers chanting ""Death to the dictator"", referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

A regional official said on Tuesday the workers at the Assaluye plant were angered by a dispute over wages and were not protesting over Amini's death.

Governor Ali Hashemi said some Iranians had tried to hijack the workers' protests by chanting anti-government slogans, according to Iran’s Young Journalists Club News (YJC) Telegram account.

It was a combination of mass protests and strikes by oil workers and bazaar merchants that helped to propel the Shi'ite clergy to power in the Iranian revolution four decades ago.

Dozens of universities are also currently on strike, with students playing a pivotal role in the protests.

Meanwhile, in the city of Fuladshahr in the central province of Isfahan protesters set fire to the office of a prayer leader, according to a video posted by Tavsir1500.

The authorities' crackdown on protesters has prompted some Western states to draw up more sanctions on Iran, stoking diplomatic tensions at a time when talks to revive Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers are at a standstill.

France's foreign minister said on Tuesday five of its nationals were being held in Iran and the European Union had agreed the technical aspects to impose sanctions on Tehran, which would come into force next week.

This ECOWAS Regional Cybersecurity Competition has the main objective of identifying talent and supporting young people in the field of technology, in order to create a stable cyber workforce in the region.

The first part of this competition took place online throughout the month of August at the national level and made it possible to select the best team from each Member State. This regional final phase therefore brings together eleven (11) finalist countries from ECOWAS and Mauritania.

Each team, made up of talented young men and women, will be invited to take up several challenges in the field of cybersecurity. Thus, from October 10 to 12, 2022, over forty participants will compete non-stop for 48 hours. The opening ceremony which preceded the launch of the competition was marked by two (2) speeches including that of the representative of the Director General of ASIN who indicated that cybersecurity is a crucial area for the digital economy and encouraged the participants to show their know-how to solve the problems related to the information system.

Ambassador Amadou Diongue, Resident Representative of ECOWAS in Benin, on behalf of the President of the ECOWAS Commission, HE. Dr. Omar Alieu Touray indicated that the Internet is transforming processes in all sectors of activity, fostering innovation and development, but at the same time we are witnessing the increase in very harmful cyber activities. As such, the regional hackerlab should be seen as an exciting and collaborative avenue to identify and recognize talent and support budding young techies in the region to lay the foundation for building a cybersecurity workforce. Before launching the competition, he wished the participants good luck by telling them the importance of this Hackerlab competition.

This “HACKERlab 2022” competition marks ECOWAS’s desire to effectively fight against cyber threats.

1067100768,20221011,"Joint statement by the High Representative, on behalf of the European Union, and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe

On European and World Day against the Death Penalty, the European Union and the Council of Europe firmly reiterate their unequivocal opposition to the death penalty at all times, in all places and in all circumstances.

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances. We commend all those Council of Europe Member States (including all of the EU Member States) that have abolished the death penalty in all circumstances and we call on the last two Member States of the Council of Europe that have not yet acceded to this Protocol – Armenia and Azerbaijan – to do so without delay.

The steady worldwide decline in the number of states still applying the death penalty confirms the global trend towards abandoning this cruel, inhuman and ineffective punishment. A minority of 18 states, 9% of the total number of UN Member States, still carried out executions in 2021. We call on those states to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty as a first step towards abolition.

The EU and the Council of Europe strongly condemn the death sentences recently issued in the occupied Ukrainian city of Donetsk. We stress that these sentences were incompatible with both European human rights law and international law, including the Geneva Conventions and welcome with relief the release of the sentenced individuals. Equally, we deplore the politically-motivated amendment of the Criminal Code of Belarus – extending capital punishment to ""attempted terrorist acts"", with the eventual aim of targeting political dissents – and we urge the authorities to reverse this decision. We also call on Singapore, Iran, Saudi Arabia and other countries that have recently increased the number of executions to join the worldwide trend and abandon the use of this inhuman punishment.

The EU and the Council of Europe praise Kazakhstan for having ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which aims to abolish the death penalty worldwide. We also commend Papua New Guinea, Central African Republic and Equatorial Guinea for having abolished the death penalty this year.

Inhuman and degrading treatment is inherent to the death penalty. Death row contributes to the long-term physical and psychological decline of a person's health. The mental anguish of anticipating execution, and brutal methods of execution used are contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR, as long recognised in the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.

Finally, the EU and the Council of Europe encourage all states to join the Global Alliance for Torture-Free Trade, which was launched in 2017 and currently involves 62 states committed to restricting the trade in goods used to carry out torture and capital punishment.

The death penalty is an inhuman and degrading treatment, contrary to human dignity. It does not serve as a deterrent to crime. No legal system is safe from judicial errors, which may lead to the loss of innocent lives. We will not stop advocating until the death sentence is no longer applied.

1067102698,20221011,"The day after Yom Kippur, Israel’s interim Prime Minister Yair Lapid planned to sign an agreement that would make Israeli citizens living in the towns of Katzrin, Ariel and Pisgat Ze’ev second-class citizens, at least in terms of their right to consume culture. The agreement that was supposed to be signed with the European Union would have officially and institutionally discriminated against everyone who lives in areas beyond the Green Line, including the Golan Heights, the Old City of Jerusalem and the Jerusalem neighborhoods built after the 1967 Six-Day War.

Minister of Culture Hili Tropper refused to admit that these are the consequences of signing the agreement. This denial is false.

Signing the agreement would be unprecedented. In 2017, the Israeli government specifically refused to sign the agreement precisely because of the territorial issue. Although it was reported last summer that the government had decided to move forward with the agreement, the decision only concerned the actual conduct of the negotiations. Now, after the end of the negotiations and Israel’s surrender to the territorial discrimination clause, the agreement was expected to be signed and come into effect during Lapid’s October visit to Europe.

In the past, under much heavier political pressure, Israel signed the Horizon 2020 program that funds scientific research, which also includes the same territorial discrimination. But there is no reason to repeat such a mistake. Moreover, the cultural agreement is worse than the Horizon agreement because the latter “only” discriminated against scientific institutions. For example, Ariel University could not receive E.U. funding. Government funds can compensate for this kind of damage. Cultural funding, however, involves consumers. The cultural agreement would mean that anything using E.U. funds, such as an exhibition or an entire theater, would not be able to operate in the Old City of Jerusalem or in Katzrin. This is discrimination that is prohibited under Israeli law.

In addition to this, the scientific agreement was in a highly competitive field where countries are fiercely fighting for supremacy. With all due respect, this is not the case in the fields of, say, dance or visual arts.

More importantly, since the signing of Horizon 2020, Israel has garnered major and hard-won political achievements, such as anti-BDS laws passed in many U.S. states and prohibitions on boycotting the settlements; American recognition of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights; and the change in American policy that enabled the funding of research institutions in Judea and Samaria.

Signing this latest regressive text will set Israel back diplomatically by at least a decade and weaken anti-BDS laws and anti-boycott actions. How can American activists demand that U.S. states punish Ben & Jerry’s for refusing to sell beyond the Green Line while the State of Israel agrees that the Europeans can pay theaters in Israel to do exactly that?

After Horizon 2020, the E.U. did not wait long. It immediately acted to anchor the separation between the territories inside and beyond the Green Line in the lamentable U.N. Resolution 2334. Israeli leaders, including the current leadership, claim that they are determined to fight Resolution 2334. This cannot be done if the Israeli government signs an agreement that actually implements the resolution.

Israel will do all this damage for a handful of euros—a few million a year. Israel will pay 33 million euros for the agreement and will receive back funding, according to estimates, of about seven million euros per year.

Signing the cultural agreement is unprecedented. It will harm Israel’s supporters fighting BDS; it will harm Israel’s claims against its detractors; it will cause prohibited discrimination against about 800,000 Israeli citizens—and all this for a very small profit.

1067104733,20221011,"July 13, 2022 (KHARTOUM) – The Troika and European Union on Wednesday called for talks between the political forces and the component military in Sudan to define the role and responsibilities of the army leaders after the decision to withdraw from politics.

On July 4, the head of the military-led Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said they decided to not participate in the dialogue process or the transitional government. However, he said they would form a higher military body to deal with security and defence issues with some additional powers in related fields.

In a joint statement on Wednesday, the international supporters of democratic transition, the Troika and the European Union took note of al-Burhan’s announcement to withdraw from the dialogue process.

They called on the military leaders to remain committed to this pledge and called on the political groups swiftly to hold inclusive talks to form a civilian-led transitional government that enjoys “broad-based, nation-wide support”.

“There must also be full clarity on, and oversight of, the military’s role and responsibilities. Such matters cannot be defined unilaterally by the military; they require dialogue and transparency to help avoid future disputes,” further stressed the Troika and EU.

Following the fall of the al-Bashir regime, the international community formed the Friends of Sudan groups and provided significant economic and financial support to the Sudan as the country was impoverished by corruption and international isolation.

After the coup of October 25, 2021, al-Burhan and his deputy continued to reach out to the international community fearing targeted sanctions on the army’s economic activities and personal businesses of the Rapid Support Forces leader.

The statement reiterated support for the tripartite facilitation panel of the United Nations, African Union, and IGAD which supports the intra-Sudanese dialogue.

“The Troika and the European Union look forward to supporting a transitional civilian government that enjoys popular support, reflecting the hope and aspirations we share with the Sudanese people,” concluded the joint statement."

1067106554,20221011,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán launched an official account on Twitter on Monday, and said that following his first day on the platform, the question on his mind was “where is my good friend [Donald Trump]?”

The populist conservative leader has previously focussed his social media output on Facebook, where he has amassed over 1.2 million followers. On Monday, Orbán’s office announced that he had opened up an account on Twitter, with his first post on the social media platform declaring “let’s make some noise”.

On Tuesday morning, Mr Orbán wrote: “After my first day on Twitter, there’s one question on my mind. Where is my good friend, @realDonaldTrump?” using the former American president’s handle prior to his banishment from the major Silicon Valley social media companies last year.

The Hungarian leader, who was re-elected to a fourth consecutive term in April making him the longest serving national leader in the EU, has been a longstanding supporter of Mr Trump, saying in 2016 that his election to the presidency would mark the end of “liberal non-democracy” and an opportunity for the West to free itself from the political correctness that had prevented common sense governance.

The affection was reciprocated from Trump, who went so far as to jokingly describe Orbán as his “twin brother” during a meeting in the White House in 2019.

Speaking before reporters alongside the Hungarian PM, Trump said that Orbán is “probably like me a little bit controversial, but that’s OK. That’s OK. You’ve done a good job. And you’ve kept your country safe.”

Unlike the majority of leaders in the European Union, Orbán has rejected the push towards globalisation and multiculturalism, emphasising instead national identity and the nation’s Christian heritage. The Hungarian leader has also been a major force against mass migration, choosing to focus governmental efforts on supporting families rather than turning to foreign populations to mitigate the Western demographic collapse.

While he has represented a lone voice in Europe on such issues, with the notable exception of Poland, there has been a growing populist pushback in Europe against the EU establishment in Brussels, with the right-wing Sweden Democrats making significant gains in last month’s elections and Brothers of Italy leader Georgia Meloni set to become prime minister of the EU’s third largest nation.

Speaking to Breitbart News earlier this month, Donald Trump said that the conservative victories in Europe represented a “great movement”.

“The whole thing is a great movement that’s taken place and now it’s happening all over the world,” Trump said. “It’s a very simple movement: Give us borders, give us safe streets, we don’t want crime, give us good education, give us dignity and give us respect as a nation. It’s not complicated.”

It remains to be seen if there will be a Twitter reunion for Orbán and Trump. While the acquisition of the Big Tech giant by Tesla CEO Elon Musk perhaps paving the way for Trump to return to the platform, the American president has previously said that he would prefer to focus on his own social media company, Truth Social, and branding Musk as a “bullshit artist“."
1067106557,20221011,"Children of my Gaza refugee camp were rarely afraid of monsters but of Israeli soldiers. This is all that we talked about before going to bed. Unlike imaginary monsters in the closet or under the bed, Israeli soldiers are real, and they could show up any minute — at the door, on the roof or, as was often the case, right in the middle of the house.

The recent tragic death of a 7-year-old, Rayan Suliman, a Palestinian boy from the village of Tuqu near Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank, stirred up so many memories. The little boy with olive skin, innocent face and bright eyes fell on the ground while being chased by Israeli soldiers, who accused him and his peers of throwing stones. He fell unconscious, blood poured out of his mouth and, despite efforts to revive him, he ceased to breathe.

This was the abrupt and tragic end of Rayan’s life. All the things that could have been, all the experiences that he could have lived, and all the love that he could have imparted or received, all ended suddenly, as the boy lay face down on the pavement of a dusty road, in a poor village, without ever experiencing a single moment of being truly free or even safe.

Adults often project their understanding of the world on children. We want to believe that Palestinian children are warriors against oppression, injustice and military occupation. Though Palestinian children develop political consciousness at a very young age, quite often their action of protesting against the Israeli military, chanting against invading soldiers or even throwing stones are not compelled by politics, but by something else entirely: Their fear of monsters.

This connection came to mind when I read the details of the harrowing experience that Rayan and many of the village children endure daily.

Tuqu is a Palestinian village that, once upon a time, existed in an uncontested landscape. In 1957, the illegal Jewish settlement of Tekoa was established on stolen Palestinian land. The nightmare had begun.

Israeli restrictions on Palestinian communities in that area increased, along with land annexation, travel restrictions and deepening apartheid. Several residents, mostly children from the village, were injured or killed by Israeli soldiers during repeated protests: The villagers wanted to have their life and freedom back; the soldiers wanted to ensure the continued oppression of Tuqu in the name of safeguarding the security of Tekoa. In 2017, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy, Hassan Mohammad Al Amour, was shot and killed during a protest; in 2019, another, Osama Hajahjeh, was seriously wounded.

The children of Tuqu had much to fear, and their fears were all well-founded. A daily journey to school, taken by Rayan and many of his peers, accentuated these fears. To get to school, the kids had to cross Israeli military barbed wire, often manned by heavily armed Israeli soldiers.

Sometimes, kids attempted to avoid the barbed wire so as to avoid the terrifying encounter. The soldiers anticipated this. “We tried to walk through the olive field next to the path, instead, but the soldiers hide in the trees there and grab us,” a 10-year-old boy from Tuqu, Mohammed Sabah, was quoted in an article by Sheren Khalel, published years ago.

The nightmare has been ongoing for years, and Rayan experienced that terrorising journey for over a year, of soldiers waiting behind barbed wires, of mysterious creatures hiding behind trees, of hands grabbing little bodies, of children screaming for their parents, beseeching God and running in all directions.

Following Rayan’s death on September 29, the US State Department, the British government and the European Union demanded an investigation, as if the reason why the little boy succumbing to his paralysing fears was a mystery, as if the horror of Israeli military occupation and violence was not an everyday reality.

Rayan’s story, though tragic beyond words, is not unique but a repeat of other stories experienced by countless Palestinian children.

When Ahmad Manasra was run over by an Israeli settler’s car, and his cousin, Hassan, was killed in 2015, Israeli media and apologists fanned the flames of propaganda, claiming that Manasra, 13 at the time, was a representation of something bigger. Israel claimed that Manasra was shot for attempting to stab an Israeli guard, and that such action reflected deep-seated Palestinian hatred for Israeli Jews, another convenient proof of the indoctrination of Palestinian children by their supposedly violent culture. Despite his injuries and young age, Manasra was tried in 2016, and was sentenced to twelve years in prison.

Manasra comes from the Palestinian town of Beit Hanina, near Jerusalem. His story is, in many ways, similar to that of Rayan: A Palestinian town, an illegal Jewish settlement, soldiers, armed settlers, ethnic cleansing, land theft and real monsters, everywhere. None of this mattered to the Israeli court or to mainstream, corporate media. They turned a 13-year-old boy into a monster, instead, and used his image as a poster child of Palestinian terrorism taught at a very young age.

The truth is, Palestinian children throw stones at Israeli soldiers, neither because of their supposedly inherent hatred of Israelis, nor as purely political acts. They do so because it is their only way of facing their own fears and coming to terms with their daily humiliation.

Just before Rayan managed to escape the crowd of Israeli soldiers and was chased to his death, an exchange took place between his father and the soldiers. Rayan’s father told the Associated Press the soldiers had threatened that, if Rayan was not handed over, they would return at night to arrest him along with his older brothers, aged 8 and 10. For a Palestinian child, a nightly raid by Israeli soldiers is the most terrifying prospect. Rayan’s young heart could not bear the thought. He fell unconscious.

Doctors at the nearby Palestinian hospital of Beit Jala had a convincing medical explanation of why Rayan has died. A pediatric specialist spoke about increased stress levels, caused by “excess adrenaline secretion” and increased heartbeats, leading to a cardiac arrest. For Rayan, his brothers and many Palestinian children, the culprit is something else: The monsters who return at night and terrify the sleeping children.

Chances are, Rayan’s older brothers will be back in the streets of Tuqu, stones and slingshots in hand, ready to face their fears of monsters, even if they pay the price with their own lives.

1067111902,20221011,"THE political issues may be combustible, but few rhetorical fireworks went off on Tuesday as the UK Supreme Court began its two-day oral hearing on whether the Scottish Parliament has the legislative competence to hold its own referendum on Scottish independence.

Viewers who tuned in expecting to hear evidence and witnesses and cross-examination, or lawyers arguing about the right of self-determination in international law, or reflection of the significance of the Claim of Right – 1689 or 1989 – were destined to be disappointed.

Because this case turns not on these principles, but the approach Lord Reed and his four colleagues take to the construction of the Scotland Act 1998 and its complex and often convoluted system of devolved and reserved powers.

READ MORE: LIVE from the Supreme Court for the independence referendum legal battle

The legal issues are technical, but boil down to two key issues: Does Holyrood have the power to legislate for an independence referendum, and should the court decide this issue now? The Lord Advocate argues they should.

The Scottish Government has produced a draft independence Referendum Bill. Kicking off proceedings, Dorothy Bain KC asked the Court to decide whether or not this draft bill falls within Holyrood’s legislative competence. The Scotland Act gives her the power to refer “devolution issues” to the court for resolution. But is this a “devolution issue”?

The Lord Advocate persuasively argued this isn’t an “abstract” or academic legal argument. “It is,” she said “a live issue” and the court has the opportunity to “provide certainty and clarity to the Scottish Government, Parliament and public” about whether the structures of devolution allow the Parliament’s pro-independence majority to honour the manifesto commitments which returned them to Holyrood in May last year.

The main thrust of her submissions was that the uncertainty is damaging, and the court can in good conscience eliminate that now. She pointed to a lack of academic consensus about whether Holyrood has competence or not. She pointed out that even if the Scottish Government Bill is stymied, there’s every likelihood a pro-independence backbencher would push a proposal to a vote, and it is only a matter of time before the court had to reconvene to determine the question.

What does the UK Government argue?





The UK Government – represented in court by Treasury Devil Sir James Eadie KC – argue that the Supreme Court doesn’t owe the Lord Advocate an answer to this question. Or at least: Not today. They contend that the proper course is for Holyrood to pass a Referendum Bill – and then and only then, should the Supreme Court have its say.

Their argument, essentially, is “not today, milord.” The courts don’t give advisory opinions – not even to law officers who find themselves in the awkward situation of being unsure whether or not to sign-off a bill.

Dorothy Bain disagrees. It isn’t her job she says to be the “arbiter” or what Holyrood can and cannot do. “It is not constitutionally appropriate that a Lord Officer exercise such a function,” she said. But the court can make that call. Bain argues that in the name of “legal certainty, it is the responsible course and in the public interest” to resolve the issue one way or the other. Essentially: Why kick the can down the road?

On the merits, the Lord Advocate’s case rests on the distinction between “self-executing” and “advisory” referendums. If Holyrood stages a referendum in October next year, what is its purpose and effect? Bain argues that its objective purpose is simply to ask the people of Scotland what they think about their system of government.

If a second independence referendum is held, it will not unilaterally break up Britain any more than the Brexit vote in 2016 resulted in the UK’s immediate departure from the European Union. Not a clause of law will change as a consequence. The Supreme Court is a court of law: not a court of politics or political consequences. Judges should focus on the legal effect of the proposed referendum bill, and not its unforeseen and unforeseeable consequences in the changeable world of politics.

Already at this stage, one thing is clear: Don’t expect an early resolution of these legal issues. On Sunday, retired Supreme Court judge Lord Hope speculated that the final judgment may be handed down in six to eight weeks. Opening the hearing, the current President of the Court poured cold water on that timetable. “It is likely to be some months before we give our judgment,” Lord Reed said, stressing that the two days of argument for and against are just the “tip of the iceberg” of material the five justices have been asked to consider. Arguments continue tomorrow, as the UK Government develops its case."
1067126707,20221011,"DUBAI — Clashes between protesters and security forces persisted across Iran on Tuesday, with social media videos showing tanks being transported to Kurdish areas, which have been a focal point of the crackdown on protests over Mahsa Amini’s death in custody.

Protests calling for the fall of the clerical establishment have swept Iran since Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, died on September 16 while being detained by the morality police in Tehran for “inappropriate attire.”

While observers do not believe the unrest, now in its fourth week, is close to toppling the government, the protests mark one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution, with reports of strikes spreading to the vital energy sector.

The authorities are waging a deadly crackdown. Videos on social media showed trucks moving dark green tanks to Kurdish areas, raising the stakes in the revolt. Reuters could not verify the video footage.

Tensions have been especially high in Kurdish regions, given Amini’s ethnic background. Human rights groups say Iran’s Kurdish minority of more than 10 million has long been oppressed – a charge the Islamic Republic denies.

The Hengaw human rights group reported “intense conflict” on Tuesday between protesters and security forces in three cities in Kurdistan province: Sanandaj, Baneh and Saqez, where Amini was buried last month.

Protesters in Saqez set fire to a statue of local members of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, Hengaw said.

In video footage shared on the widely followed Twitter account group Tavsir1500 from Sanandaj, shooting could be heard and women screaming. Reuters could not independently verify the footage from Hengaw or Tasvir1500.

At least 185 people, including 19 minors, have been killed, hundreds injured and thousands have been arrested by the security forces, according to rights groups. The government says more than 20 members of the security forces have been killed.

Iranian authorities have said they will investigate civilian deaths.

They have blamed the violence on an array of enemies, including armed Iranian Kurdish dissidents, with the Revolutionary Guards attacking their bases in neighboring Iraq a number of times during the latest unrest.

Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi reiterated accusations that Iranian Kurdish dissident groups were supporting the protests and said security forces would “neutralize the desperate anti-revolutionary effort.”

Energy installations in southwest Iran were hit by strikes for a second day on Tuesday, with workers protesting at the Abadan oil refinery, Kangan, and the Bushehr petrochemical plant, according to the Tavsir1500 Twitter account.

Videos posted on the account showed a few dozen workers chanting “Death to the dictator,” referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

A regional official said the workers at the Assaluye plant were angered by a dispute over wages and were not protesting over Amini’s death.

Governor Ali Hashemi said some Iranians had tried to hijack the workers’ protests by chanting anti-government slogans, according to Iran’s Young Journalists Club News Telegram account.

It was a combination of mass protests and strikes by oil workers and bazaar merchants that helped to propel the Shi’ite clergy to power in the Iranian revolution four decades ago.

Dozens of universities are also currently on strike, with students playing a pivotal role in the protests.

In several neighborhoods of Tehran, such as Shahrak’e Gharb and Narmak, witnesses said people chanted “Death to Khamenei” from rooftops after nightfall. Videos on social media showed demonstrations in the cities of Isfahan and Qom with protesters cursing and throwing stones at security forces.

The authorities’ crackdown on protesters has prompted some Western states to draw up more sanctions on Iran, stoking diplomatic tensions at a time when talks to revive Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers are at a standstill.

France’s foreign minister said on Tuesday, five of its nationals were being held in Iran and the European Union had agreed the technical aspects to impose sanctions on Tehran, which would come into force next week.

France lashed out at Iran on October 6, accusing it of “dictatorial practices” and taking its citizens hostage after a video was aired in which a French couple appeared to confess to spying.

1067128201,20221011,"National and supranational legislatures continue to develop laws requiring employers to conduct due diligence of their operations and those of their business partners in order to address human rights risks such as forced labor and child labor. Recently, the European Union (EU), Switzerland, and Japan have rolled out such laws, described below:

In October 2021, we reported on the EU’s Draft Directive on Corporate Due Diligence and Corporate Accountability (the “Draft Directive”). At that time, the Draft Directive was being reviewed by the European Commission. Based on the Draft Directive, on February 23, 2022, the European Commission adopted proposed legislation on corporate sustainability due diligence (the “Directive”).

The Directive is now working its way through the European Parliament, subject to amendments. Essentially, the Directive places substantive obligations on companies to identify, prevent and remedy adverse human rights and environmental risks in companies’ “value chains.”1

To Which Companies Does the Directive Apply?

Notably, the Directive will apply to certain companies formed both (1) within the EU, and (2) outside the EU but operating in the EU.

(1) For a company that is formed within the EU, the Directive will apply if it also meets one of the following criteria:
• Had more than 500 employees on average and a net worldwide turnover of €150 million, in the last financial year for which financial statements have been prepared; or
• Did not meet the thresholds outlined in a), but had more than 250 employees on average, and had a net turnover of more than €40 million in the last financial year for which annual financial statements have been prepared, with at least 50% of the net turnover generated in one or more of the following sectors:
• Manufacture of textiles, leather and related products (including footwear), and the wholesale trade of textiles, clothing and footwear;
• Agriculture, forestry, fisheries (including aquaculture), the manufacture of food products, and the wholesale trade of agricultural raw materials, live animals, wood, food, and beverages;
• Extraction of mineral resources, the manufacture of basic metal products, other non-metallic mineral products and fabricated metal products (except machinery and equipment), and the wholesale trade of mineral resources, basic and intermediate mineral products (including metals and metal ores, construction materials, fuels, chemicals and other intermediate products).

(2) For a company that is formed outside the EU, the Directive will apply if it also meets one of the following criteria:
• Generated a net turnover of more than €150 million in the EU in the financial year preceding the last financial year; or
• Generated a net turnover of more than €40 million but less than €150 million in the EU in the financial year preceding the last financial year, provided that at least 50% of its net worldwide turnover was generated in one or more of the sectors listed above.2

What Specific Obligations Are Placed on Companies?

The Directive places obligations on Member States to ensure that companies conduct human rights and environmental due diligence by carrying out a number of actions, including:3
• Integrating due diligence into their corporate policies, and to have in place a due diligence policy (updated and published annually) containing a description of the company’s approach to due diligence (including in the long term), a code of conduct for employees and subsidiaries, and a description of the processes in place to implement due diligence;
• Identifying actual or potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts arising out of their own operations or those of their subsidiaries, and where related to their value chains, from their established business relationships;
• Preventing and minimizing potential adverse impacts and bringing actual adverse impacts to an end and mitigating their extent. The Directive sets out of number of actions companies should take to this extent. For example, such actions may include seeking contractual assurances from business partners to ensure their compliance with the company’s code of conduct, and so on through the value chain; or to suspend or terminate commercial or business relationships with partners in their value chain in connection with adverse impacts that have arisen, as permitted by governing law;
• Monitoring the effectiveness of their due diligence policy and measures; and
• Publicly communicating on due diligence by publishing an annual statement on their website.

What Will Be the Consequences for Non-Compliance?

The Directive requires Member States to establish sanctions for non-compliance with the national provisions adopted in accordance with the Directive, and will leave it to Member States to determine the rules governing such sanctions.4 When determining whether to impose sanctions and to what extent, due account must be given to the company’s efforts to comply with any remedial action required of them by a supervisory authority (a Member State designee charged with the supervision of compliance with the obligations laid down in the national provisions adopted pursuant to the Directive), any investments made and any targeted support provided pursuant to the requirement to prevent potential adverse impacts and to end actual adverse impacts, as well as collaboration with other entities to address adverse impacts in its value chains, as applicable.

Furthermore, the Directive also requires that Member States make civil liability mechanisms available to find companies liable for damages where they have failed to comply with their obligations to prevent potential adverse impacts, and to end actual adverse impacts, and where, as a result of this failure, the adverse impact that should have been identified, prevented, minimized, brought to an end, or its extent mitigated, occurred and led to damage.5

When Will the Directive Come into Force?

There is no set date for the Directive to come into force, particularly as it is not yet in its final form. It must work its way through the EU Parliament, and then passed to the EU Council.

Once finalized and entered into force, Member States will have two years to transpose the Directive into their local law.6 The provisions of the local law will apply to the companies outlined in 1(a) and 2(a) above two years from the entry into force of the Directive, and to the companies outlined in 1(b) and 2(b) above four years from the entry into force of the Directive.7

Update on Other Human Rights Due Diligence and Transparency Mandates:

Norway’s “Act Relating to Enterprises’ Transparency and Work on Fundamental Human Rights and Decent Working Conditions”

While the EU Directive is still being debated and finalized, many EU countries have, for years, been developing and implementing their own corporate human rights due diligence and transparency obligations.8 One country that has done so recently is Norway.

On July 1, 2022, Norway’s Act relating to enterprises’ transparency and work on fundamental human rights and decent working conditions was entered into force (the “Norwegian Act”). More information about the obligations imposed on companies under the Norwegian Act is outlined in our previous Insight.

While still under review, The Responsible Sustainable International Business Conduct Act (the “Dutch Act”) is proposed to enter into force on January 1, 2023 (with the exception of Sections 3.2 to 3.6 (provisions in relation to supervision and enforcement),9 which are intended to enter into force at later dates).

What Specific Obligations are Placed on Companies?

The Dutch Act imposes a duty of care applicable to every “enterprise”10 that knows, or can reasonably suspect, that its activities may have negative impacts on human rights, labor rights, or the environment on countries outside of the Netherlands. All enterprises must (a) take all measures reasonably required to prevent such impacts; (b) to the extent such impacts are not preventable, mitigate or reverse them to the extent possible and, where necessary, enable remediation; and (c) to the extent that such impacts cannot be limited sufficiently, refrain from the relevant activity, insofar as may reasonably be expected from the enterprise.

Certain enterprises (which meet the criteria outlined below) must adhere to additional due diligence obligations, including:
• Publishing and implementing a policy document that outlines the enterprise’s commitment to the obligation of due diligence in their value chain(s), and the enterprise’s due diligence plan.
• Conducting a risk analysis and developing an action plan to prevent, mitigate and address potential and actual negative impacts.
• Ceasing activities that cause or contribute to negative impacts on human rights, labor rights, or the environment.
• Monitoring the application and results of due diligence measures.
• Reporting annually on the due diligence policy and measures.
• Ensuring an appropriate remediation mechanism is in place, and remediation (or contribution to remediation) of negative impacts caused (or contributed to) by the enterprise.11

These obligations apply only to enterprises that (a) engage in activities outside of the Netherlands, and (b) exceed at least two of the three following criteria on their balance sheet date: (i) balance sheet total of €20 million; (ii) net revenue of €40 million; or (iii) an average of 250 employees during the financial year.

While the EU and a number of its Member States are developing their own approaches to human rights due diligence, transparency, and corporate social responsibility, other countries are also doing the same. Two of the most recent jurisdictions to do so are Switzerland and Japan.

In January 2022, the Swiss Code of Obligations (“CO”) was amended to introduce two new categories of corporate human rights reporting obligations: (1) annual reporting obligations on “non-financial matters,” including environmental matters, CO goals, social issues, employee-related issues, respect for human rights, and combating corruption,12 (“Non-Financial Reporting Obligations”) and (2) supply chain and reporting obligations with respect to minerals and metals from conflict-affected areas and child labor (“Conflict Area and Child Labor Reporting Obligations”).

To Which Companies Do the Non-Financial Reporting Obligations Apply?
• Companies of “public interest” (as defined in Article 2 letter c of the Auditor Oversight Act of 16 December 2005);13
• the Swiss or foreign companies that they control with at least 500 full-time equivalent positions on average over two successive financial years; and
• the Swiss or foreign companies that they control that exceed (a) a balance sheet total of 20 million francs, and/or (b) sales revenue of 40 million francs, in two successive financial years.

These reporting obligations do not apply to companies controlled by another company that is a company of “public interest,” or that must prepare an equivalent report under foreign law.14

What are the Specific Non-Financial Reporting Obligations Placed on Companies?

The report on non-financial matters must cover the above-aforementioned topics, and contain the information required to understand the business performance, the business result, the state of the company and the effects of its activity on the non-financial matters. In particular, the report must include:
• A description of the policies adopted in relation to the matters referred to in paragraph 1, including the due diligence applied;
• A presentation of the measures taken to implement these policies and an assessment of the effectiveness of these measures;
• A description of the main risks related to the matters referred to in paragraph 1, and how the company is dealing with these risks; in particular, the risks (a) that arise from the company’s own business operations; and (b) provided this is relevant and proportionate, that arise from its business relationships, products or services; and
• The main performance indicators for the company’s activities in relation to the matters referred to in paragraph 1.15

The report must be published online and remain publicly accessible for at least 10 years.16

To Which Companies Do the Conflict Area and Child Labor Reporting Obligations Apply?

Companies whose seat, head office or principal place of business is located in Switzerland must comply with obligations of due diligence in the supply chain and report on this if (a) they place in free circulation or process in Switzerland minerals containing tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold or metals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas; or (b) they offer products or services in relation to which there is a reasonable suspicion that they have been manufactured or provided using child labor.17

What Are the Specific Conflict Area and Child Labor Reporting Obligations Placed on Companies?

Companies must maintain a management system, which must stipulate the following:
• The supply chain policy for minerals and metals that potentially originate from conflict-affected and high-risk areas;
• The supply chain policy for products or services in relation to which there is a reasonable suspicion of child labor; and
• A system by which the supply chain can be traced.

Companies are required to identify and assess the risks of harmful impacts in their supply chain(s), and develop a risk-management plan and take measures to minimize the risks identified. Compliance with the due diligence obligations in relation to minerals and metals must be audited by an independent specialist.18

Companies are required to prepare an annual report on compliance with due diligence obligations. The report must be published online within six months of the end of the financial year and remain publicly accessible for at least 10 years.19

Japan’s Draft Guidelines on Respect for Human Rights in Responsible Supply Chains

Partly influenced by the EU Directive that will apply to certain non-EU companies, the Japanese government has also published guidelines for companies to detect and prevent human rights violations in their supply chains.

Japan’s “Guidelines for Respect for Human Rights in Responsible Supply Chains” (the “Guidelines”) are not legally binding, but are presented as guidance to all business enterprises, regardless of size or sector, engaging in business activities in Japan. Under the Guidelines, business enterprises are urged to establish a human rights policy, conduct human rights due diligence (based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) and provide a remedy when business enterprises cause or contribute to adverse human rights impacts.20

These legislative developments add to the clear trend towards the global development of legislation addressing corporate human rights due diligence and disclosure obligations. As these developments increase in number, multinational employers should take stock of their global operations, and identify areas in those operations where there is a high risk of human rights violations, including forced labor and other modern slavery practices. Where such risks are identified, those employers should take appropriate action to address those risks and implement procedures to ensure that new and existing relationships remain free of such activities. Because this due diligence process can be complex, it is recommended that employers engage the expertise of experienced counsel."
