1141495972,20231114,"Last week, more than 40 of nearly 80 third world or developing nations signed on to the new economic partnership agreement between the European Union and its former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP). However, a number of Caribbean and African nations have backed away from signing for now because of concerns about the EU imposing some controversial western values on these countries.

The new Samoa Agreement replaces the Cotonou Agreement that the two groups had signed back in 2000 and basically governs aid and trade arrangements between Europe and countries which it had formerly colonized.

A number of social and academic activists in the Caribbean in particular, have railed against the news deal, urging governments not to sign the documents because of concerns that references to human and other rights in the agreements will eventually force the region to amend domestic legislation allowing for same sex marriages, the introduction of sex education in state schools, and related issues. EU and ACP officials who had worked on the documents during months of negotiations leading up to the signing in Samoa last week, say there are no such references in the agreement and activists are reading way too much into the various clauses without justification.

Nonetheless, Jamaica, Trinidad, Antigua, St. Lucia, St. Kitts, The Bahamas, Grenada, and Dominica have delayed signing the deal, with authorities in Jamaica and Trinidad in particular being urged by civil society groups not to sign because such will open the door to Europeans imposing LGBTQ-plus demands like same sex marriages on local societies. Guyana has also not signed because authorities have made a rather strange request for a reservation relating to economic migrants and refugees. Flabbergasted EU and ACP officials say they have nothing to work with from the Caricom head office nation and it is up to Guyana to come on board when ready as they are not even sure what the reservation means and intends. Cuba has also delayed signing but the reason is unknown. Those who have not signed have until mid-next year to do so.

Of those in the Caribbean which have not signed on, Jamaica was among the first to air its objections in public, with at least 15 civil society groups piling on the pressure for Jamaica to refuse to do so. The Andrew Holness government has come under severe pressure from these groups in a country which is globally known to abhor same sex relations especially when it involves men with men.

Announcing the signing delay last week, Foreign Minister Kamina Johnson Smith said this will delay further consultations with domestic groups to ensure no local laws are breached.

“Throughout the negotiations which concluded in 2021, the government had taken on board the views of the various stakeholders, including members of civil society. After what was in fact three years of challenging negotiations, the government was satisfied that the language of the text in the final agreement would not supersede Jamaica’s domestic legislation. Notwithstanding, the government has taken note of concerns which continue to be raised by stakeholders in the domestic space, so we will continue consultations with the aim of providing assurances regarding the government’s unfailing intent to always protect the interest of Jamaica and Jamaicans with the laws of Jamaica as our guide,” Johnson Smith said.

With Jamaica backing away for now, Trinidadian Catholic Archbishop Charles Jason Gordon has also criticized the Samoa agreement, saying its human rights clauses will cause social trouble in the region. “They will have to impose abortion legislation, transgender, LBGTQ, comprehensive sex education, a whole range of values will be imposed because of the signing of that document. The EU is imposing upon us an ideology that is not ours and a value system that is not ours. And if we don’t understand and wake up and smell the coffee quickly we will find ourselves with values, with laws, with expectations and with things being touted as right that has nothing to do with us Caribbean people. Wake up and smell the coffee. It ain’t far away, it is right here. Thank God for that. Our government got wind of it, have seen and understood and they are saying they don’t have enough information to be able to sign. Thank God for that. Jamaica came out clearly and said we are not for sale, “ said Archbishop Gordon, according to the CMC News Agency."
1141496928,20231121,"The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) promises massive dislocation. Conventional cars have twice as many parts as electric vehicles, translating into far fewer assembly hours. Striking for wages and security against Detroit’s ‘Big Three’ car manufacturers, the United Auto Workers trade union claims that the transition endangers 35,000 jobs among its 150,000 members.

Meanwhile, upstart firms, exemplified by Tesla, Rivian and SK On, are hiring non-union workers from outside the established industry, while Ford and its counterparts are building EV and battery plants in right-to-work states outside the United Auto Workers’ purview. On top of these disruptions comes the threat of new competition from Chinese automakers.

The US government wants two-thirds of new cars sold in 2032 to be electric. The European Union is even more ambitious, wanting all new cars sold to be electric from 2035. But neither want to import EVs from China. Yet with generous subsidies, abundant engineering talent, a flair for innovation, a huge domestic market and public support for decarbonisation, China has become the dominant producer of low cost EVs.

In 2022, China produced almost 60 per cent of the world’s EVs — both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In 2023, production it expected to reach 8 million units, or 25 per cent of all cars sold in China compared with 22 per cent in the European Union, just 6 per cent in the United States, and a measly 3 per cent in Japan. Chinese firms also offer 90 different EV brands at prices ranging from US$5000–90,000. The average EV in China cost around €32,000 (US$53,800)in 2022, compared to an average of €56,000 (US$94,100)in Europe.

While imports from China accounted for only 3 per cent of Europe’s EV sales in 2022, UBS expects this figure to reach 20 per cent by 2030. The European Union objects to generous Chinese subsidies for its EV firms and EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis is actively encouraging China to produce EVs for domestic consumption, not exports. In response, China has assailed the protectionist EU policy direction. Whether Dombrovskis would welcome a Chinese EV factory in Europe is unknown, but if so that would contrast with the probable US reaction.

If other countries had no auto industries and if China did not pose a military threat, everyone would welcome cheap Chinese EVs. But in the world as we know it, Chinese EVs are more of a burden than a blessing. This is because large-scale exports put millions of jobs at risk and other countries fear China hovering over the geopolitical landscape.

Globally, the auto industry employs some 14 million workers who manufacture US$3 trillion worth of vehicles annually. The European Union’s industry employs about 2.5 million workers, while the United States, Mexico and Japan each employ about 1 million workers. Jobs outside China are evidently under threat, though China’s own 4 million auto workers are also at risk of losing their jobs.

In 2022, global car exports were worth US$780 billion, more than a quarter of world production. The European Union led the export parade with US$407 billion, followed by Japan with US$87 billion, the United States at US$58 billion, South Korea at US$52 billion and Mexico with US$47 billion. China was ranked in 6th place with US$45 billion worth of exports — roughly 40 per cent of which were Teslas. Still, Chinese exports grew more than 80 per cent in 2022, and that’s just the beginning.

Looking back in time, Western auto firms fear that China could repeat the process by which it became the dominant force in the world steel industry. During Mao Tse Tung’s regime, small backyard furnaces were a bad joke. But Deng Xiaoping’s embrace of market economics, coupled with heavy subsidies, enabled China’s great leap forward in steel production. In 2021, China crushed all its rivals in steel production with 1.03 billion tons of output — a substantial 60 per cent of the world total 1.82 billion tons. The European Union was a distant second with 153 million tons, followed by India with 118 million tons, Japan with 96 million tons and the United States with 86 million tons.

Currently, US auto tariffs are only 2.5 per cent (with the exception of a longstanding 25 per cent tariff on pickup trucks). But former president Donald Trump imposed an additional 25 per cent punitive tariff on all Chinese cars, which has been extended by Joe Biden. EU car tariffs are 10 per cent and Japan’s are zero. Idiosyncratic regulatory standards and vehicle taxes that vary with engine displacement are additional barriers to trade.

Since China’s own tariffs on auto imports range between 15 per cent and 25 per cent, Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Euro-American automaker Stellantis, called for Europe to impose reciprocal tariffs on auto imports from China.

Many countries in the Global South will welcome less expensive Chinese EV brands. But to slow Chinese EV dominance, advanced countries are almost certain to raise existing barriers or impose quotas that limit the Chinese share of the market. EVs could well exemplify the fragmentation of world trade.

1141501939,20231121,"A Palestinian medic cares for premature babies, evacuated from Gaza City's Al Shifa hospital, ahead of their transfer from a hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip to Egypt, on November 20, 2023, amid ongoing battles between Israel and the militant group Hamas. Twenty-nine premature babies arrived in Egypt on November 20, Egyptian media said, after their evacuation from Gaza's largest hospital which has become a focal point of Israel's war with Hamas.

PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES — Twenty-eight premature babies were evacuated from war-devastated Gaza to Egypt on Monday as the Hamas-run health ministry accused Israel of a deadly strike on the territory's Indonesian Hospital.

While fighting raged, negotiators worked to seal a deal for the release of some of the roughly 240 hostages the Islamist militants took during their unprecedented October 7 attacks on Israel.

The Gaza health ministry charged that Israel's army killed at least 12 people in the strike on the Indonesian Hospital in the Palestinian territory's north, where entire city blocks have been reduced to rubble.

Those killed included patients, said Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the ministry.

Hamas authorities have reported a total death toll of more than 13,300, mostly civilians, from the Israel-Hamas war now in its seventh week.

Late Monday, Qudra said about 100 patients had so far been evacuated from the Indonesian Hospital, in coordination with the Red Cross.

Hundreds remained inside but efforts continued to move them to hospitals in southern Gaza, Qudra added.

The military pushed on with its withering air and ground campaign aimed at destroying Hamas in response to the October 7 attacks that officials said killed around 1,200 people, when the militants broke through Gaza's militarised border.

""We are witnessing a killing of civilians that is unparallelled and unprecedented in any conflict since I am Secretary-General,"" said United Nations chief Antonio Guterres.

More than 2.4 million Palestinians are trapped in Gaza and only several hundred war-wounded, foreign nationals and dual passport holders have been allowed out.

On Monday the UN World Health Organization said 28 premature babies evacuated from Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, had been taken to safety in Egypt through the Rafah crossing, revising down by one a number given by Egyptian media.

""All babies are fighting serious infections and continue needing health care,"" the WHO said, while the Israeli army said it had ""helped facilitate"" the transfer.

In Israel's commercial centre, Tel Aviv, the families of Israeli children held hostage by Hamas were among hundreds of people who demonstrated outside the UN children's fund, which they urged to speak out for their release.

Yoni Asher, whose daughters, four-year-old Raz and Aviv, 2, are among the captives, called on UNICEF to make a public stand about Israeli children ""like you refer specifically to babies on the other side"".

Air raid sirens warning of incoming Hamas rockets suddenly interrupted the demonstration, sending some people running for shelter as others flung themselves onto the ground.

US President Joe Biden on Monday said he believes a deal to free hostages in Gaza is close. ""I believe so,"" he said during a White House ceremony.

The Red Cross said its president had travelled to Qatar to meet with Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, and separately with officials in the emirate which has helped broker talks on the hostages.

The bloodiest-ever Gaza war has seen Israeli troops raid, occupy and evacuate Al-Shifa hospital.

Israel, backed by the United States, argues that Hamas has used vast tunnel networks below Al-Shifa for military purposes. It has shown recovered weapons, and on Sunday said it had uncovered a 55-metre tunnel.

It also released CCTV footage it said showed two male hostages being brought into the facility.

The militants and medical staff have denied that a command centre is under the hospital, and Israel has yet to reveal evidence of a major military headquarters below ground.

The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) charity on Monday said on X, formerly Twitter, that its Gaza City clinic had come under fire ""as heavy fighting took place all around it. An Israeli tank was seen in the street.""

Twenty-one people inside are ""in extreme danger"", MSF said.

Alarm has surged over the dire humanitarian situation across Gaza where cold autumn rain has deepened the misery by soaking families living in tents and turning dust to mud.

The WHO warned of spreading sickness with 44,000 cases of diarrhoea and 70,000 acute respiratory infections registered in shelters.

With a majority of Gaza's hospitals no longer functioning, the territory on Monday received from Jordan what Palestinian officials said is the first field hospital since the war began.

It has a 41-bed capacity, the Jordanian royal palace said.

Israel has told Palestinians to move from north Gaza for their safety, but deadly air strikes have continued to hit central and southern areas.

Families walked along cracked roads as gunshots and explosions rang out in the distance.

""It's like the apocalypse,"" said one tearful woman, Renad al-Helou.

""We are tired. There's no water, no food... There's nothing left in Gaza. There's only destruction, suffering and torture.""

On Monday a senior Israeli military official told reporters that if the army wants to take out Hamas's firepower, ""we have to go to the south. We cannot do it without"" going there.

The Gaza war has sparked fears of a wider conflagration in the Middle East where Israel has long faced arch-enemy Iran and its allies.

Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, allied with Hamas, said it targeted troops in northern Israel with drones, artillery and missiles on Monday, claiming a string of new attacks.

In response to missile launches from ""a terrorist cell"", Israel's military said tanks, a fighter jet and a helicopter struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.

Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels on Sunday said they had seized in the Red Sea a cargo ship with links to an Israeli businessman.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the vessel ""was hijacked with Iran guidance by the Yemenite Huthi militia"", an allegation Iran rejected.

During a meeting with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Monday, Jordan's King Abdullah II called for a ceasefire in Gaza and an ""end to the siege"".

He warned of the ""catastrophic effects of the ongoing heinous war, which is killing innocent, defenceless civilians"", as well as rising settler violence in the occupied West Bank.

Israel has refused to heed calls for a ceasefire before Hamas releases all the hostages.

South Africa, long a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, will on Tuesday host a virtual summit of the BRICS group of nations to discuss the Israel-Hamas war.

On the eve of the event Israel's foreign ministry said it had recalled for consultations its ambassador to Pretoria."

1141509353,20231114,"In June 2006, U.S. Senator Dick Durban (D. Ill) was asked what the Democrats’ plan was for addressing the threat posed by Iran, even then recognized by the international community as the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism. “I really don’t know,” Durban sighed. “With any luck Israel will take care of it, and then we can all blame Israel.”

The parlor game played in Western capitals of looking privately to Israel to do necessary things and then publicly blaming it for doing so has come recently to mind, as some recite how important it is that Hamas be defeated while criticizing Israel for attempting the difficult job of defeating it. The European Parliament recently voted 500 to 21 in support of a resolution affirming “that the terrorist organization Hamas needs to be eliminated.” Last week the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrell, told a Bahrain conference “Hamas cannot be in control anymore.”

This, of course, is obvious. But here’s the thing: who’s going to eliminate Hamas? Who’s going to ensure that Hamas isn’t in control of Gaza anymore?

The answer is also obvious: it is either going to be Israel or it is going to be nobody. And with all due respect to the pablum-dispensers who go on television to mouth the mantra that “Of course, Israel has the right to defend itself, but….”, Hamas will in fact remain in control of Gaza and will continue to crush Palestinians and murder Israelis unless Israel finishes the job it has started. Going on MSNBC and offering up the meaningless drivel that “Israel is going to have to find a way to eliminate Hamas that doesn’t harm civilians” is the intellectual equivalent of peddling cotton candy, all fluff and no substance.

The political attacks on Israel may be inane, but there is so much inanity that it’s sometimes hard to keep track of it all. One particularly vapid formulation in vogue in recent days and increasingly common among Democratic congressmen fearful of being primaried from the Left next year, is that there should be a ceasefire and Hamas should be gone from Gaza. It sounds great, and it is also patently ridiculous. How, precisely, is Hamas to be removed if there is a ceasefire?

Answer: It can’t be, and it won’t be. It takes no Einstein to comprehend that a ceasefire is a license to Hamas to reconstitute, as it has before, to continue repressing Palestinians and to continue murdering Israelis. So you can have a ceasefire, or you can remove Hamas, but you can’t have both, and those calling for both do a very fine job of looking witless.

Then there’s the line that Israel should back down because otherwise it will generate “more hate.” Really? On Oct. 7 Hamas sent 3,000 murderers into Israel and slaughtered 1,200 Israeli innocents, gleefully decapitating, dismembering, burning, mutilating, shredding and raping human beings, while kidnapping 240 others and bringing them back into Gaza. There Gazans paraded disfigured Israeli bodies around the street and jubilantly celebrated en masse. Is the argument that if Israel tries to prevent this from recurring it may make Gazans hateful?

That leaves the argument that “the number of civilian deaths is unacceptable.” But what exactly does that mean? Every civilian death is “unacceptable.” No civilian death is “acceptable.” But where Hamas purposefully operates from sophisticated tunnels underneath hospitals, mosques, apartments and schools, and from within those structures, there simply is no way of attacking Hamas without killing civilians, no matter how careful Israel is – because that, giving its middle finger to the civilized world, is how Hamas functions. If Israel’s critics have some magic method of eliminating Hamas, or even protecting Israelis from another mass slaughter, without harming civilians, those critics should by all means share their wisdom with the Israel Defense Forces post haste.

In the meantime, a ceasefire with Hamas means capitulation to Hamas. Which means that Israel has no other choice but to finish the job it has started.

1141510099,20231121,"SEOUL, Nov. 21 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's exports rose 2.2 percent on-year in the first 20 days of this month on growing demand for semiconductors and vehicles, data showed Tuesday.

Outbound shipments reached US$33.79 billion in the Nov. 1-20 period, compared with $33.07 billion tallied a year earlier, according to the data from the Korea Customs Service.

Per-day exports also went up 2.2 percent on-year to $2.18 billion during the cited period, it added.

Exports grew for the first time in 13 months in October. They advanced 5.1 percent on-year to US$55 billion, driven by rising chip sales in the global market.

Imports fell 6.2 percent on-year to $35.21 billion during the first 20 days of November, resulting in a trade deficit of $1.4 billion.



The growth in exports was led by upbeat global sales of South Korean semiconductors and vehicles.

Exports of semiconductors, a key export item, advanced 2.4 percent to $5.41 billion during the first 20 days of this month.

It marked the first time since September last year that chip exports logged on-year growth during the first 20 days of a month.

On a monthly basis, semiconductor exports have fallen for 15 months in a row since August 2022 through October amid the industry downcycle.

Chip exports accounted for 16 percent of the country's total exports.

Shipments of petroleum products inched up 0.4 percent to $3.05 billion, and exports of electronics jumped 25.6 percent to $430 million.

But steel exports fell 9.5 percent on-year to $2.23 billion, and those of auto parts fell 3.6 percent to $1.14 billion.

By destination, exports to China, the top trading partner for South Korea, fell 2.4 percent to $7.23 billion.

Exports to the United States, however, jumped 15.7 percent on-year to $6.59 billion during the cited period, and those to Vietnam climbed 1.4 percent to $3.11 billion.

Exports to the European Union lost 4.1 percent to $3.18 billion, while those to Japan increased 10.8 percent to $1.63 billion.

""Semiconductor sales are forecast to mark on-year growth this month, which would help lead the growth in overall exports,"" an industry ministry official said.

The government has expected exports, the country's key economic growth engine, to bottom out and gradually recover and vowed all-out efforts to support exporters."

1141521848,20231121,"YEREVAN — The European Union and Armenia have signed an agreement on the status of the 27-nation bloc’s mission in the South Caucasus country.

The official signing ceremony took place at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia on Monday.

The agreement was signed by Deputy Foreign Minister Paruyr Hovannisyan and Head of the EU Delegation in Armenia, Ambassador Vassilis Maragos, the Armenian Foreign Ministry said.

Hovannisyan said in early November that progress had been made in terms of fixing the status of the European Union mission (EUMA) in Armenia, and that an agreement on the immunity and privileges of EUMA observers would be signed soon.

“The strengthening and expansion of the EU mission is on Yerevan’s agenda,” the official said then.

In January the European Union approved the establishment of a civilian mission in Armenia. It said that monitors sent by different EU member states would strive to “contribute to stability in the border areas of Armenia, build confidence and human security in conflict-affected areas, and ensure an environment conducive to the normalization efforts between Armenia and Azerbaijan.”

About 100 monitors arrived in Armenia in late February. The mission has a mandate for two years and its operational headquarters is in Armenia.

Canada recently decided to join the mission. Last week EU foreign ministers gave the green light to a proposal to beef up the border-monitoring mission in Armenia. When the measure is submitted to the European Commission it will need to come up with a proposal on how the EUMA can be expanded. The decision of the European Commission, in turn, must be ratified by the 27 EU member states.

The EUMA, which operates from six Forward Operating Bases in Armenia’s four provinces bordering on Azerbaijan, said recently that since its deployment it has carried out more than a thousand patrols along the border."
1141527655,20231121,"European Commission Vice President Dubravka Šuica reflected on challenges facing democracy amid demographic changes in Europe at a Harvard Law School event Thursday.

The talk, which was co-sponsored by the Harvard European Law Association, was part of the “Europe in the World Seminar” — a series of events hosted by the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies whose goal is to provide a forum for discussion of European affairs and global issues.

Šuica, who previously served as a member of the European Parliament, leads the Commission’s work on deliberative democracy and demography. As part of the European Union’s executive branch, the Commission proposes policy and executes decisions made by the European Parliament and European Council.

“Our role is to defend democracy, since it is never a finished product but one that needs to evolve and to be adapted to the realities,” Šuica said during the event.

One of the Commission’s priorities, according to Šuica, is to bridge the “information gap” between politicians and citizens by providing Europeans with opportunities to influence policymaking directly.

“Free and fair elections are crucial, but they are not enough to ensure engagement with citizens and to ensure that they feel well served by democracy,” Šuica said.

As Commission vice president, Šuica led the Conference on the Future of Europe, a yearlong initiative that aimed to provide citizens “a say on how the EU is run and what it does,” according to the Commission’s website.

The Commission convened 800 randomly selected citizens, ranging from 16 to 86 years old, from across the European Union to share their visions for the future.

“I have seen with my own eyes the thirst for democratic participation that so-called ‘ordinary citizens’ have,” Šuica said of the Conference.

According to Šuica, the Commission is focused on creating a “better and more efficient” policymaking process through institutional reforms, including a full transition to qualified majority voting in the European Council.

Currently, foreign and security policy in the Council can pass only with the unanimous agreement of all 27 member states. But most policy areas require the lower threshold of a qualified majority vote — whereby legislation passes with the approval of 55 percent of member states collectively representing at least 65 percent of the total EU population.

“I think we have to be faster in bringing decisions because in the States, if your president signs the bill, tomorrow it’s operational,” Šuica said. “In Europe, you have to go to 27 capitals to see what is their opinion.”

Pointing to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Šuica said imposing sanctions on Russia “was not an easy task” for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had to negotiate a unanimous agreement among 27 EU leaders.

Šuica noted that although “big member states,” including Spain, France, and Germany, support qualified majority voting, smaller members fear it would decrease their voting power — posing a challenge for the reform, which must achieve unanimity to pass.

Along with democratic challenges, Šuica discussed how the Commission is responding to demographic changes throughout Europe.

Following a trend of depopulation in rural regions, Šuica said the Commission developed a long-term plan to make these regions “attractive and prosperous again.”

“People leave villages and go to metropolitan areas because they don’t have infrastructure,” Šuica said. “When I say infrastructure, it’s not only waterways and sewage systems. It’s not only bus stops and the groceries. It is also broadband internet and coverage with 5G.”

In an effort to expand connectivity, the European Commission offers funding to member states to support the rollout of high-speed coverage in remote regions — which Šuica said will create new jobs and incentivize residents to stay in the countryside.

Šuica said she ultimately hopes that with technological advancements, both urban and rural areas will thrive.

“The aspiration is that in a few decades, we will have autonomous electric vehicles carrying people and goods around our clean and unpolluted cities, productive rural areas,” Šuica said. “This should not be viewed as science fiction.”

1141527657,20231121,"France should play a key role within the EU to ensure well-functioning relations between the bloc and China, Chinese President Xi Jinping told French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on Monday where he said China is willing to maintain high-level exchanges with France and welcome its products entering the Chinese market.

Macron’s call with Xi comes amid a busy schedule with international partners. On Sunday, he called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and received former Israeli President Reuven Rivlin at the Elysée Palace on Monday.

“China and the European Union should remain partners for mutually beneficial cooperation,” Xi told Macron, calling on France to play a constructive role within the EU for well-functioning relations between the European Union bloc and China.

China is also willing to maintain high-level exchanges with its French counterpart and to welcome French products entering the Chinese market, Xi added.

Macron responded that foreign companies in the Chinese market should come with fair competition conditions – echoing the several EU companies and countries that have often complained about China’s opaque law on foreign companies.

Xi’s ‘tempting’ words come as China faces an anti-subsidy investigation launched by the European Commission on 4 October, looking into whether China is involved in an alleged illegal subsidisation scheme.

In the call, Macron also expressed “deep concerns” about the Russian-North-Korean military cooperation, which he said could have an impact on Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Macron also called on China to maintain relations with the Ukrainian authorities, despite China’s refusal to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and despite Russia’s withdrawal from two arms treaties, the reiteration of its readiness to use nuclear weapons and its nuclear test in November.

Speaking about the war in the Middle East, the leaders agreed it should not escalate regionally.

The two leaders also discussed the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference COP28, with Xi announcing that China will join the Buildings Breakthrough initiative, which sets a zero-emissions target for the construction sector by 2030.

Xi also reasserted China’s commitment to halt Chinese investment in foreign coal power plants and diminish the use of coal energy in China’s energy mix – with Macron seizing the opportunity to reiterate French know-how in low-carbon emission power plants, notably thanks to nuclear energy.

The two agreed to accelerate tourist and academic exchanges between France and China."

1141535451,20231121,"INTERNATIONAL: The Luxembourg Rail Protocol to the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment is to enter into force in contracting states on March 8 2024, the intergovernmental ratification task force has announced.

The initial contracting states are Luxembourg, Sweden, Spain and Gabon. South Africa and Paraguay may also be included, and several African and European states are expected to adopt the protocol soon.

The Luxembourg Rail Protocol is designed to increase the pool of capital finance available for rolling stock investment by setting out a legal regime for the recognition and enforcement of the rights of lenders, lessors and conditional vendors relating to railway rolling stock. A similar protocol covering the aviation sector has been in operation for some years.

Adoption of the Luxembourg Rail Protocol is promoted by the Rail Working Group, which was established at the request of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) to represent the position of the rail industry relating to implementation. Adoption is supported by multilateral institutions including the European Union, African Union and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, as well as financial institutions, academics, law firms and rolling stock lessors.

’We are very pleased, after many years of hard work with our friends and partners across the rail industry, to see a firm date set for the entry into force of the Rail Protocol’, said Rail Working Group Chair Howard Rosen on November 20.

‘This excellent news is not, however, an invitation for us to rest. Indeed, technical work remains regarding the operation of the international registry. Equally significantly, considerable educational and advocacy work lies ahead for our team, as we encourage more and more nations to adopt this landmark treaty.’"
1141539309,20231121,"The collaborative effort involves aBi Development Ltd, Fresh Handling Uganda Limited, and the Ugandan government in implementing this initiative

Uganda reached a significant milestone with the commencement of a groundbreaking ceremony for a cutting-edge airside solar-powered perishable cargo handling center at Entebbe. Valued at $10 million (Shillings 37.8 billion), this transformative project is spearheaded by the Agriculture Business Initiative (aBi) and funded by the European Union and the Danish Royal Government through DANIDA.

The collaborative effort involves aBi Development Ltd, Fresh Handling Uganda Limited, and the Ugandan government in implementing this initiative. At the ceremony, State Minister for Industries David Bahati, representing the Prime Minister, hailed the facility as a game-changer for the horticulture sector. With a two-acre land donation from the Ugandan government near Entebbe International Airport, the center aims to boost export volumes from under 10,000 metric tons, generating $49 million, to an impressive 25,000 metric tons, fetching $150 million. Moreover, employment opportunities are set to rise from 9,000 to over 30,000.

Sanne Willems, the European Union’s team leader for green transition and private sector, highlighted the EU’s commitment, extending a $45 million support grant to aBi. The aim is to enhance export compliance of horticultural products from Uganda to the EU market. Willems emphasized the significance of improving the quality of both exported and locally consumed produce for the health and well-being of consumers.

Danish Ambassador Signe Winding Albjerg underscored the center’s pivotal role in enhancing Uganda’s agro exports, foreseeing a substantial increase in exports and job creation across the value chain. The emphasis on renewable energy aligns with Uganda’s strategic location in the East African Community, offering a competitive edge in regional markets.

Paul Mwambu, Commissioner in charge of crop inspection and certification at the Ministry of Agriculture, stressed the center’s role in maintaining phytosanitary standards essential for international trade. However, he highlighted the necessity for interventions at the farm and transport levels to ensure consistent quality from production to exit points.

Felix Okoboi from aBi Development Ltd expressed pride in championing green investments, highlighting ongoing efforts to mitigate climate change impacts and drive the green transition in agribusiness. The focus remains on equipping partners with the tools necessary for the green transition and creating new green jobs in Uganda.

Daniel Kiryango, Chairman of the board of directors for Fresh Handling Uganda, emphasized the urgency of the project, addressing existing facility shortcomings that caused delays in exporting fresh produce to Europe. The new center aims to elevate Uganda’s position in the global market.

The facility arrives at a crucial juncture, addressing challenges that led to interceptions of Uganda’s fresh agricultural supplies to the European market. Its implementation aims to bolster Uganda’s compliance with bilateral agreements and solidify its standing in the international horticulture market."
1141537266,20231121,"On Monday, Ukrainian prosecutors declared that they would be looking into allegations of fraud and theft inside the government’s cyber security agency, and soon after, two top cyber defense officials were fired, according to a government official who spoke to reporters.

Leading cabinet member Taras Melnychuk posted on Telegram, announcing that the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) chief, Yurii Shchyhol, and his deputy, Viktor Zhora, were both fired from their government positions.

The cabinet’s delegate to parliament, Melnychuk, omitted to disclose the grounds behind the terminations. Protecting the state from cyberattacks and safeguarding government communications are the responsibilities of the SSSCIP.

Less than an hour had passed before anti-corruption prosecutors declared that they were looking into the head and deputy head of the SSSCIP for their suspected participation in a six-person scheme to steal 62 million UAH ($1.72 million) between 2020 and 2022. This was when news of the firings broke to the press.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine stated that authorities believe the officials purchased software at a premium price from two businesses that were allegedly under their control in a bid that was closed to outside bidders.

However, the SSSCIP claimed in a Telegram post that all agency purchases had been done properly and that it was working with investigators.

As the country seeks membership in the European Union (EU), Ukraine has increased its efforts to combat corruption, making this a crucial need before serious discussions can commence.

An unnamed billionaire who formerly supported President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the previous chairman of Ukraine’s Supreme Court have also both been the subject of investigations recently. However, each has refuted any misconduct. The billionaire’s identity was not disclosed to the press.

Shchyhol claimed in a Reuters article in September that “Russian spies are employing hackers to target law enforcement organizations’ computer systems” in order to find and gather information linked to suspected war crimes committed by Russia.

1141541176,20231121,"Cyprus is prepared to initiate the shipment of substantial humanitarian aid to Gaza through shallow-water vessels once conditions permit, President Nikos Christodoulides told Associated Press on Monday.

The proposed maritime corridor spans approximately 230 miles (370 kilometers) from Cyprus’ port of Larnaca to Gaza.

President Christodoulides emphasized that this proposal is the only one currently under international discussion to enhance the limited aid entering Gaza via Egypt’s Rafah border checkpoint.

Planning for the corridor is nearly complete, and aid shipments can commence upon a declared pause in fighting, the president stated.

The complex negotiations for approval involve ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza.

“What do we want? We want everything to be in place so when the situation on the ground allows for it, we can start,” the president noted.

President Christodoulides highlighted broad support for the initiative from the European Union and the United States.

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat expressed Israel’s favor for the project, adding that relevant Israeli ministries and agencies are exploring it.

The aid delivery plan involves shallow-draft vessels initially, with Cyprus coordinating with Gulf countries capable of dispatching such ships.

In the medium term, a floating dock off Gaza is envisioned, and in the long term, the construction of a Gaza port is proposed.

The port of Larnaca’s proximity to the main airport and a U.S.-funded facility for port and maritime security enhances the aid logistics.

The aid, comprising medicine, food, clothing, and essentials, will be continuously transported to Gaza but will function as a one-way corridor. Palestinians will not be allowed to use the ships to exit Gaza.

The aid distribution in Gaza will be managed by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees through its established network, President Christodoulides affirmed."
1141549441,20231121,"The Niger Republic has carried out a withdrawal of its troops from the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) at the border with Nigeria – an action which suggests that it is no longer actively contributing to the regional efforts to curtail the Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists.

The withdrawal by Niger Republic was due to financial sanctions on the country under military leadership by the European Union, African Union, the United Kingdom governments as well as other donor organisations.

Sources familiar with the development told DailyTrust that “The sanctions had affected their (Sector 4) operations. The EU provides the funding so due to the sanctions the EU will not be able to pay the Niger contingent.

“Also, when they are deployed the MNJTF helicopter goes to Niger to pick them to Ndajemena but due to the sanctions, they cannot go and pick them up. Even if they come, the EU won’t be paying.

“So officially, MNJTF have not withdrawn from the frontline, and at the same time, there is little they could do because their funding was cut off by the EU. The problem has to do with sanctions.”

“When commanders finish their tour of duty at the MNJTF, Niger may not be able to deploy another commander because MNJTF cannot go to Niger to pick them and even if they do, no funding due to sanctions,” another source explained.

Recall that the major financial partners of the multinational joint task force, EU, UK, AU, and ECOWAS have announced several sanctions on Niger, cutting financial support following the military take over.

The Sanctions meant to mount pressure on the military government includes freezing of Assets, fund restrictions, shutting down of borders, suspension of imports and exports, power supply cuts and the shutting down of the West Africa’s regional central bank, BCEAO among others.

In separate reactions, the Spokesman of the multinational joint task force, Abubakar Abdullahi and Director, Defence Media Operations, Edward Buba, both denied the withdrawal of Niger from MNJTF.

“Note that, Niger is responsible for Sector 4 of the MNJTF that is located in Diffa. The communication channel between the Sector and HQ MNJTF has been less than perfect. This is obviously, due to the political situation,” Buba told Daily Trust Sunday.

The senior military officer, however, noted that the Defence Headquarters was hoping that things would improve as tension continues to calm down."

1141558933,20231121,"His first job was in London's financial district

Now 59 years old, Mr Farage was born in Kent, attended the private Dulwich College and started working in the City - London's finance district - in 1982. He joined the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), which campaigned to leave the European Union, in 1993. He has four children - two sons with his ex-wife and two daughters with Kirsten Mehr, a German national he reportedly met in 1996.

He led a political party but has never been an MP

Fellow jungle campmate Josie Gibson told Jamie Lynn Spears that Mr Farage was a Member of Parliament in Britain, but this isn't true. He was the leader of UKIP and tried to get elected several times but never succeeded. However, he did get elected to the European Parliament in 1999, and stayed there until 2020. On the day of the 2010 UK general election he survived a plane crash and spent two days in hospital.

He's had a big influence on politics and Brexit

Mr Farage built his political career on being a Eurosceptic - someone who wanted Britain out of the European Union - and it's thought he played a part in making immigration one of the main themes of the debate leading up to the 2016 referendum. He was heavily criticised by opponents for some of the things he said and did, especially a campaign poster showing a line of asylum seekers with the words ""Breaking Point"" on it.

Mr Farage has been criticised for comments on issues including migration, climate change and HIV treatment. He's been forced to deny accusations of racism throughout his political career, but his supporters say that he speaks for working-class voters and people who are unhappy with the stance that the British Conservative and Labour parties take on certain issues.

He won a battle over his bank account

Mr Farage attacked the exclusive Coutts Bank when he got hold of documents suggesting it had closed his account because of his political views. The BBC also had to apologise for reporting - based on information provided by the bank's boss - that Mr Farage did not have enough money to qualify as a Coutts customer.

His I'm a Celebrity appearance has been controversial

The announcement Mr Farage would be on I'm a Celebrity and reports he'd earn £1.5m for it made plenty of people angry, and the hashtag BoycottImaCeleb trended around the first episode. The show's opening had two million fewer viewers this year versus 2022. High-profile ITV2 show Love Island, which aired in the summer and definitely did not feature Mr Farage, also lost one million viewers this year.

1141558936,20231121,"Researchers analysed how daily versus weekly data can underestimate excess deaths due to heat-related mortality.

High temperatures in 2022 may be responsible for 70,000 excess deaths in Europe, according to a new study.

Researchers at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) revised initial estimates of heat-related mortality for summer 2022 in a new analysis published in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe journal.

According to Copernicus, the EU’s earth observation programme, 2022 was the second hottest year on record in Europe. It was around 0.9 C above average, with summer temperatures in Europe at 1.4 C above average.

ISGlobal and Inserm scientists previously had estimated that more than 61,000 people died in the 2022 summer heatwaves with Italy the EU country most impacted. They have revised their estimate after developing a new framework for measuring heat-related mortality.

The new framework was based on daily temperatures and mortality records from 147 regions in 16 European countries and allowed them to revise their calculations for 2022 based on historical data.

They said that their previous estimate, which was based on weekly data, underestimated the deaths by 10.28 per cent.

The scientists found that weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly data models underestimated both temperature-related mortality compared with a model based on daily figures.

Over longer time periods, the underestimations were more dramatic.

“If there is a heat wave today or an episode of very high temperatures, we see systematically an increase in mortality the same day and then the following days up to 7 to 10 days,” Joan Ballester Claramunt, a researcher at ISGlobal and study author, told Euronews Next.

“So when we use these weekly data sets, which are aggregates of daily mortalities and averages of daily temperatures, [we are] simplifying this delayed association between daily temperature and daily mortality, and when we do that we tend to underestimate the effects of heat,” he added.

Compiling daily data of temperatures and mortality is currently a “titanic effort” that can take years, Ballester said, arguing that the European Union should coordinate these data sets to boost European research.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and Copernicus said in a joint report earlier this year that Europe is the fastest-warming continent in the world, warming twice as much as the global average since the 1980s.

“The record-breaking heat stress that Europeans experienced in 2022 was one of the main drivers of weather-related excess deaths in Europe,” said Dr Carlo Buontempo, the director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service in a June statement, adding that it is not a one-off occurrence.

“Our current understanding of the climate system and its evolution informs us that these kinds of events are part of a pattern that will make heat stress extremes more frequent and more intense across the region,” he added.

Researchers at ISGlobal and Inserm said in July that the European continent will face an average of more than 68,000 heat-related excess deaths each summer by 2030 and more than 94,000 by 2040 unless there is an effective response to climate change.

Ballester said that while researchers can “project future temperatures and temperature-related mortalities, [the future] depends on our actions”.

Through mitigation, “we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the increase in temperatures,” while through adaptation, governments can take several actions, including closer surveillance of people with comorbidities at risk of heat-related death and better forecasting tools and early warning systems.

There are “improvements in the quality of houses, the insulation, ventilation and also a more clever design of cities. These among many others are tools at various different levels that could be implemented to reduce to increase resilience and reduce the impacts,” Ballester said."

He mentioned that the theme of the 21st autumn meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE PA), which he attended these days in Yerevan, was ""OSCE in times of crisis.""

""I argued at the OSCE PA meeting, at the session on security and the role of the OSCE in an era of conflict, that there is a need to adapt to the new political context and the current conflicts both in the OSCE and at the level of the member countries. The security of citizens, democratic and European values are at stake more than at any time since 1945. We must contribute to this by standing side by side with those facing the new shape of evil in this period, as OSCE PA President Pia Kauma has said: 'lasting peace and security require trust and reconciliation, and political leaders have a responsibility to find the way.' As always, over the past year and a half, I have asked all those present to support Moldova in strengthening the basic institutions, building resilience and a sustainable and irreversible European path. Because joining the European Union is an objective that can be achieved by Moldova in the new geostrategic context,"" Barna added.

The new grants to COMESA will focus on improving the overall trade competitiveness of COMESA member states and enhancing their market access.

COMESA Secretary-General Chileshe Kapwepwe commended the EU for the financial support, saying the two agreements will play an important role in enhancing overall competitiveness.

Kapwepwe said the support was part of the broader cooperation to enhance economic development, trade facilitation and regional integration within Africa's largest trading bloc.

""Despite the comparative advantage of the region linked mainly to its natural resources and its potential in agro-processing, textiles and garments, trade remains low compared to other regions, with many traded products being of low added value,"" she said.

1141574254,20231121,"The dictator has been roughly reminded of his place.

Political scientist and historian Roza Turarbekova believes that there have been some problems in relations between China and Belarus recently. There is a reason for sending Aliaksandr Charviakou, who had been minister of economy, to the Celestial Empire.

- I'm very concerned about why Lukashenka didn't come to Beijing for the Belt and Road Forum. I have consulted our Chinese experts on the matter, and one of the most plausible explanations is that Lukashenka has received a 'Chinese warning',"" Roza Turarbekova told Euroradio in an interview.

The political scientist believes that this warning could be linked to the situation on the border with the European Union, which Lukashenka promised to normalise during an official visit to Beijing in early 2023.

- He has failed to keep this promise. Rosa Turarbekova explains. - In all likelihood, this rough reminder is related to that, because it is a very rough reminder by Chinese standards.

The analyst believes that Lukashenka is trying to soften the blow by appointing his economy minister as ambassador to China.

- Lukashenka still believes that ambassadors can work miracles and resolve a situation for which he himself is responsible. After all, no one is to blame but him. And no one but Lukashenka will be able to resolve this situation, at least in the near future,"" the expert explains. - And China has an interest in keeping the situation on the border stable and the goods flowing. And anything that has to do with the destabilisation of the border worries them - no matter who is to blame.

And I think Chinese analysts are writing about who is to blame in this situation. That is why it seems to me that Lukashenka is now being actively thrown out of this Chinese carriage.

As for the former economy minister's appointment as ambassador, the political scientist believes that in the Belarusian hierarchy this is not a relegation but, in a way, a promotion.

- Today, China is one of the priorities. And it's a good opportunity and a good springboard for Charviakou, if he can prove himself. For Lukashenka it is more important to have a good ambassador there than a bad minister here. This is also a signal from Minsk that we want to develop economic relations with you, you see what kind of person we are sending you.

But let's put it this way: for the Chinese it's like a dead poultice. First we need to change Lukashenka's behaviour,"" says Roza Turarbekova.

But the question remains whether Lukashenka can really do anything about the migration crisis and improve relations with European neighbours. - But you see, the Chinese don't care about his ""young Werther's Sorrows"". Those are his personal problems. But their interests are their interests. They need results. They are a rational and very practical people.

If he is unable and incapable of solving the problem, what kind of ""president"" is he of an independent state? Then the Chinese will probably come to the logical conclusion that it's necessary to talk to Putin, not Lukashenka, about settling the situation on the border with the European Union,"" the political scientist says."

The proceeds from the disposal of the underlying Metal, plus any interest received on the proceeds of such disposal less any negative interest, net of any deductions (and converted into the Specified Currency at the rate the Metal Agent determines would be obtainable at the time of conversion which shall be on or about the day of such sale (or, if such day is not an FX business day, the immediately following FX business day, and which may take into account a bid/offer spread quoted by a dealer), will equal the amount due under the ETC Securities (subject to certain minimum amounts owed). The Metal will be held for the Issuer by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor or replacement) (the ""Secured Account Custodian"") and will be generally held on an ""allocated"" basis. This means that specifically identifiable physical items of the Metal are allocated to the Issuer and are segregated from metal held for other clients of the custodian. However, for operational purposes, small amounts of Metal may be held on an ""unallocated"" basis. This means that the Secured Account Custodian maintains an account in the name of the Issuer which shows them as being entitled to delivery of a particular amount of the Metal but without specific physical metal having been identified. Where Metal is held on an ""unallocated"" basis the right to delivery is a purely contractual right and, as such, the Issuer is an unsecured creditor of the custodian and is exposed to the credit risk of the custodian. The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and any underlying Metal. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as ""Secured Property"" for this Series. Securityholders will not, by reason of holding such Series, have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities. The security will become enforceable if payment of the redemption amount in respect of such ETC Securities is not made when due on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the Scheduled Early Redemption Date (defined below) (if applicable). On the Scheduled Maturity Date, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Final Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Final Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount (defined below) and (ii) 10 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security as at the series issue date (the ""Minimum Debt Principal Amount"") plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Final Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Final Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the volume-weighted average prices per metal unit at which the Metal Agent (defined below) is able to sell the underlying Metal (""Average Metal Sale Price"") during the Final Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Final Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Final Redemption Valuation Date. ""Final Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date specified in the Final Terms or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. ""Specified Interest Amount"" is the amount of interest per ETC Security equal to that ETC Security's pro rata share of the amount of interest which has accrued (if any) on the proceeds of realisation of the underlying Metal deposited into the Series Cash Account (defined below) during or relating to the relevant redemption disposal period. Whilst interest may accrue at a positive, zero or negative rate on the Series Cash Account, the Specified Interest Amount is subject to a minimum of zero and any negative interest shall instead be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the underlying Metal. If any of the early redemption events occur, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Early Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Early Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount and (ii) the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Early Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Early Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the Average Metal Sale Price during the Early Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Early Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Early Redemption Valuation Date, save where the Issuer has suspended the determination of the value and Metal Entitlement per ETC Security and no replacement Series Counterparty is appointed, in which case the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the end of such suspension period. The ""Scheduled Early Redemption Date"" is the 8th business day following the Early Redemption Disposal Period. The ""Early Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date of the occurrence of an early redemption event or the date on which the Trustee gives notice that, due to the occurrence of an event of default, the ETC Securities shall become due and payable at their Early Redemption Amount on the Scheduled Early Redemption Date, or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. There can be no assurance that the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, will be greater than or equal to the amount invested by any securityholder. If the Final Metal Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, plus the Specified Interest Amount falls below the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount, then due to the limited recourse nature of the ETC Securities, securityholders are unlikely to receive payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, in full and may receive zero. The Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount per ETC Security, as applicable, will be determined by reference to the Average Metal Sale Price of the underlying Metal held in respect of the ETC Securities sold during the Final Redemption Disposal Period or Early Redemption Disposal Period, as applicable, by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (or any successor or replacement) as ""Metal Agent"", net of associated deductions and taxes. The Issuer will, on or prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date or Scheduled Early Redemption Date, publish the determination of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, (which shall include publication of the price, volume and date of each sale of underlying Metal during the relevant redemption disposal period, including information on any fees, deductions and/or taxes imposed on such sale, and the determination of the Average Metal Sale Price) on the website maintained on behalf of the Issuer at www.etf.dws.com (or such other website notified by the Issuer for the ETC Securities from time to time). The Metal Agent will pay the aggregate proceeds of such disposals (converted, if necessary, into the currency of the ETC Securities) to the cash account for the Series (the ""Series Cash Account"") maintained by J.P. Morgan SE as ""Account Bank"" as directed by the Programme Administrator (defined below). The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest. On early or final redemption of the ETC Securities, a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security, as the case may be. The foreign exchange hedge seeks to reduce the exposure of the ETC Securities to exchange rate fluctuations between the currency in which the ETC Securities are denominated and the currency in which the Metal is quoted. The currency in which the Metal is quoted is known as the ""Metal Currency"". It does this by reflecting the effect of a notional forward sale of the Metal Currency and a corresponding forward purchase of the currency in which the ETC Securities are denominated. The foreign exchange hedge may result in gains or losses to the Issuer. Such gains or losses will result in an increase or decrease in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security and will therefore impact the Value per ETC Security. The Metal Currency for the Series is: U.S. dollar. The foreign exchange hedge is entered into by the Issuer with J.P. Morgan SE as the ""Series Counterparty"". In such role, it enters into a balancing agreement with the Issuer in relation to the ETC Securities (the ""Balancing Agreement"") which provides for deliveries of metal to or by the Issuer to reflect an adjustment for any foreign exchange gain or loss realised by the Issuer. Where there are foreign exchange gains and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security consequently increases, the Series Counterparty will deliver additional Metal equivalent to such increase. Where there are losses and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security consequently decreases, the Issuer will be required to deliver Metal equivalent to such decrease to the Series Counterparty under the Balancing Agreement. All such payments will be in the form of Metal and will settle no later than the second business day after the relevant valuation day. The ETC Securities are subject to a product fee (which comprises a foreign exchange hedging fee) that accrues on a daily basis. Accrued product fee is paid by a daily reduction in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security which, as a result of such reduction, operates as a charge on securityholders. The Issuer will, using the Metal Agent, periodically realise Metal equal to such charge and the proceeds will be credited to the Series Cash Account maintained by the Account Bank in relation to the ETC Securities and used by the Issuer to pay the product fee to the Programme Administrator in accordance with the Programme Administrator Agreement. The Programme Administrator Agreement provides that the Programme Administrator will use the product fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities to pay on behalf of the Issuer the costs of the Programme (as set out in the schedule to the Programme Administrator Agreement) relating to such Series of ETC Securities and the Issuer more generally. The ETC Securities may become due and payable prior to their Scheduled Maturity Date in connection with the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) certain legal or regulatory changes occur in relation to the Issuer and the Issuer gives a notice of redemption; (ii) the Balancing Agreement is terminated in connection with an event of default, a termination event or the valid delivery of an optional termination notice under such Balancing Agreement (and to the extent the optional termination notice is delivered by the Series Counterparty, no replacement is put in place (as discussed further below under ""Optional Termination"")); (iii) any agent in relation to the ETC Securities resigns or their appointment is terminated and the Issuer gives notice that no successor or replacement has been appointed within a 60 calendar day period; (iv) the Value per ETC Security is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price as at the series issue date for two consecutive valuation days and the determination agent gives the relevant notice; (v) the Issuer will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, be required to make a payment in respect of VAT or be required to account for VAT in respect of a delivery of Metal from or to an authorised participant (whether or not such VAT is recoverable); (vi) an Issuer Call Redemption Event occurs (as discussed further below under ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""); (vii) the Issuer becomes entitled to serve a VAT redemption event notice or a termination notice under the Balancing Agreement following a tax event or illegality under the Balancing Agreement and the Trustee gives the relevant notice as directed by the requisite number of securityholders; or (viii) an event of default occurs under the ETC Securities. These include certain breaches by the Issuer of its obligations that are not cured within the applicable cure period and certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer. The Issuer may elect to redeem the ETC Securities early on giving not less than 30 calendar days' notice to securityholders (an ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""). The Issuer or the Series Counterparty may, on giving not less than 30 calendar days' prior notice, terminate the Balancing Agreement. Termination of the Balancing Agreement may result in an early redemption of the ETC Securities if such notice is given by the Issuer, or, in respect of an optional termination notice validly delivered by the Series Counterparty, a replacement Series Counterparty is not appointed within the time specified the terms and conditions. The ETC Securities will rank equally amongst themselves. The rights of securityholders are limited in recourse to the Secured Property. As such, once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed, none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors, officers, members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and, therefore, the rights of securityholders will rank in accordance therewith. As a result of such provisions, the securityholders may not receive in full the final redemption amount or early redemption amount payable in respect of an ETC Security. All payments in respect of the ETC Securities shall be made net of and after allowance for any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes. In the event that any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes applies to payments in respect of the ETC Securities, securityholders will be subject to such tax or deduction and shall not be entitled to receive amounts to compensate for any such tax or deduction. No event of default will occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction. The ETC Securities will be governed by the laws of Ireland. There will be two security deeds relating to the ETC Securities; one will be governed by the laws of Ireland and the other will be governed by English law.

· The amount payable in respect of the ETC Securities is linked to the performance of the underlying Metal. Prices of precious metals are generally more volatile than prices in other asset classes. If the value of such underlying Metal falls, that will reduce amounts payable in respect of the ETC Securities. · The Value per ETC Security, secondary market price and the redemption amount of ETC Securities will primarily be affected by the performance and level of the underlying Metal, rate movements, market perception, the performance and price of foreign exchange futures contracts, the creditworthiness of the Metal Agent and the Series Counterparty, the creditworthiness of the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian and any applicable sub-custodian and liquidity in the ETC Securities. · The foreign exchange hedge does not fully eliminate exchange rate risks or fluctuations and, depending on movements in exchange rates, such currency hedging might have a negative impact on the Value per ETC Security. · The securityholders and other transaction parties will have recourse only to the Secured Property in respect of the ETC Securities and not to any other assets of the Issuer. If, following realisation in full of the Secured Property relating to the ETC Securities, any outstanding claim remains unpaid, then such claim will be extinguished and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect thereof. · The Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is subject to the deduction of the product fee and to any gains or losses incurred by the Issuer in connection with the foreign exchange hedging component. · The Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount (if any) operates as a minimum repayment amount on the early or final redemption of the ETC Securities. However, in the event that the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is insufficient to fund the Minimum Debt Principal Amount payable in respect of each ETC Security to all securityholders on such early or final redemption, such securityholders may not receive payment of the Minimum Debt Principal Amount in full and may receive substantially less. · The Issuer and securityholders are exposed to the credit risk of the Metal Agent, the Programme Administrator (defined below), the Series Counterparty, the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian, the Account Bank, and any sub-custodian and the authorised participants. · Any disruption to a price source or relevant association may affect the Value per ETC Security and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security. · Certain events may lead to an early redemption of the ETC Securities. · ETC Securities may have a long term and the only means through which an investor can realise value from an ETC Security prior to its Scheduled Maturity Date is to sell it at its then market price in a secondary market transaction. While each authorised participant may make a market for the ETC Securities, no authorised participant is obliged to make a market for any series of ETC Securities and an authorised participant may discontinue making a market at any time. Furthermore, any market in ETC Securities may not be liquid and the secondary market price (if any) for ETC Securities may be substantially less than the price paid by the investor. · With respect to any redemption disposal period, if the proceeds from the realisation of the underlying Metal would cause the balance standing to the Series Cash Account to exceed the maximum amount that can be held during the period between December and January of each calendar year (such amount and such period to be agreed from time to time between the Issuer, the Programme Administrator and the Account Bank (the ""Year-End Period"")), then the Programme Administrator may postpone the redemption date until after the Year-End Period, during which time the Metal Agent will not deposit such proceeds into the Series Cash Account and interest equal to the Specified Interest Amount will not accrue on such proceeds for so long as they are not deposited into the Series Cash Account.

As at the date of the Base Prospectus, DWS International GmbH is the ""Programme Administrator"". However, in connection with ongoing or future restructuring and/or reorganisations within the DWS group, it is possible that some of the roles currently performed by DWS International GmbH may be novated, delegated or otherwise transferred to a different entity within the DWS group without the prior written consent of securityholders or the Trustee, provided that it is legally permitted to make such novation, delegation or transfer. DWS International GmbH acting through any of its branches or affiliates may also be an Authorised Participant in relation to a series of ETC Securities. DWS International GmbH has been, or may be, appointed to act as a distributing entity in respect of the ETC Securities. DWS International GmbH, the Programme Administrator, has certain discretions to adjust the levels of the Base Fee Percentage and the FX Hedging Fee Percentage (and, therefore, the Product Fee Percentage and the Product Fee) in relation to each Series of ETC Securities. The remuneration of the Programme Administrator is included in the Product Fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities and depends on the amount of the Product Fees and their sufficiency to cover the costs of the Programme. A DWS entity and/or its affiliates may engage in trading and market-making activities and may hold long or short positions in any metal, other instruments or derivative products based on or related to the metal, metal for their proprietary accounts or for other accounts under their management. DWS entities may also issue securities or enter into financial instruments in relation to any metal. To the extent that any DWS entity, directly or through its affiliates, serves as issuer, agent, manager, sponsor or underwriter of such securities or other instruments, its interests with respect to such products may be adverse to those of the securityholders. Such activities may have an adverse effect on the Value per ETC Security and/or the value of the underlying Metal relating to the ETC Securities."

The relevant video address was posted by Ambassador of the European Union to Ukraine Katarína Mathernová on the social media platform X , an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“Today is the 10th anniversary of the Revolution of Dignity, and sadly the fight for Ukraine's future still continues. With its aggression of more than nine years ago and the full-scale invasion unleashed in February 2022, Russia has attempted to deprive you of your European choice, to silence your voices of truth, to steal your freedom. And yet Ukraine, over these years, has enormously progressed,” Mathernová said.

She mentioned that today Ukraine is a candidate country for EU membership, and earlier this month the European Commission recommended that accession talks be opened.

“The European Union remains by your side. So, today our shared vision is closer than ever before. A prosperous, free, strong and unified Ukraine, a full-fledged member of the European family. We will stand by Ukraine every step on this way. We shall not rest until Ukraine prevails,” Mathernová emphasized.

Sandu, President Volodymyr Zelensky, and First Lady Olena Zelenska paid their respects together to the more than 100 people killed in the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution.

The Day of Dignity and Freedom was established by a presidential decree in 2014. Ukraine celebrates the 10th anniversary of the EuroMaidan and the 19th anniversary of the Orange Revolution this year.

In addition, Sandu said she planned to meet with Michel and Zelensky to discuss the next steps of Moldova and Ukraine's accession to the EU, improving regional security, and the EU's support for reforms and development in the respective countries.

Charles Michel said on X he had arrived in the Ukrainian capital without providing further details on the visit.

""Good to be back in Kyiv – among friends,"" he wrote.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also came to Kyiv on Nov. 21 in an unannounced visit.

The EuroMaidan Revolution began in November 2013, when pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign the long-awaited Association Agreement with the European Union, shortly thereafter receiving a loan from the Kremlin.

The government moved against the revolution in a violent crackdown, which resulted in over 100 protesters killed who are now commemorated in Ukraine as the ""Heavenly Hundred.""

The protests culminated in February 2014 with Yanukovych and other high-ranking officials fleeing to Russia and being replaced by a pro-Western interim government.

1141593823,20231121,"Sekondi, Nov. 21, GNA – Some 26 Persons with Disabilities and other identifiable groups have received a grant amount of GH284, 290.00 to start-up businesses in Agriculture.

The number, was among the total of 240 people trained, made up of 164 males and 76 females under the Skills Development Training of the EU-funded Twin-Cities in Sustainable Partnership Project (TCSPP).

The project is impacting the lives of unemployed youth, women, and return migrants across the Metropolis.

The trainees were taken through four-month classroom and practical training sessions, to form groups and register as social enterprises focusing on crop production, animal husbandry and aquaculture, special training sessions on entrepreneurship and bookkeeping.

Mr. Abdul Mumin Issah, the Metropolitan Chief Executive Officer at the presentation of the grant amount said the beneficiaries had successfully gone through the urban agriculture training and the selection process to receive startups to establish their social enterprises.

Eight of the beneficiaries were selected from 14 applicants, who successfully sailed through the two-stage evaluation process and field inspection of their proposed sites.

The applicants were to propose solutions to address some of the challenges defined by the TCSPP to create job opportunities in the value chain of crop production, animal husbandry and aquaculture.

The MCE said the criteria for determining the exact amount of financial support for an applicant were based on the analysis of a detailed description of the proposed activities, objectives, expected beneficiaries, outputs, costs and site location.

The intervention areas were small irrigation systems for smallholder vegetable farming, vegetable seedlings, small farming implements, materials for homemade greenhouse construction, fingerlings, feed, and materials for catfish rearing; poultry and rabbits’ production.

Similarly, agribusiness software and mobile applications to address the value-chain gap and web-based multi-stakeholder platforms to facilitate information flows and business transactions between suppliers and buyers were also eligible.

The beneficiaries included; the Ghana Federation for Disability Organization Sekondi-Takoradi local, Catholic Special Vocation School, Egyam Children’s Home, Urban Organic Limited, Inchaban Love for all Co-Operative Agric Business Farming and Marketing Society Limited, Sekkoo Glory Lands Co-operative Vegetable and Aquaculture Farming.

The Rest are Marketing Society Limited, Whindo Unique Co-Operative Agric Farmers and Marketing Society Limited, Twin City Smart Women Co-operative Vegetables, Poultry and Aquaculture Farming and Marketing Society Limited.

The agricultural social enterprise project was also in line with the Government of Ghana’s agenda and the European Union’s commitment to address the challenges of unemployment, environmental degradation, food security and to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on livelihoods.

He said the alarming rate of unemployment among the youth in the country could be attributed to some recorded cases of armed robbery, stealing, illicit use of drugs and irregular migration to Europe through the desert and the Mediterranean Sea.

This, National Security had described in Ghana as a national security threat.

Under the TCSPP, an Urban Agriculture Demonstration Farm had been constructed to provide practical training in urban agriculture technologies since the beginning of the project in 2022 in crop production, animal husbandry and aquaculture.

Mr. Isaac Aidoo, the TCSPP, urged the beneficiaries to be faithful stewards of the amount received and work hard to justify the investor confidence in the Metropolitan Area.

“Like the parable of the talents, I expect all of you to go out to your field and cultivate, nurture it to grow and multiply the resources for other generations after you”."

John Braeckeveldt, President of the European Business Association in Georgia; Shalva Papuashvili, Georgian Parliament Speaker; Pawel Herczynski, EU Ambassador to Georgia; Maciej Czura, Head of the EIB Regional Representation for the South Caucasus and Lasha Khutsishvili, Georgian Finance Minister, delivered opening speeches.

Results of the European Business Climate 2023 report were presented at the forum. The forum continued with a panel discussion on the topic of Access to Finances with the participation of representatives of the private sector, diplomatic corps, international organizations, and financial institutions.

The EU-Georgia Business Forum was first held in Georgia in 2022.

“Today we are here for the event of the EU-Georgia Business Forum 2023. This is an extension of the forum we held last year, the European Union Economic Cooperation Platform, which is a platform for business associations to work together in communication. At the same time, we presented the EU Climate Report, which we use as an evidence-based public-private dialogue.

This year we are so happy, thanks to the European Investment Bank, which sponsored today’s event and the European Delegation, which supported the climate report and new business climate report that we are publishing today and providing to everybody, we are happy to hear what are the European businesses’ comments about the economy, problems, and what are improvements from the last year, and what are less improvements what we have.

The report is very interesting and very detailed. It separates big companies from small companies because they have different priorities, and I would recommend reading the report and using it as a basis for next year’s European Union’s Business Association. Doing Business in Georgia will be the same as doing business in Europe, and this is a report to be used to have a result-oriented and evidence-based private dialogue,” said John Braeckeveldt, President of the European Business Association in Georgia.

1141596628,20231121,"Rwanda has made efforts to enhance its oversight of food quality and plant health, known as phytosanitary capacities. The goal is to bring these systems in line with global standards, ensuring that Rwandan products meet international requirements.

According to experts, this is due as Rwanda prepares to engage in trade within the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), where adherence to high-quality standards is essential for successful and seamless cross-border commerce.

On Friday, November 17, insights emerged during a validation workshop of Rwanda's food control system and phytosanitary capacity evaluation.

The event, attended by prominent figures such as Jean-Chrysostome Ngabitsinze, Rwanda's Minister of Trade and Industry, Coumba Sow, FAO Representative in Rwanda, Dr Brian Chirombo, World Health Organization Representative, Amparo Gonzalez Diez from the delegation of the European Union to Rwanda, as well as representatives from food standards institutions and producers, shed light on Rwanda's commitment to enhancing its food control infrastructure.

During a press interview, Ngabitsinze emphasised the substantial costs associated with adhering to international standards. He outlined the need for funding to establish infrastructure and labs equipped to meet these standards, estimating a requirement of over Rwf1.5 billion for the labs and a total project implementation cost exceeding Rwf4 billion.

""This ongoing project involves collaboration with key entities such as FAO, EU, and TradeMark East Africa. The initiative aims to foster collaboration between grassroots actors, including farmers, and authorities and food producers, ensuring the production of high-quality goods,"" he said.

Ngabitsinze expressed the urgency of preparing Rwanda for trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area, emphasising collaboration with other African nations to guarantee the quality of food products they export.

""Rwanda is dedicated to partnering with various stakeholders to implement the outlined strategic actions effectively,"" Ngabitsinze added.

Sow highlighted that the project was designed by FAO and the European Union to assist African nations in evaluating and assessing their food safety, control, and phytosanitary systems.

""Rwanda, actively participating in the initiative, formed an interdisciplinary team from various national institutions to identify strengths and gaps in the existing system. This morning's assessment indicated Rwanda's exemplary status,"" she said.

She emphasised that the identified areas for improvement are within the capacity of institutions to address swiftly. Rwanda's success, compared to other countries, positions it as a positive example in this endeavour.

""The project integrates two advanced tools; the FAO/WHO Food Control System Assessment Tool and the Phytosanitary Capacity Evaluation (PCE) tool. These tools empower countries to evaluate and enhance their food control systems and phytosanitary capacities, contributing to adhering to international standards, fostering improved dialogue, and promoting safe trade and food security in the region,"" Sow said.

Maurice Tuyisenge, from Africa Improved Foods, emphasised their commitment to quality in baby and family food production. The company, known for products like Nootri All Family, believes in meeting high standards for raw materials, especially since they export these products.

""Through training farmers and addressing challenges in crop yields, we've significantly reduced the rejection rate of produce to 95 per cent, and we aim to reach 100 per cent acceptance soon,"" Tuyisenge said.

Jean Claude Bahati, Food Safety Manager at Inyange Industries Ltd, echoed similar sentiments, emphasising the positive impact on exports.

""Inyange's products, present in regional, continental, and global markets, benefit from this initiative, further enhancing our brand image,"" he said.

Bahati emphasised their commitment to quality through a dedicated department for fruit and dairy farmers, ensuring constant awareness of standards. Rigorous cross-checks and testing procedures are implemented to guarantee the release of high-quality food products."
1141596632,20231121,"THE HAGUE, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Dutch voters go to the polls on Wednesday, with four major groupings vying to propose the next prime minister and succeed outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

Here is a look at the top candidates:

Turkish-born Yesilgoz, 46, has a shot at becoming the Netherlands' first woman prime minister, with Rutte's People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), which she now leads, neck and neck with main rivals in recent polls.

In the election campaign, Yesilgoz has distanced herself from Rutte, who has led the country for more than a decade.

She is campaigning to limit migration and says her own experience of fleeing to the Netherlands as an eight-year-old with Turkish Kurdish human rights activist parents informs her views.

Yesilgoz, who serves as Justice Minister, is often characterized as more media savvy than a policy expert. A self-confessed workaholic, she told journalists she only does three things besides work: sleep, exercise and try to eat healthy.

FRANS TIMMERMANS, LEADER OF THE COMBINED LABOUR AND GREEN LEFT TICKET

Known for overseeing the European Union's Green Deal as European Commission Vice President, Timmermans, 62, returned to Dutch politics in August with the ambition of becoming prime minister.

The Labour and Green Left (PvdA/GL) parties running on a single ticket are polling well, alongside VVD and the far right Freedom Party (PVV).

Timmermans has made climate change, a key concern for leftwing voters, the central point of his campaign, along with attempts to win back support of blue-collar workers for Labour.

A son of a diplomat, Timmermans speaks English, German, French, Italian and Russian in addition to Dutch.

GEERT WILDERS, LEADER OF THE FAR RIGHT FREEDOM PARTY

Geert Wilders, 60, internationally known for his fiery anti-Islamic politics, has tried to soften his tone in the current campaign in the hopes of getting his party into government.

He said recently that opposing Islam remains at his party's core but concerns over the cost of living, improving care for the elderly and limiting immigration are what he focuses on now.

After a last minute surge, polls suggest Wilders, one of the country's most recognisable figures thanks to his dyed blond mane, may also have a shot at topping the vote.

His enduring popularity since he created PVV in 2006 has pushed ruling parties over the years to give the Netherlands one of Europe's toughest immigration policies.

Abroad, his comments about the prophet Mohammed and calls for the Koran to be banned led to sometimes violent protests in countries including Pakistan, Indonesia and Egypt.

Death threats against Wilders, who has a conviction for discrimination after he insulted Moroccans at a campaign rally in 2014, mean he has lived under heavy police protection for years.

One of the Netherlands' longest serving parliamentarians Pieter Omtzigt, 49, long seen as a policy wonk, reinvented himself as the political conscience of the country.

Omtzigt, who broke with the Christian Democrats in 2021, founded his own ""New Social Contract"" (NSC) party in August. He is slightly trailing the three frontrunners in some polls.

As a parliamentarian, he earned a reputation as a ""political pit bull"" with his tenacity and in-depth knowledge of complex political questions, coupled with a willingness to challenge ministers of his own party.

One of Rutte's cabinets collapsed in 2021 when Omtzigt played a key role in pursuing a scandal in which thousands of families had been wrongfully accused of benefit fraud on the basis of their ethnicity.

Earlier, Shoigu said marines, aviation and artillery had scuppered further Ukrainian attempts to gain a foothold on the eastern bank of the River Dnipro and on islands at the mouth of the river in southern Ukraine.

Kherson was one among the Ukrainian regions annexed by Russia in February 2022.

In order to show European Union’s support to Ukraine, European Council President Charles Michel arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday. ""Good to be back in Kyiv among friends,"" said Michel on social media platform X, posting a picture of himself shaking hands with the European Union's Ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, at Kyiv's railway station.

Co-existence cannot be possible

Senior Russian diplomat Rodion Miroshnik said that co-existence with the current ‘regime’ in Kyiv is not possible. He also added that Moscow can resist the might of NATO for as long as it needs to demilitarise Ukraine.

It been over a year since Russia-Ukraine war rocked the world. The was has deepened the Russia-West relations as well. Reportedly, Russia now controls 17.5% of Ukraine's internationally recognised territory including Crimea.

""The current regime (in Kyiv) is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for co-existence with it at the moment,"" Russian Ambassador-at-Large Miroshnik told reporters in Moscow.

West and Ukraine had accused Russia of war crimes in Ukraine, which was denied by Moscow.

""We can resist NATO just as much as we need to fulfill the tasks that the president has formulated,"" said Miroshink.

German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius made a surprise visit to Ukraine on Tuesday and vowed to keep supporting Kyiv's efforts to win its war against Russia. Germany is the second biggest financial and military provider to Ukraine after the United States

His visit comes after US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin traveled to Ukraine and pledged American support for the long haul. An additional USD 100 million in weapons was vowed by US.

With the shifting focus on Israel-Hamas war, the efforts are made by the world powers to keep Ukraine-Russia war in focus as well.

According to German officials, Pistorius aimed to assess the effectiveness of its aid as well as take stock of the fighting during his visit.

Meanwhile, two Russian missiles hit a hospital in the eastern Donetsk region, leaving six people wounded and burying many under the rubble, said Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko."

On November 18-19 Minister of National Defence Arvydas AnuÅ¡auskas took part in the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada. He had meetings with Commanding General of the United States Army Pacific and members of the German Bundestag.

When addressing the NATO: Necessary panel, Minister A. AnuÅ¡auskas highlighted the need to accelerate the implementation of the NATO defence plans agreed to in Madrid and Vilnius Summits. It has been agreed to strengthen the air defence in the eastern part of the Alliance and ensure that the Allied defence and security budgets are not smaller than 2 % of GDP, as a matter or urgency for the sake of Allied security.

Minister also accentuated the importance of sustained assistance to Ukraine, saying that ""Lithuania has and will support Ukraine's fight for as long as it takes because it is the security of Europe and the world that is decided on that battlefield. EUR 131,93 billion has been given in European assistance to Ukraine already. Moreover, the European Union is weighing an additional assistance package of EUR 50 billion. The Old Continent makes a serious contribution in helping Ukraine prevail, however, the American input is decisive. Therefore, all efforts must be made to ensure a relentless support,"" underscored A. AnuÅ¡auskas at the round-table discussion.

NATO is the guarantor of the European, Euro-Atlantic and global security, therefore the Allies must be ready for collective defence, to support Ukraine and cooperate with the global partners, said Minister of National Defence at the meeting with Commanding General of the United States Army Pacific Gen Charles A. Flynn. In the discussion on the security threats and challenges in the Indo-Pacific, A. AnuÅ¡auskas pointed out Lithuania's leadership in support to Taiwan. Minister also noted the steadfast support of the United States calling the U.S. force and the NATO enhanced Forward Presence in Lithuania a security guarantee.

The meeting with the Bundestag delegation addressed the consistent military cooperation between Lithuania and Germany and the action plan for stationing the German brigade in Lithuania. Taip pat A. AnuÅ¡auskas also invited Germany to join the demining coalition for Ukraine assembled by Lithuania.

1141610812,20231121,"Internationally-mediated peace talks between the ex-Soviet republics have seen little progress (-)

President Ilham Aliyev on Tuesday accused France of inciting conflicts in the Caucasus by arming Azerbaijan's longtime rival Armenia, with which it has fought two wars.

Baku and Yerevan have been locked in a decades-long territorial conflict over Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region, which Baku reclaimed in September after a lightning offensive against Armenian separatists.

""(France) is pursuing a militaristic policy by arming Armenia, encouraging revanchist forces in Armenia, and laying the groundwork for provoking new wars in our region,"" Aliyev said in written comments to an international conference in Baku.

In a statement read out by his foreign policy advisor, Aliyev said Paris was ""disrupting stability not only in its former and current colonies, but also in the South Caucasus, where it is supporting separatist trends and separatists.""

Home to a large Armenian diaspora, France has been routinely criticised by Azerbaijan for harbouring ""pro-Armenian bias"" in the Caucasus countries' territorial conflict.

Aliyev doubled down on the criticism during a press conference with Iraq's President Abdul Latif Rashid on Monday.

He accused France of ""playing a very destructive role in the Southern Caucasus.""

""The wrong messages from the French government actually create illusions in the Armenian government... that they can again launch a military aggression against Azerbaijan.""

He accused Armenia's government of ""thinking about revenge"" after Azerbaijan regained control over the Nagorno-Karabakh region this fall.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said last week that Yerevan's ""political will to sign a peace agreement with Azerbaijan in the coming months remains unwavering.""

Aliyev said Azerbaijan recently tabled its proposals for a future peace treaty with Armenia and awaited Yerevan's response.

And in a statement Tuesday, his foreign ministry said it ""stands prepared for direct negotiations with Armenia on a bilateral basis to finalize the peace agreement as soon as possible.""

Azerbaijan has recently refused meetings under the mediation of the EU or the US, accusing them of favouring Armenia.

""The responsibility to continue the peace process -- including the selection of a mutually acceptable venue or a decision to meet at the state border -- lies with two countries,"" it said, an apparent refusal of international mediation.

Both leaders have said a comprehensive peace agreement could be signed by the end of the year, but internationally mediated peace talks between the ex-Soviet republics have seen little progress.

Aliyev and Pashinyan have also met on several occasions for talks under the mediation of the European Union.

But last month, Aliyev refused to attend negotiations with Pashinyan in Spain, citing French bias.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz were meant to mediate the talks with EU chief Charles Michel.

There has since then been no visible progress to resume EU-led talks.

Washington had also organised several meetings between the countries' foreign ministries.

Azerbaijan however on Thursday refused further talks, due to what it says is Washington's ""biased"" position.

The traditional regional power broker Russia -- bogged down in its Ukraine war -- has seen its influence wane in the Caucasus.

In 2020, Moscow brokered a ceasefire that ended six weeks of fighting after which Baku reclaimed swathes of territory controlled for three decades by Armenian separatist forces.

After that conflict, Russian President Vladimir Putin has hosted Aliyev and Pashinyan for several rounds of peace talks, most recently in May."
1141606429,20231121,"(MENAFN- Alliance News) Report Ocean published a recovery-based report for Europe Medical RobotMarket that provides crucial details on company opportunities, growth plans, trends, innovations, the competitive landscape in 2022, and the geographic outlook.

The European medical robot market is expected to grow to a value of USD 1.90 Billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 6.07%.

The value of the global medical robot market is expected to reach a value of USD 11.36 Billion by 2023, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.58% during 2018-2023.

Robots which are used for medical purposes are broadly known as medical robots. Medical robotics can be considered as the application of robotics technology to healthcare to diagnose and treat diseases, or to correct, restore or modify a body function or a body part. The market definition for the medical robot market would be the one which take into consideration products for assisting medical practitioners during surgery, for monitoring status of patients, and for increasing accuracy and precision. It also considers products useful for patients with disabilities The products from this market are used extensively across all age groups. These products are generally mechanical/electronic equipment used by doctors and patients.

The medical robot market can be classified into three primary segments .

Based on product (surgical robot, rehabilitation robot, non-invasive radiosurgery robot and others), Based on application (neurology, orthopedic, cardiology, laparoscopy and others) Based on geography (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa).

Furthermore surgical robots consist of neurological surgery robotic systems, cardiology surgery robotic systems, laparoscopic surgical robotic systems, orthopedic surgical robotic systems and steerable robotics. Rehabilitation robots comprise therapeutic robots, prosthetic robots, assistive robots and exoskeleton robots. Hospital and pharmacy automation robots includes pharmacy automation robots, IV robots.

The major factor contributing to the growth of the market in this region is that many governments in the region have various healthcare reimbursement plans for its citizens. There is also a facility of cross-border healthcare in the region which implies that a person who belongs to a country which is part of the European Union (EU), can seek medical help in any of the countries belonging to the EU. The person will get reimbursed by their home country including the cost of prescription and delivery of medicines. This region has advanced Health Technology Assessment plans which measure the value added by a new technology to the sector.

The major impact would be from the United Kingdoms (U.K.) Brexit decision. The decision would make it difficult for the country to control diseases due to financial constraints and exclusion from various policies applicable to countries belonging only to the EU. Also, the recent dispute between Italy and the EU, and the trade dispute between the EU and the United States (U.S.) have made the market highly unstable.

The first hospital in Lviv began its work in September, five more will open by the end of 2023.

Medical facilities are built from modular structures that meet European energy-saving standards. The new hospitals will operate in Pereshchepyne (Dnipropetrovsk Oblast), Shyroke (Zaporizhzhia Oblast), Berezanka (Mykolaiv Oblast), Trostianets (Sumy Oblast) and Chernihiv.

Autonomous solar electric stations with an installed capacity of 70 kW were built for each hospital. They are designed to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of all available medical equipment in the built modules (without considering heating needs). Solar panels are installed both on modular blocks and on the roofs of existing institutions, and on land plots next to the modular hospital – depending on the situation.

The solar station also includes 50 kW backup electric power storage units installed in modular hospitals, hybrid and network inverters, and software for online operation of the stations.

160 kW diesel generators with a fuel reserve have also been installed for emergency power supply to five hospitals.

Space has been arranged around the buildings, and access to modular hospitals for people with disabilities is provided. All facilities, together with generators, are protected by HESCO barriers, which are supposed to protect hospitals from debris in case of possible shelling.

GIZ Ukraine implements activities within the framework of the EU4ResilientRegions – Special Assistance Programme Ukraine project, which is co-financed by the European Union and the German government.

Background: Transformers and solar panels from Japanese partners will arrive in Ukraine in the near future.

The exchange centred on bilateral relations, Switzerland's European policy objectives, Hungary's presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2024 and current international issues.

Both parties acknowledged the historically strong bilateral relations between Switzerland and Hungary, which are due in part to Switzerland's acceptance of 12,000 Hungarian refugees following the 1956 uprising. Trade relations were also mentioned; around 900 Swiss companies operate in Hungary, generating 29,000 jobs there. The Swiss delegation emphasised the importance of reliable and predictable conditions to encourage investment in the country.

A further topic was cooperation with Hungary, which is one of the recipients of the second Swiss contribution to selected EU countries. Vocational education and training, research and innovation are key aspects of this cooperation. Mr Berset explained that Switzerland attaches great importance to involving a range of stakeholders, in particular civil society, in the implementation of programmes and projects. With regard to European policy, the Swiss side reaffirmed its goal of stabilising and further developing the bilateral approach with the EU. The Hungarian presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2024 was also discussed.

In discussions on current international issues, the topics included the situation in the Middle East and the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, with the Swiss delegation emphasising the importance of international humanitarian law and the role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In Switzerland's view, this is an important platform for maintaining dialogue with countries that do not share the same values with regard to the security architecture in Europe."
1141616748,20231121,"(MENAFN) The European Union is reportedly deliberating a proposal that could curb the free movement of Russian diplomats within states of the Schengen area, marking a potential escalation in the bloc's sanctions against Moscow. The suggestion comes as part of discussions surrounding the European Union's 12th round of sanctions on Russia, with the Czech Republic voicing concerns that the borderless zone facilitates the entry of Russian 'agents' who can evade monitoring.

 

 The Czech Republic, which has raised the issue among European Union member states, proposes a measure that would limit Moscow's diplomatic staff to travel only within their host country, excluding the rest of the Schengen area. Additionally, Prague advocates for the acceptance of only biometric passports, citing their enhanced security features and resilience against forgery or fraudulent use.

 

 The specific concern centers around Russian officials who, under Austrian visas to work at Union Nation agencies in Vienna, can freely visit the Czech Republic and other Schengen states. The Czech authorities argue that the existing Schengen framework complicates the monitoring and control of individuals, including alleged agents of Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU.

 

 While the debate on this matter is in its early stages, the proposal faces legal complexities, making it uncertain whether the changes advocated by Prague will be incorporated into the sanctions package under discussion. The move highlights the growing unease within the European Union regarding the ease with which Russian diplomats can move across Schengen states, potentially engaging in activities that are of concern to member nations.

 

 The timing of this proposal coincides with heightened tensions between Russia and the European Union, particularly in the aftermath of Russia's military operation in Ukraine. Last year, the United Kingdom's MI6 chief, Richard Moore, disclosed that numerous Russian embassy staff in European countries had been expelled on accusations of being ""intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover."" As the European Union weighs its response, the potential restrictions on the movement of Russian diplomats underscore the evolving dynamics of diplomatic relations in the region."

As part of the continued humanitarian efforts as first responder to support people of the Himalayan nation in their times of need, India has regularly sent aid to Nepal since the 6.4-magnitude earthquake on November 3 that jolted Jajarkot and Rukum districts killing 153 people and injuring over 260 others.

The November 3 quake caused the worst human and infrastructure losses since the devastating jolt of April 2015. On November 7, three tremors of over magnitude 4 hit Jajarkot injuring at least 16 people.

Fourth tranche of relief support comprising vital medicines & equipment for the earthquake-affected families reaches Nepal. India’s humanitarian efforts continue to support people in Nepal, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar posted on X along with photos of the relief material being handed over to Nepalese authorities.

The latest tranche comes after five elderly people, including two women, who were staying in makeshift tents died last week due to harsh cold weather in Jajarkot district. Their homes were rendered uninhabitable by the destructive earthquake, which damaged around 8,000 buildings, both public and private.

Carried by a special Indian Air Force (IAF) C-130 flight, the third tranche comprising blankets, sleeping bags, tents and essential medical supplies, etc. for the quake-affected families in the mountainous region where people are facing a shortage of food, warm clothes and medicines, was delivered on November 9.

This consignment had reached three days after the second such aid of nine tonnes reached here on November 6. The second consignment too had essential medical and hygiene supplies, tents, sleeping bags and blankets.

India was amongst the first countries to send relief material just two days after the November 3 quake as its first consignment of more than 11 tonnes of relief materials including tents, tarpaulin sheets, blankets, and sleeping bags along with essential medicines and medical equipment reached Nepal on November 5.

Apart from India, Nepal continues to receive aid from various foreign bodies. Last week, the European Union had provided a EUR 2 million aid package to Nepal. The grant assistance provided by the EU is equivalent to around Nepalese Rs 290 million and will help provide shelter, access to clean water and sanitation, and health care, among other services, to support the earthquake-affected people in the Jajarkot and Rukum districts of Nepal. In 2015, a 7.8 magnitude quake damaged nearly 800,000 houses besides killing nearly 9,000 people, according to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment Report, 2015."
1141625713,20231121,"A senior member of Myanmar's shadow civilian leadership, the National Unity Government, on Tuesday urged Japan to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on Myanmar's military in coordination with ASEAN in a bid to end the junta's brutal rule.

Zin Mar Aung, the NUG's foreign minister, made the call in a meeting with Japanese lawmakers in Tokyo as an unprecedented offensive by ethnic minority groups in northeastern Myanmar in late October and ensuing attacks by insurgents in other border areas have posed the biggest challenge to the junta since it seized power in a 2021 coup.

""Without dealing with the State Administration Council, Japan should establish diplomatic relations with the NUG, which represents the people of Myanmar,"" Zin Mar Aung said through an interpreter, in reference to the official name of the junta led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.

""The European Union and the United States are imposing coordinated financial sanctions (on the junta and related entities), but no Asian countries are enforcing such measures,"" she told the meeting, which was open to the media. ""If Asian countries enforce economic sanctions, it would put significant pressure on the junta.""

Zin Mar Aung is on a 12-day visit to Japan through Nov. 28 for meetings with Myanmar residents, among other engagements. It is her first trip to to the country as the NUG foreign minister.

Her visit also comes before Prime Minister Fumio Kishida hosts leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-member grouping of which Myanmar is a member, next month for a special Japan-ASEAN summit in Tokyo.

Zin Mar Aung requested that Japan provide humanitarian assistance to displaced people in her conflict-hit country without involving the military, alluding to allegations that aid is diverted to the junta instead of reaching people in need.

""If Japan extends aid to internally displaced people through an organization run by the NUG and ethnic minority groups, it will immediately save many people from their sufferings,"" she said.

Since the Myanmar military detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and toppled her democratically elected government in the Feb. 1, 2021, coup, the junta has killed about 4,200 demonstrators and other citizens, leading to the displacement of some 2 million people, according to U.N. and other data.

Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict -- led by the United Nations and ASEAN -- have stalled, with the military refusing to engage with the NUG.

1141625715,20231121,"The Czech Republic is trying to use its ties with neighboring Slovakia to keep Bratislava in Europe's pro-Ukraine camp but Slovakia's new PM, Robert Fico, is an ally of Hungary's pro-Russian leader Viktor Orban.

For more than 70 years — with the exception of a period during the Second World War — the Czech Republic and Slovakia were one united state, Czechoslovakia. On December 31, 1992, this state split peacefully into the two Central European countries we know today.

In 2000, just four years before they joined the European Union, the Czech Republic and Slovakia signed a number of comprehensive agreements on language and social matters that strengthened their historically close ties.

To this day, the Slovak and Czech cabinets regularly hold joint meetings, and the first official visits of presidents, prime ministers and ministers alike is always to the capital of the other country.

Internationally, too, the two countries have so far walked, if not in step, very close to one another.

There was one notable exception to this rule: Immediately after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, Slovakia was labeled ""the black hole of Europe"" due to the actions of the nationalist authoritarian regime of former PM Vladimir Meciar (1993–1998).

It was excluded from the first round of NATO expansion and membership of the European Union because it fulfilled neither entities' democratic criteria.

In which direction will Slovakia move?

The recent election of Robert Fico and his national-conservative Smer party raises a number of questions.

Will relations between Prague and Bratislava return to the way they were during the Meciar era? Will, as one diplomat in Prague put it, Slovakia ""succeed in staying in the Czech orbit""? Or will Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who repeatedly expressed his unequivocal support for Robert Fico in the run-up to the September 30 parliamentary election in Slovakia, manage to get the new Slovak government on his side.

The main bone of contention in all this is support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. The Czech Republic has been and continues to be one of Ukraine's greatest supporters in terms of both arms deliveries and financial and humanitarian support.

Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala was one of the first three European leaders to travel to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on March 15, 2022 — just weeks after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Slovakia's new PM, Robert Fico, on the other hand, has pledged to stop his country's support for the war-torn country. One of his party's election slogans was, ""No more bullets for Ukraine.""

He stuck to this line after the election, declaring in early October that ""the roots of the war in Ukraine go back to 2014, when Ukrainian fascists murdered civilians of Russian nationality.""

So far, however, these strong words have not been followed up by many deeds, not least because of the diplomatic pressure from the Czech Republic.

As Slovak ministers made their traditional first trips to Prague after the election, it became clear that their refusal to send aid to Ukraine was not as clear-cut as it initially appeared.

The government in Bratislava will not terminate any of the agreements on the supply of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, not even those concluded by state-owned arms factories.

""Everything on a commercial basis will remain unchanged and will continue as before,"" said the new Slovak foreign minister, Juraj Blanar, after meeting his Czech counterpart, Jan Lipavsky, in Prague on November 6. ""Slovakia has sent comprehensive humanitarian aid to Ukraine and we want to continue this support,"" he said

The new Slovak government sees mine clearance as part of this aid and has offered Kyiv the services of Slovak specialists.

Deeds count more than words, says Prague

In early November, the new government demonstratively rejected the predecessor government's plans for military aid in the form of ammunition from Slovak stock worth €40 million ($44 million).

But none of this seems to rattle Prague. ""I judge not words, but deeds,"" Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky told DW. ""Slovakia's ammunition deliveries to Ukraine — which are not insignificant — continue.""

Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala is also trying to keep Fico and the government in Bratislava close. The two men met at the EU summit in Brussels in October 2023.

""We will have different views on a range of foreign policy questions, that is true,"" Fiala said after the meeting. ""We may have different ideas on this matter or that, but we must search for a common language; that is our obligation, and that is the way I approach it.""

The two men agreed that Fico would come to Prague as soon as possible — potentially on November 24 — for his traditional first trip abroad as PM.

According to diplomatic sources, the biggest stumbling block is Fico's insistence that he be received by Czech President Petr Pavel. General Pavel, who was chairman of NATO's Military Committee until 2018, is staunchly pro-Ukraine.

According to diplomatic circles in Prague, both governments are currently negotiating a public declaration for Fico on support for Kyiv.

Czechs in no hurry to have Visegrad summit

In other areas, too, Prague is trying to diplomatically drive a wedge between Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

The Czech government, which currently holds the presidency of the Visegrad Group (V4), rejected Fico's request to call a summit of the group's prime and foreign ministers. Fico had hoped to persuade the V4 states — Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary — to jointly reject the EU migration package. Both Hungary and Warsaw's outgoing PiS government are opposed to the package; the Czech Republic supports it.

Prague rejected Slovakia's proposal, explaining that it would wait for a new Polish government under the leadership of the pro-European Donald Tusk, who is currently leader of the opposition.

""We don't just want to meet for the sake of meeting,"" said Lipavsky, ""but to deal with the actual, real politics of Central Europe.""

Experts assume that if Tusk becomes Polish PM, Poland and the Czech Republic will join forces and put pressure on Fico and isolate Orban within the Visegrad Group.

Hungary is not taking this lying down

None of this is lost on Hungary, which is why Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto made a beeline for Bratislava on November 7, straight after his Slovak counterpart's visit to Prague.

""We don't forget the value of good neighborly relations with Hungary,"" Blanar said after the meeting.

For the moment, however, even after a few weeks in government, Fico's Cabinet would appear to be focusing its attention on the Czech Republic. In so doing, it is leaning towards the Czech Republic's pro-European and — to a certain extent — pro-Ukrainian stance.

At a joint news conference in Kyiv with European Council President Charles Michel and Moldova's leader, Zelenskiy told reporters that the European Union's decision next month would be a challenge for the unity of the bloc."
1141631392,20231121,"Accra, Nov. 21, GNA – Work on the construction of military operating bases along Ghana’s northern frontiers has reached an advanced stage of completion, says President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.

The facilities, comprising twelve military forward operating and three logistic bases, aim to strengthen the Army’s capabilities to contain the threats emanating from across the country’s frontiers.

Ghana remains one of the most peaceful countries in sub-Saharan Africa despite the growing instability in the Region – borne out of violent extremism, terrorist attacks and military coups.

President Akufo-Addo, addressing army officials at a graduation parade of the Ghana Military Academy, in Accra, assured that the country was taking no chances in respect of securing its territorial integrity.

The military operating bases, he said, would be adequately resourced with personnel and the requisite logistics to swiftly deal with any threats that had the potential to disrupt the peace and stability of the country.

The Sahel Region is the epicentre of terrorism worldwide, says the Institute for Economics and Peace.

From January 1 to June 30, 2023, it is estimated that the Region recorded 1, 814 incidents of terrorist attacks, which resulted in 4, 593 fatalities.

The political instability has been exacerbated by the spiraling military coups, with the elected Presidents of Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger, forcibly removed from office in the last three years.

Given the prevailing security threats, the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) continues to receive support, in terms of military assistance, from international bodies, including the UN and European Union (EU).

“The eminent threats in the northern part of Ghana have necessitated the establishment of forward operating and logistics bases along our entire northern border,” the President said.

In pursuance of its determination to build the capacity of the personnel, the Armed Forces had also initiated the process for the grant of a presidential charter for the establishment of a National University of Defence Studies, he noted.

“I have directed that the University be established next year,” President Nana Akufo-Addo, also the Commander-in-Chief, affirmed.

He said it would serve as a multi-disciplinary higher education institution that would educate personnel of the GAF, other security agencies, governmental departments and agencies and foreign military personnel. It will conduct scientific research in military science, defence and strategic studies, international relations and related subjects.

It is intended to serve as a model research and educational centre for the conduct of long-term research, capacity building and policy shaping in the fields of defence and security as well as current analysis and strategic studies for various state institutions.

A Senior UN official recently told the Security Council that the situation in West Africa and the Sahel had deteriorated against a backdrop of shrinking civic and political space.

The Special Representative and Head of the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Leonardo Santos Simao, said the “crisis in the Sahel requires tangible and long-term support to stamp out the scourge of terrorism and address the Region’s burgeoning humanitarian crisis”."

1141637299,20231121,"Forum for Democracy (FvD) party leader Thierry Baudet was hospitalised on Monday evening after he was hit in the head with a glass beer bottle in a cafe in Groningen.

Baudet, who was holding an election meeting with members of his party, was attacked for the second time in a month, as a man approached him and smashed a glass bottle against the side of his head, public broadcaster NOS reports.

On social media, the FvD party reported that Baudet was taken to a hospital in Groningen, saying: “A trauma surgeon has just treated Thierry Baudet. He was hit on the back of the head with a beer bottle and was also hit on the edge of his temple just next to his eye.”

The party went on to say that a security guard also suffered facial injuries during the attack, which also prompted the cancellation of another campaign event in Zwolle on Monday evening.

Politicians from across the political spectrum condemned the violence against the populist party leader, who has served as a member of the Dutch House of Representatives since 2017.

Prime Minister Rutte described the attack as “totally unacceptable”, adding: “I said it before and repeat it firmly now: stay away from politicians. Always.”

The leader of the farmer protest party BBB, Caroline van der Plas condemned the “disgusting and cowardly attack again against Thierry Baudet… Violence is unacceptable! Good luck to Thierry!”

Frans Timmermans, the prime ministerial candidate for the leftist-green GroenLinks-PvdA coalition, also condemned the attack, writing: “Violence is always unacceptable. In a democracy, we fight each other with words and this attack cannot be justified in any way. Wishing you a lot of strength.”

“Finally protect that man, enough damn it!” exclaimed fellow anti-mass migration conservative leader Geert Wilders, whose PVV party has surged to the top of the polls ahead of the Dutch general election on Wednesday.

There have been growing fears among the left and the neo-liberal establishment of the growing possibility of a right-wing coalition government taking power in the Netherlands after over a decade of globalist rule under outgoing PM Mark Rutte.

Less than a month ago, Baudet, who has been an outspoken critic of mass migration and the European Union, suffered a concussion after he was attacked by a man who hit him over the head with an umbrella as he was visiting Ghent University.

There has been a wave of attacks against politicians in Europe of late, including this month’s shooting of the founder of the populist Vox Party, 78-year-old Alejo Vidal-Quadras, in Madrid in what may have been an attempted assassination over his political stance on Iran. In August, the head of the German AfD party in the Bavarian district of Augsburg, Andreas Jurca, was brutally beaten on his way to a campaign event by two men of suspected migrant origin."
1141646623,20231121,"Meeting between the Forces of Freedom and Change and South Sudan mediation committee in Juba (Photo: Peter Louis / social media)

A delegation from the Forces for Freedom and Change-Central Council (FFC-CC) have arrived in the capital of South Sudan, Juba, at the invitation of President Salva Kiir, to discuss issues including a direct and public meeting with the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

In their public statement, the Forces of Freedom and Change explained that the delegation will hold meetings with several government officials in South Sudan on ways to end the war in Sudan, achieve peace, and establish a democratic civil transition.

“Conversation topics will include efforts to unify civil democratic forces, the recent discussions in Addis Ababa, and what emerged from our meetings in Cairo, along with plans for a direct and public meeting with the SAF and RSF,” it said.

The Executive Office of the FFC-CC kickstarted four days of meetings in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, last Thursday.

During the African summit meetings, Salva Kiir met with the presidents of Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Kenya, in addition to SAF Commander-in-Chief and President of the Sovereignty Council Lt Gen Abdelfattah El Burhan, indicating that all parties welcome the involvement of South Sudan.

Several initiatives are actively working to resolve the Sudanese crisis, including the Jeddah Platform, mediated by Saudi Arabia, the United States, the African Union, the Civil Front to Stop the War, and the IGAD Quartet, headed by Kenyan President William Ruto.

The European Union affirmed its “interest in what is happening in Sudan,” and its keenness to end the war, address the humanitarian catastrophe, achieve stability, and resume the democratic transition.

On Sunday, representatives of the Communication and External Relations Committee of the Forces of Freedom and Change held a meeting with a delegation from the European Union, which included the Swedish envoy to Sudan, the ambassadors of Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, and the European Union representative in the Arab Republic of Egypt, in Cairo.

In their statement, the FFC-CC said that they presented their vision, which is based on the need to coordinate international and regional efforts in a unified negotiating platform, and the need for the political process to be comprehensive, and to address the reasons that led to the outbreak of war and develop final solutions to it.

They aim for democratic civil transformation and a single professional government, and for the national army to leave politics completely.

FFC-CC’s representatives emphasized the coalition’s involvement in efforts to build a broader anti-war civil democratic front based on the preparatory meeting that was held late last month in Addis Ababa.

Referring to the Civil Front to Stop the War, inaugurated in Addis Ababa last month, Siddig El Sadig El Mahdi, a leader in the FFC-CC, emphasised that “real unity among democratic and civil forces is crucial for ending the war.” The meeting resulted in the formation of the Coordination of Democratic Civil Forces (Takaddum) in preparation for an inclusive founding conference.

Last week, the EU expressed its shock at the recent escalation of violence in Darfur. High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell said in a statement that “the latest atrocities are seemingly part of a wider ethnic cleansing campaign conducted by the RSF to eradicate the non-Arab Masalit community from West Darfur, and comes on top of the first wave of violence in June.”"
1141649441,20231121,"Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, promises to do everything possible so that Ukraine and Moldova receive a decision on the start of negotiations on joining the EU by the end of the year.

Source: Michel told this to journalists after talks with the presidents of Ukraine and Moldova in Kyiv, the correspondent of European Pravda reports.

Details: Michel emphasised that the path of Ukraine and Moldova to join the EU was one of the topics of the negotiations that took place on Tuesday, and at this meeting, he made a promise to his colleagues, which he then undertook to repeat publicly, in the presence of journalists.

""Dear President Zelenskyy, dear President Sandu, dear people of Ukraine and people of Moldova, I assure you, I will spare no effort in supporting your legitimate ambitions and aspirations,"" he said.

The head of the European Council emphasised that it is not about the accession itself but about the beginning of a long process, which is demanding, ""it can be frustrating"", and also reiterated that both countries will need to fulfil many tasks, including the issue of the rule of law; however, the first step must be taken right now.

""[I will] do anything to convince my 27 colleagues (leaders of EU member states – UP) that we need a positive decision in December,"" he said.

Michel also provided three key arguments with which he will convince the participants of the summit.

Firstly, he believes that the start of negotiations on the accession of Ukraine and Moldova to the EU will be a ""message to the European citizens that we are taking care of our coming future in…security and prosperity"" because, in his opinion, such enlargement will make Europe safer and richer.

Secondly, it will be a message ""to the people of Ukraine and the people of Moldova…that we are reliable, that we are serious, that we are loyal,"" said Michel, emphasising that this is also a valid argument for the 27 leaders.

And thirdly, the start of negotiations with Ukraine, which was attacked by Russia, ""is a message to the Kremlin, and is a message to all those in the world who would like to undermine the rules-based order"".

As it is known, the EU summit is to be held in Brussels on 14-15 December, where the issue of enlargement will be one of the key issues. In recent days, there have been signals from the EU that the EU may not support the start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession during the December summit. The possibility of postponing this decision until March is supposedly being considered due to the lack of unity in the European Union. Hungary publicly promises to block a positive decision for Kyiv.

Our school is very special for many reasons. We have fantastic staff, who inspire and support students to succeed, and our ethos provides a calm and caring learning environment which you can feel as you walk around the Academy.

The contract will commence on 1 August 2024 for an initial period of three years, ending on 31 July 2027, with the opportunity to extend for a further period of two years at the discretion of the governing body.

This contract will be fixed price in nature with the successful Supplier guaranteeing both the number of input hours to the contract and the quality of cleaning provision.

We are seeking a suitably experienced Supplier who has current experience of working within the secondary school marketplace, ideally with a strong operational base within the Lincoln area, thus allowing for both adequate contract support and operational flexibility that is to be delivered to support the contract as and when required moving forwards into this contract term.

The scope of the contract covers all cleaning provision within the school buildings. The successful Supplier will be expected to deliver a concise and detailed method of management reporting at the end of each month, thus updating the school senior management team on the contract performance.

Any variations to the contract that are requested by the Client should be invoiced at the agreed rate and should be calculated on an hourly rate per employee needed to carry out the variation to the satisfaction of the contract supervising officer. The Client’s requirement shall be for 190 academic days, 0 inset days and 20 days periodic cleaning per annum. The Academy has a number of daytime staff who undertake reactive cleaning, lunch supervision and litter picking duties and they shall be used to undertake cleaning on inset days.

Whilst the monthly charge will represent one-twelfth of the contract cost, a reconciliation will take place monthly to reconcile the actual hours worked within the contract. If the hours worked are less than those budgeted for a credit will be required by the Client. The Client requires that the tendered number of hours are always worked, and the successful Supplier is expected to have a system in place to cover for both planned and unplanned leave.

The Supplier shall provide a comprehensive cleaning service to the Client to promote a clean, healthy, and safe environment which presents a positive image to all users and visitors.

1141672329,20231121,"The ever so volatile Middle East has traditionally been a dangerous place for the world peace for long and it is once again in news for the same reasons. The Palestinian militant organization Hamas shocked and surprised Israel during the wee hours of the 7th October 2023 when a large number of its fighters/militants breached the Gaza-Israel security fencing and recklessly attacked civilian population and military posts in many parts of the Southern Israel. Almost simultaneously a barrage of missiles/rockets were also randomly fired by them from the Gaza Strip targeting various Israeli locations inflicting heavy and indiscriminate damages to civil and military establishments.

Normally, Israeli administration, the defence forces and Mossad (the Israeli Secret Service) are considered to be very alert, efficient and one of the best, but all agencies were caught unaware and off-guard remaining almost ineffective and clueless for the first few hours in this case. Consequently, the Hamas fighters merrily accomplished their heinous terror task leaving behind a trail of nearly 1,400 Israelis dead in various attacks, besides taking away with them over two hundred hostages, including women, children and elderly people. Of course, this was only a prelude to the holocaust in store for the Gaza people in the form of collateral damage as the Israelis too were prompt to recover and commence a fierce counter-offensive against the Hamas perpetrators.

Hamas is an acronym for its official name Harakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyyah (i.e the Islamic Resistance Movement), a Palestinian Sunni Islamic organization, governing the Gaza Strip of the designated Palestine territory. It was founded by Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian imam and activist in 1987, which increasingly became involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the later half of 1990s, opposing the then Israel-PLO reconciliation efforts, including the Oslo Accords seeking renouncement of the terrorism and other acts of violence in pursuance of the two-state solution envisaged in the UN resolution. The Hamas advocating an armed resistance won the Palestine legislative election in 2006 and took control of the Gaza Strip from the Fateh in a civil war in 2007. Ever since, it is administering Gaza in a de facto autocratic mode and as one-party state. Owing to its violent and criminal acts against the Jews and humanity, several western countries including the US and UK have officially designated it as a terrorist organization, while the Arab states and their supporters and sympathizers recognize it as a political and nationalist organization.

The Hamas does not recognize the Israel as a legitimate state and talks of an Islamic Palestinian suzerainty over the complete territory of Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. During the last two decades, the Hamas and Israel have been under constant conflict and fought several wars, including more serious and widespread in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014. On the last occasion in May 2021, owing to some unfortunate incidents in the Sheikh Jarrah and the al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem, tensions between the Hamas and Israel escalated leading to an eleven-day intense fighting and shelling from either side, in which reportedly 243 people in Gaza and 12 in Israel were killed with many others injured. The Hamas leaders and commanders have time and again reiterated, including the present war, that their Group is conscious and fully aware of the consequences of an attack on Israel and that the Palestine liberation will only come with sacrifices.

In the current war of 2023, the Hamas launched an invasion in the code named “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood” on 7 October with its fighters breaching and breaking through the Gaza-Israel barrier, attacked a few Israeli military bases, Indiscriminately massacred civilians including women and children, publicly raped and humiliated women of all ages, and took many civilian and soldier hostages back to their bases. The biggest tragedy occurred at a music festival where many of these fighter-terrorists paraglided and proceeded to massacre hundreds of civilians, while the Israel was caught completely unaware and unprepared at the time. Withing few hours, over 1,400 Israeli people were killed, recording it as one of the deadliest attacks by the Palestinian militants/terrorists since the proclamation of Israel as an independent state.

The attack has been described as the biggest military setback for Israel since the 1973 Arab–Israeli War. In response, Israel has enforced Gaza blockade and began a large-scale aerial bombardment campaign over the territory before an intended ground assault, having announced its intention to destroy Hamas. The European Union and the US have also called for the elimination of Hamas. Several video clips are circulating on the social media and international human right groups, journalists and medical personnel have illustrated the Hamas attackers' onslaught and inhuman deeds, which inter alia included the decapitation, rape and burning of women, children and elderly, besides the young men and soldiers, as the US Secretary of State reportedly described as “It's simply depravity in the worst imaginable way”. Of course, Israeli political leadership and military soon geared up and have launched the biggest and most lethal operation with a resolve to continue until the Hamas is completely destroyed. In a war of over one month now, the significant events are briefly indicated here.

According to reports, The Hamas attack started during early hours with about 5,000 missiles/rockets launched in various parts of Israel in a short spell. Nearly simultaneously, the Supernova Music Festival near the Re'im secular kibbutz (Hebrew: Cohesive Group/Gathering) in Southern Israel was stormed by Hamas militants, some of whom arrive as motorized paragliders, where at least 260 people were killed and unnumbered people abducted from the venue. During these attacks, about 1,400 people were reported killed and over 200, including women and children, were taken back as hostages. Within hours, Israel sounded a state of alert for war and started counter-offensive against the Hamas in Gaza by the Israeli Air Force. The top leaders of the US, India and many in the Western Europe expressed shock and support to Israel in combating the terror attacks, with the US announcing its solid and unwavering moral and material support.

During the next few days, the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) intensified its operation against Hamas blockading the Gaza Strip besides accelerating their evacuation and relief operation to own civilians in terror affected parts. Israel declared its intended goal to eliminate military capabilities of Hamas and end their rule over the Gaza Strip. In the meanwhile, a few sporadic attacks from the Hezbullah and other militant Groups from the neighboring countries had commensurate response from the Israel but the latter has exercised restraint so far in further escalating it. The US dispatched its USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean with advanced fighter planes on board to tackle the situation in case of the escalation of hostilities through a possible participation of the other neighboring Arab countries in the war and also sent the first batch of the advanced weaponry for the use of the IDF in war. The world appeared to be bipolar now with the US, its NATO allies and many other democracies supporting Israel, while the Arab world and their sympathizers justifying the Hamas cause and action.

Contrary to the initial assessment and expectations of the Israel in tackling Hamas, the latter turned out to more difficult and better equipped for own survival. According to reports, the Hamas have constructed hundreds of underground tunnels in North Gaza, many under the secured buildings, and it is an onerous and uphill task to locate and nab them in their hideouts, although IDF has claimed to have liquidated several prominent Hamas commanders. Consequently, the aerial strikes and now ground attacks have continued even after one month of the war. Israel has asked Palestinian civilians to leave Northern Gaza and move to Southern Gaza for personal safety during the aerial and ground operations. Iran has repeatedly warned Israel to immediately stop action against the Hamas, threatening pre-emptive strikes if the latter fails to comply its warnings. The US has deployed yet another Naval Group of the carrier USS Eisenhower by mid-October to supplement already deployed the USS Gerald Ford as an added deterrence against any enemy misadventure in the Middle East region. In the meantime, for an explosion at the al-Ahli Arab Hospital leading to several deaths, both the warring sides are blaming each-other.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has announced that after the destruction of Hamas, they would relinquish control of the Gaza Strip following the induction of a new security. The IDF air strikes and now ground operations with effect from 27 October have continued with the total block of the Gaza Strip including the stoppage of the water, fuel, food and electricity; recently, a limited access for the humanitarian aid has been permitted but, reportedly, Gaza is facing acute shortage of potable water, food and fuel. The ongoing war has so far led to a widespread death of over 11,000 Palestinians and 1,600 Israelis. Similarly, according to the UN reports, around 1.5 million Palestinians as well as over 2 lakh Israelis have been internally displaced. The war has also triggered massive global protests (perhaps many purportedly staged too), mainly anti-Israel, highlighting various issues such as the immediate ceasefire. Prompt release of hostages, condemnation of the actions of both Hamas and Israel, and so on. The UN efforts have not succeeded and their resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire was vetoed by the US in the Security Council. On their part, Israel is sticking with their resolve to continue war till Hamas is completely eliminated. To have a clearer view of the prevailing conundrum, it would be relevant to peek into the history of Israel and Arab-Israel relations since the formation of the tiny state of Israel in 1948. To be continued…."
1141686100,20231121,"The European Union is discussing a Czech proposal for possible restrictions on movement within the Schengen space for Russian diplomats. The Czech Republic has proposed that Russian diplomats be issued visas and residence permits that only allow travel within their host country and not the rest of the Schengen area on the argument that Russian agents work undercover as diplomats and evade monitoring thanks to the EU’s borderless zone. Prague also proposed only accepting biometric passports, which are more difficult to forge.

Czech Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Drake said the ministry would not disclose further details since talks on the proposal are still underway.

According to the Financial Times, Prague last week circulated a paper with the proposal as part of negotiations on the EU’s 12th package of sanctions against Moscow, which member states still need to approve."
1141686103,20231121,
1141686108,20231121,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Union has presented member states with a framework to give Ukraine lasting security commitments, including a mechanism for longer-term military support, the training of Ukrainian troops and help to boost the country’s defense industry.

The draft paper, which was seen by Bloomberg, will be discussed by EU ambassadors this week and by the bloc’s leaders next month. It will also form the basis of consultations with Kyiv and the Group of Seven nations.

G-7 members agreed at a NATO summit earlier this year to negotiate a collection of bilateral security guarantees with Ukraine aimed at deterring future Russian aggression. For its part, Ukraine committed to continue a series of reforms, including to law enforcement, its judiciary as well as security and defense sectors. Some of Kyiv’s key allies are seeking to conclude bilateral agreements this year.

The EU’s framework aims to build on those bilateral arrangements, with proposals including:
• “A predictable, efficient, sustainable and long-term mechanism for the provision of military equipment to Ukraine” that mobilizes the European defense industry
• Greater cooperation with the Ukrainian defense industry to boost capacity and align standards
• Strengthening Ukraine’s ability to counter cyber and hybrid threats as well as disinformation
• Helping Ukraine with its reform agenda relating to its EU accession process, as well as boosting its ability to monitor stocks of firearms, light weapons and ammunition and counter any illegal trafficking

The discussion comes as the EU is falling short in its pledge to provide Ukraine with one million rounds of artillery ammunition by March 2024 and amid stalled negotiations over longer-term aid.

The paper says that support for the delivery of weapons would continue to be provided through the so-called European Peace Facility, a mechanism that reimburses member states for what they supply Ukraine.

However, an initial EU plan to put aside €20 billion ($21.8 billion) over four years to pay for weapons for Kyiv risks unraveling because some member states, including Germany, couldn’t agree on the terms, according to an EU diplomat.

Instead, member states are hoping to at least agree to €5 billion for next year with commitments for continued support to follow thereafter, said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

EU leaders are expected to discuss at a summit in December a European Commission recommendation to formally open membership talks with Ukraine.

Separately, Hungary has also been blocking the various streams of support as it wants the EU to first have a discussion about its overall Ukraine strategy, another diplomat said."

Moldovan President Maia Sandu, European Council President Charles Michel and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius arrived in Kyiv on Nov. 21 on the occasion of the Day of Dignity and Freedom, the Ukrainian holiday marking the start of the EuroMaidan protests and the Orange Revolution.

""I am absolutely convinced that our future will be safer with Ukraine within the European Union,"" European Council President Charles Michel said during a meeting in Kyiv with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Moldovan President Maia Sandu on Nov. 21.

Ukrainians ""are fighting for our common values"" and ""our common future,"" Michel said.

Addressing the people of Ukraine and Moldova, he said that their respective presidents ""made a very clear and strategic choice"" when deciding to apply for EU membership.

Michel said that ""it is our moral duty and also our strategic responsibility to do everything to deliver"" on this choice.

EuroMaidan is ""a landmark in our shared European history"" Michel said during a joint press conference with Sandu and Zelensky.

The message that Ukrainians are Europeans ""is guiding Ukraine through its challenges and also toward a better future.""

""Speaking with one voice, we become stronger and more resilient,"" Sandu wrote in a caption of photo of the press conference on X.

Sandu, President Volodymyr Zelensky, and First Lady Olena Zelenska paid their respects together to the more than 100 people killed in the 2013-2014 EuroMaidan Revolution.

The Day of Dignity and Freedom was established by presidential decree in 2014. Ukraine celebrates the 10th anniversary of the EuroMaidan and the 19th anniversary of the Orange Revolution this year.

In addition, Sandu said she planned to meet with Michel and Zelensky to discuss the next steps of Moldova and Ukraine's accession to the EU, improving regional security, and the EU's support for reforms and development in the respective countries.

Pistorius made an unannounced visit to Kyiv, the Defense Ministry reported on Nov. 21.

Pistorius is in Kyiv to ""personally see the current situation and the effectiveness of German support,"" the ministry wrote.

Shortly after arrival, Pistorius visited a memorial to the EuroMaidan revolution and laid flowers to commemorate those killed, marking the 10th anniversary of the day when the revolution started.

The EuroMaidan Revolution began in November 2013, when pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign the long-awaited Association Agreement with the European Union, shortly thereafter receiving a loan from the Kremlin.

The government moved against the revolution in a violent crackdown, which resulted in over 100 protesters killed who are now commemorated in Ukraine as the ""Heavenly Hundred.""

The protests culminated in February 2014 with Yanukovych and other high-ranking officials fleeing to Russia and being replaced by a pro-Western interim government.

Zelensky commented on Ukraine's progress in its fight for freedom and European integration since the EuroMaidan protests.

""Year after year, step by step, we do everything to ensure that our star shines in the circle of stars on the EU flag, which symbolizes the unity of the peoples of Europe,"" Zelensky said.

""Twenty years ago, it was a romantic dream, 10 years ago, it was an ambitious goal, and today, it is a reality in which it is no longer possible to stop our progress.""

He expressed confidence in Ukraine's future in the European Union despite the war and all the tragedies that have befallen the country in the past 10 years, especially since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion.

""Years and centuries from now, when (hearing) about Ukraine as an integral part of Europe, all future generations will ask in schools: how could it have been otherwise?""

Ingrida Simonyte, the Prime Minister of Lithuania, also marked the holiday, saying, that ""without Ukraine, the EU family is incomplete.""

""The future of Ukraine is in the European Union. The future that the Maidan fought for has finally begun,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a post about the holiday.

Germany will provide Ukraine with another military aid package worth 1.3 billion euros ($1.42 billion), Pistorius said during his visit to Kyiv.

The tranche will include four IRIS-T SLM air defense systems, 20,000 155mm shells, and anti-tank mines, Pistorius said during a press conference with his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov.

""I am sure this will help you in your fight against Russian aggression. This underlines that we stand with Ukraine sustainably and reliably,"" Pistorius commented.

The artillery shells come on top of 140,000 155mm rounds Germany pledged to deliver in 2024, the German defense minister noted.

When asked about the possible delivery of the much-desired Taurus long-range missiles, Pistorius replied that there is no new information on Taurus.

According to Deutsche Welle, citing AFP, the trip's main purpose was to discuss training programs for Ukrainian soldiers and Germany's continuing military aid for Ukraine.

It was Pistorius' second visit to Kyiv since he became defense minister in January 2023.

Pistorius' arrival in Kyiv came one day after another unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Germany is the world's second-biggest provider of military aid to Ukraine after the U.S.

At least 10,000 civilians have been killed, and over 18,500 have been injured since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said on Nov. 21.

The figure of 10,000, which includes over 560 children, consists of civilian deaths verified according to UN methodology.

The HRMMU noted that the actual number of those killed and injured is likely to be significantly higher.

Between August and October, nearly half of civilian casualties were recorded ""far away from the front lines,"" the monitoring mission's head Danielle Bell, said.

""No place in Ukraine is completely safe.""

The same period saw 86% of civilian casualties being recorded in territories of Ukraine under Kyiv's control.

""The vast majority were caused by explosive weapons with wide area effect,"" such as artillery shells, missiles, and cluster munitions, according to the HRMMU.

There is also a disproportionate representation of older people among the casualty figures, as they are often unable to relocate to safer areas.

""The Russian Federation's war against Ukraine, now entering into its 21st month, risks evolving into a protracted conflict, with the severe human cost being painful to fathom,"" Bell said.

UN Human Rights chief Volker Turk said on March 31 that the number of civilian casualties resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine far outstrips official figures.

""These figures are just the tip of the iceberg,"" Turk said during a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

ABC News: US shell deliveries to Ukraine have dropped over 30% since Hamas' Oct 7 attack

The U.S.'s deliveries of NATO-standard 155mm shells to Ukraine have decreased ""by more than 30%"" since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict on Oct. 7, an unnamed Ukrainian official told ABC News on Nov. 21.

""They (U.S. officials) were telling us it (the Israel-Hamas war) wouldn’t influence the commitments (from the U.S.), but it did,"" the official said.

However, an unnamed senior U.S. defense official disputed that connection, saying to ABC News that the reduction in shell provisions has ""absolutely nothing to do with what's happening in Gaza.""

According to the U.S. official, the U.S. presidential drawdown authority packages ""start to get put together weeks in advance, so there is no link between what's happening in Gaza to what’s happening in Ukraine.""

It is not the first time that such a connection has been drawn.

President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed the assessment, saying on Nov. 16 that the delivery of shells from Western allies had ""really slowed down"" since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict.

""Let’s be frank: the crisis in the Middle East is already having a lasting impact on our policy in Ukraine,"" said Josep Borrell, the EU's top diplomat, in a speech on Nov. 6.

Russian attacks in Kherson and Kharkiv oblasts killed at least three people and injured another four in the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 21.

Russian forces hit a residential building in Kherson on the morning of Nov. 21, leaving a 59-year-old man with a leg injury, the Kherson Oblast Military Administration said on Telegram.

1141690990,20231121,"SHAFAQNA– In visiting “Thomas Siler”, the European Union’s Ambassador in Baghdad, “Seyyed Ammar Al-Hakim”, Head of the National Wisdom Movement in Iraq emphasized the necessity of continuing cooperation in bilateral common arenas and strengthening of relations.

According to Shafaqna from media office of Iraq’s National Wisdom Movement in Iran, in this visit that took place in the office of the head of Iraq’s National Wisdom Movement in Baghdad, Al-Hakim expressed his satisfaction with Iraq’s joining the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and believed that it is a step in the proper direction which helps further integration of Iraq into the international system.

Hakim demanded to utilize promising opportunities that Iraq offers in development and service sectors, and in this regard, stressed the importance of the development path project as a major project connecting East to West.

Hakim also emphasized the necessity to end the brutal attacks on helpless Palestinians and called for an immediate ceasefire and arrival of humanitarian aid and return of the necessities of life in the Gaza Strip and starting reconstruction of cities.

Al-Hakim asked the international community to fulfill its responsibility to revive the concepts that are completely collapsing due to double standards regarding Gaza issues."
1141694873,20231121,"ROME — The Italian Chamber of Deputies voted on Nov. 16 to pass a law that would ban the marketing and production of cultivated meat in the country. The plan was already approved by the Italian Senate.

The legislation states that companies that work with cultivated meats could face fines between 10,000 and 60,000 Euros for each violation.

“Defense of health, of the Italian production system, of thousands of jobs, of our culture and tradition,” said Francesco Lollobrigida, Italy’s agriculture minister. “With the law approved today, Italy is the first nation in the world that is safe from the social and economic risks of synthetic food.”

Another part of the proposed laws said that companies cannot use meat-related names like ‘salami’ or ‘steak’ for plant-based products, according to the proposal.

The Good Food Institute (GFI) of Europe trade group that advocates for meat alternatives, came out against the proposed measure by the Italian government.

“This bill not only deprives consumers of choice but also isolates Italy from the investment and job creation offered by this burgeoning industry,” said Francesca Gallelli, public affair consultant at GFI Europe. “We welcome the intention of the government to submit the law to the EU scrutiny, and we hope member states can voice their concerns regarding its potential violation of the single market.”

As of September, the European Union has not approved any measures involving cultivated meat and it is not allowed to be sold on the continent.

Cultivated meat products have been approved in Singapore and the United States."

A robust level of management support must be provided by the successful Supplier to ensure that the detailed specification is delivered within the contract on a consistent basis within the contract period.

A suitable support structure must be available to ensure that absences are covered at all times, providing minimal impact to the day to day cleaning of the premises.

1141708053,20231121,"Where did you follow the OpenAI drama over the weekend?

For most people, the chaos of former OpenAI CEO unfolded — and is still unfolding — .

For all the controversy around the platform formerly known as Twitter, it’s still as central to conversations in Silicon Valley as it was in its early days. (You could argue that Elon Musk’s takeover has performed a sort of , returning it to an early-Obama-era Wild West feel and laser focus on internecine techie politics.)

But the collision of Musk’s Twitter takeover and the chaos at OpenAI reveals something even bigger than social media’s shifting tectonic plates — the extent of the society-shaping power wielded by a very small cadre of Silicon Valley titans.

One of Sam Altman’s co-founders at OpenAI was, after all… Elon Musk. Musk turned his back on the project because of a over their progress compared to Google DeepMind, as well as his own personal beliefs about AI development, and has now launched his own AI venture .

Meanwhile, Greg Brockman, the OpenAI president ousted alongside Altman, was the first CTO of Stripe, which raised early money from Musk and fellow OpenAI co-founder Peter Thiel. Musk also tried using his huge account on X to in the OpenAI drama this weekend, tweeting directly at board member and the company’s chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, someone he says “has a good moral compass and does not seek power.”

And if you think OpenAI’s governance shakeup is a chance to shake off these ties, think again. New OpenAI CEO Emmett Shear is a at Y Combinator, the startup accelerator where Sam Altman once was president. It still serves as a Silicon Valley business and social hub, and two of its co-founders were Jessica Livingston and Trevor Blackwell, also — you guessed it — OpenAI co-founders. Still following?

With “how to govern AI” still topic A in the Washington policy space (or close to it), the blowup at the most high-profile AI company shines a light on a particularly thorny challenge for regulators trying to shape the future.

Individual personalities — and individual fortunes — matter far more in the world of Silicon Valley startups than they do in corporate America’s more consensus-oriented, traditional bureaucracies. Once, industrial names like Morgan or Rockefeller or Ford drove national policy from their boardroom chairs, a version of America we might have thought we’ve put to rest. Not in tech: Today we take it for granted that Bezos, Zuckerberg and Musk are more or less synonymous with their corporate empires. (Perhaps blame Steve Jobs, the charismatic Apple founder and world-shaper who over them all in the mind of business builders.)

Big organizations move slowly, and respond to rules. Startup titans, not so much. It’s extremely difficult to imagine more established tech giants like IBM or Microsoft changing their business model on a personal whim or passion, like with Musk’s free speech crusade for Twitter, or Mark Zuckerberg’s sudden commitment to the metaverse, or Altman’s belief in .

OpenAI, in particular, was intended to serve a greater mission under its , but it’s become clear just how much the company is shaped by a single person, its ousted CEO. Samuel Hammond, a senior economist at the Foundation For American Innovation, and a , calls it a “cultish and borderline messianic employee culture, as shown in their willingness to all ,” citing that Altman personally interviewed every new hire at the company, a philosophy he once advocated for .

He described to me how Sam Altman’s personal beliefs have come to define the company, and therefore the larger existential debates around the potential existence (and risk) of superhuman “AGI,” or artificial general intelligence.

“Over the last year, Altman reoriented OpenAI to be even more mission driven, changing their core values to emphasize that anything that didn’t advance AGI was ‘out of scope,’” Hammond said.

The lesson for not just America, but humanity writ large, is that a very small group of people have come to wield total, personalized control over many of the systems, whether Musk’s social media platform or Altman’s intelligence machines, that are shaping society’s present and future.

Regulators and critics have proposed strategies for reining in that influence, from the European Union’s to Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan’s to some proposals to .

None have yet succeeded. Personal rule in Silicon Valley had major, well-documented ramifications for the era of startup culture that was dominated by app-based social and connectivity companies like Facebook or Uber. It will have even larger ones in the AI era, where, realistic or not, the discourse is characterized by arguments about the .



Washington’s consumer-protection chiefs are saying “I told you so” over the past week’s chaos at OpenAI.

, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra said Sam Altman’s ouster is a sobering reminder of the massive power a small cadre of tech bigwigs have over society-shaping products. (Ahem.)

“There is a race to develop the foundational AI models. There will probably not be tons of those models. It may in fact be a natural oligopoly,” Chopra said. “The fact that Big Tech companies are now overlapping with the major foundational AI models is adding even more questions about what we do to make sure that they do not have outsized power.”

Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Christy Romero chimed in on how it’s not “quite known what all the risks are” with regard to AI. Chopra, too, warned of the technology’s financial risks, saying its use could “actually lead to very procyclical effects that would magnify tremors into much larger financial quakes.”

The slugfest between Europe’s biggest economies and the European Union over the AI Act is turning potentially deadly for that bill’s prospects.

POLITICO’s Gian Volpicelli , with France, Germany, and Italy arguing that the most powerful AI systems should be exempt from the upcoming law so the bloc might have a better chance of developing its own equivalents to systems like the American-made ChatGPT.

The three countries declaring Europe’s need for a “regulatory framework which fosters innovation and competition, so that European players can emerge and carry our voice and values in the global race of AI,” something one European negotiator told Gian amounts to “a declaration of war.”

Negotiators are now racing to meet a Dec. 6 deadline for the bill’s text, with an upcoming European Parliament election in June 2024 potentially jeopardizing the bill’s chance of passage.

Eamon Gilmore and the Many Traps on His Trip to Cuba

This week, the visit of the special representative of the European Union (EU) for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, is expected in Cuba. The national context in which the official arrives could not be more adverse. In the midst of the most significant mass exodus in recent decades, with more than a thousand political prisoners and a deep economic crisis, the Island will give Josep Borrell’s envoy multiple headaches. The biggest challenge of his trip will be to avoid the daunting agenda that the Havana regime is preparing for him to prevent him from looking towards the most problematic and painful areas of Cuban reality.

Unlike other times, when information trickled out of the country, Gilmore has had at his disposal countless reports, testimonies and articles from the independent press that detail the magnitude of the repression we suffered. He has also been able to meet with exiles who have told him, first-hand, about the forced banishment, the travel ban that weighs on several dissidents, the threats against the families of those convicted of the popular protests of 11 July 2021, and the twist of censorship represented by the new Social Communication Law, already approved and which will soon come into force.

However, it is one thing to read all those alarming reports and listen to the stories of emigrants, and another, very different, to hear the voices of the victims within Cuba and include in the program contact with the most silenced and vulnerable part of our society. On the Island, Gilmore will be another guest at the Plaza de la Revolución and will have to adhere to official protocol, which translates into the need to condemn the US embargo, praise public services — even if they only take him to schools and hospitals carefully ‘made up’ for the occasion — and to proclaim the “solid ties” of collaboration between the European Union and Havana.

But someone who protects Human Rights should go further, escape from the symbolic gestures and red carpets to delve into what ails and frightens a society. If he follows a program in line with his position, Gilmore would not be able to avoid visiting at least one Cuban prison. Immersing himself in this underworld is vital to understanding the total absence of physical and legal guarantees that afflicts the prisoners. Speaking directly with political prisoners and their families would be vital to understanding what is happening on this island.

If the official also used the internet connection offered by the state telecommunications monopoly, Etecsa, during his stay, he could see for himself the dozens of blocked digital sites, especially those that offer national news without complying with the editorial guidelines of the Communist Party. A walk through the Cuban fields, not to the farms decorated for the eyes of international organizations, but to those of farmers who cannot even buy wire for their fences because agricultural inputs are sold only in foreign currency, would add nuances to his conclusions.

His could not miss on his trip the crowded airport hall where hundreds of men, most of them young and with light luggage, are preparing to board a plane to Managua to begin the migratory route. The failure of the model imposed more than six decades ago is summarized in those Cubans who leave seeking economic improvements and freedoms.

To the list of actions, Gilmore could add the surprise arrival at a ration market with its many flies and few products, in addition to the emergence of one of those businesses, which have appeared everywhere, where the price for thirty eggs is equivalent to one monthly salary. To top it off, a walk through a neighborhood on the outskirts of Havana is recommended, full of people “illegal” in their own country, lacking drinking water service and opportunities.

All this and more would give the special representative of the European Union for Human Rights a complete and realistic vision of what we Cubans are experiencing. But between the traps of the official agenda and the timorous European diplomacy, it is possible to foresee that Gilmore’s visit will remain just one more, without ramifications for our citizens. After all, he is only in office for a brief period and the Cuban regime surpasses him with its 64 years of repressive experience.

1141710102,20231121,"Any major project connected to Iraq’s oil and gas sector has an incalculably greater significance than just extracting oil or gas. Situated in the heart of the Middle East, sharing its eastern border with Iran, its northern border with Turkey, its western border with Syria and Jordan, and its southern border with Saudi Arabia, Iraq is perhaps the single most geopolitically important country to Russia, China, and the U.S. in the entire region. In turn, the lawless western desert province of Anbar is perhaps the most geopolitically vital area in all of Iraq. And the most strategically important position in Anbar is the huge Akkas gas field. It is little wonder, then, that Russia and China have been angling for the best position to benefit from Iraq’s sixth gas licensing round, centre stage of which will be the bidding for the giant Akkas gas field and its surrounding area.

The field itself has around 5.6 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves, and Iraq’s Oil Ministry plans for it to produce around 400 million cubic feet per day of gas. But that is not the point at all – it could have nothing in it, and Russia and China would still do anything to get it. One core reason is that oil and gas companies are legally entitled to secure their oil and/or gas field operations around the world through whatever means they feel necessary. In practical terms, this can include stationing a massive heavily-armed security force around an oil and/or gas field. Such a site can also house anyone else that the company wishes, in whatever job function they care to label them. In China’s case, this link between the corporate world and the state is explicit. For the many national-level state firms (and virtually all others), board directors and company executives are under the standing instruction to ‘execute the will of the Central Committee of the China Communist Party’. A similar directive applies to Russian state companies. In the West, the links between the corporate world and the state are much less direct. In sum, though, the outcome is largely the same: an oil and/or gas field exploration and development site anywhere in the world can effectively be regarded as part of the country of the company that operates it, not as part of the country in which it is geographically situated.

For China, then, a growing presence in Iraq brings several significant advantages to its overarching plan to act as - at least - the global superpower counterpoint to the U.S. One of these, as reiterated recently in the Iraq Cabinet meeting that gave its full support to rolling out all aspects of the ‘Iraq-China Framework Agreement’ signed in December 2021, is plentiful cheap oil, gas, and petrochemicals. This agreement is very similar in scope and scale to the all-encompassing ‘Iran-China 25-Year Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement’, as first revealed anywhere in the world in my 3 September 2019 article on the subject and fully examined in my new book on the new global oil market order. A key part of both deals is that China has first refusal on all oil, gas, and petrochemicals projects that come up in Iraq for the duration of the deal, and that it is given at least a 30 percent discount on all oil, gas, and petrochemicals it buys. Another key part of the Iraq-China Framework Agreement is that Beijing is allowed to build factories across the country, with a corollary build-out of supportive infrastructure. This includes - importantly for its ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ – railway and other transport and logistical links, all overseen by its own management staff from Chinese companies on the ground in Iraq.

For Russia, the stakes are even higher. Iraq – under the enduring influence of Iran – is a key part of the Shia Crescent countries over which Moscow extends its influence across the Middle East, as also analysed in depth in my new book. This augments the geopolitical power it wields in and around its Former Soviet Union (FSU) satellite states. Already in a controlling position in all key countries in the Shia Crescent of power in the Middle East – Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen (via Iran) – Russia continues to work on those countries on the edges of the Crescent in which it already directly or indirectly had a foothold. These include Azerbaijan (75% Shia and an FSU state) and Turkey (25% Shia and furious at not being accepted fully into the European Union). Others also remain longer-term targets, including Bahrain (75% Shia) and Pakistan (up to 25% Shia and previously a sanctuary to sworn-U.S. enemies Al Qaeda and the Taliban). Iraq is the vital link for Russia, then, between Iran (over which it has significant control, along with China) and Syria - the biggest country on the western side of the Shia Crescent.

The Akkas gas field itself is one of three big gas fields that form a skewed triangle across southern Iraq, stretching from the Mansuriya field near the eastern border with Iran, down to Siba field in the south (extremely close to the key Iraqi Basra export hub), and then all the way west across to Akkas itself (extremely close to the border with Syria). Russia thought it had finally gained control over these three sites when in September 2019 its Stroytransgaz signed a preliminary contract with Iraq’s Oil Ministry to develop the hitherto virtually unknown Block 17 in Iraq’s lawless wasteland Anbar province, as also analysed in depth in my new book. A place so violent and unpredictable that it was even avoided where possible by Islamic State, the Block 17 site in Anbar province was perfect for Russia’s purposes, as it was right in the middle of what the U.S. military used to call ‘the spine’ of Islamic State where the Euphrates flows westwards into Syria and eastwards into the Persian Gulf, extremely close to the border with Iran.

Along the spine running from east to west are the historical ultra-nationalist and ultra-anti-West cities of Falluja, Ramadi, Hit and Haditha, and then Iraq turns into Syria, and it is just a short hop to the key strategic ports of Banias and Tartus, and to Latakia – all three of which are crucial globally strategic sites for Moscow. The Syrian port of Tartus remains a huge naval base for Russia and the only Mediterranean port it has access to. The port is just a short ride from Khmeimim airport, which – under a deal struck in 2015 - became a dual-use civilian-military airport-airbase for use by Russia. And just a short flight away from those two key assets is Russia’s Latakia intelligence-gathering listening station. Meanwhile, Banias had long been earmarked as the end point for the long-planned Iran-Iraq-Syria pipelines that would move Iranian, and later Iraqi, oil and gas from Iran through Iraq to Syria, and then into the less rigorously policed ports of southern Europe. This route would not only allow for the movement of sanctioned Iranian oil and gas into Europe, but also of anything else that Russia and Iran want to get into the continent without too many checks. This has long been the final part of Russian and Iranian plans to build a ‘land bridge’ from Tehran to the Mediterranean Sea by which they could exponentially increase the scale and scope of weapons delivery into southern Lebanon and the Golan Heights area of Syria to be used in attacks on Israel, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. This core aim of this policy was to provoke a broader conflict in the Middle East that would draw in the U.S. and its allies into an unwinnable war of the sort seen recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.

It should come as no surprise, then, that – according to a source who works closely with Iraq’s Oil Ministry spoken to exclusively by OilPrice.com last week – Russia has now received assurances from the Iraqi government that it will be awarded an exploratory and production licence for the Akkas gas field. The enormous pressure that Russia brought to bear on Baghdad, both through its activities in the south of the country and through its tight grip over Kurdistan’s oil and gas sector in the north, was augmented by heavy lobbying of Iraq’s Oil Ministry from elements of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, added the source. “So the Russian licence will allow its chosen companies to subcontract parts of the contract for periods of 5-10 years during the 20-year licence period, and this will heavily feature Chinese companies,” he concluded.

1141730129,20231122,"It has been 10 years since the start of the uprising known as Maidan, or the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine. The wave of civil unrest was sparked by the Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to not sign an association agreement with the European Union, which set off a three-month resistance movement.

1141751773,20231122,"Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is testing limits of US and European support for Israel’s war on Gaza.

Cracks in Western support have emerged not only because of the devastating human toll of Israel’s military campaign, including stepped-up attacks on hospitals and schools, but also due to differences on how Gaza would be governed once the guns fall silent.

Mr. Netanyahu has yet to outline his vision of an interim Gaza administration beyond stating that Israel would retain security control for an “indefinite” period to ensure that the Strip does not re-emerge as a threat but would not re-occupy Gaza or shoulder responsibility for the territory’s day-to-day administration. Israel, the United States, and Europe agree that Hamas’ revival is not an option.

Quietly so do some Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

However, that is where the agreement between Israel and its Western backers ends.

In contrast to the United States and the European Union that insist on the West Bank’s Palestine Authority taking control of Gaza, Mr. Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the entity created under the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian Oslo accords.

Yet, even if Israel and the West were on the same page about this, getting from A to B is fraught with multiple problems.

For one, none of the multiple options under discussion for the day after in Gaza, ranging from the Palestine Authority or Egypt taking control to a United Nations mandate, an Arab force moving into Gaza, to Israeli occupation or the expulsion of Gazans from the territory, take Palestinian concerns into consideration.

With Palestinian attitudes hardening as a result of the Israeli assault, any post-war interim arrangement that fails to hold out credible hope for an end to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the siege of Gaza and a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is likely to be fragile at best.

A recent post-October 7 poll of Palestinian public opinion in the West Bank and Gaza conducted by Ramallah-based Arab World for Research and Development (AWRAD) does not bode well for arrangements that disregard Palestinian aspirations.

More than 80 per cent of those surveyed said their confidence in a peaceful resolution of the conflict had decreased. More than 60 per cent said their faith in a two-state solution, involving the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, had diminished.

More than 70 per cent indicated their support for a state in all of historic Palestine had increased. Almost 90 per cent said their confidence in Palestinian-Israeli peaceful coexistence had dropped. Seventy-four per cent supported Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack that killed 1,200, mostly civilian, Israelis.

Seventy-five percent described Hamas’ overall role as positive. Eight-three per cent said the same about Islamic Jihad, a Gaza-based militant group and 88 per cent were positive about Hamas’ military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.

Seventy-two per cent favour a post-war national unity government in the West Bank and Gaza. While not explicitly asked, it is a fair assumption that those surveyed envisioned Hamas as part of such a government.

Beyond Palestinian public opinion being at odds with post-war options under discussion, the Palestine Authority under President Mahmoud Abbas’ leadership has little, if any, credibility in the West Bank and Gaza.

Ninety-five per cent of Gazans surveyed and 88 per cent in the West Bank judged the Palestine Authority’s role negatively.

Western leaders have suggested that reform of the Authority, widely seen as ineffective and corrupt, would be a pre-requisite for it to take control of Gaza.

However, it remains unclear how reform would be implemented.

Leaving practical difficulties aside, Israel and the West are likely to oppose an election that could be won by Hamas or a group that stands for Hamas’ principles that emphasise armed struggle and, at best, a long-term ceasefire between Israel and a Palestinian state but no recognition of the Jewish state or peace treaty.

In addition, there are no immediate unproblematic candidates to succeed Mr. Abbas. Marwan Barghouti, the most popular candidate long touted as a successor, is serving five cumulative life sentences for murder in an Israeli prison.

It is unlikely that Israel would support positioning Mr. Barghouti as a successor, even though he potentially could be released from prison in an exchange of Israeli military personnel captured by Hamas on October 7 and held hostage in Gaza.

Israel accuses Mr. Barghouti of founding the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, a coalition of Palestinian armed groups in the West Bank.

In 2006, Mr. Barghouti authored from prison a National Conciliation Document of the Prisoners that was co-signed by Hamas. The document endorsed Palestinians’ right to resist Israeli occupation, implicitly including armed resistance, while appearing to envision a two-state solution.

Equally problematic is the possible candidacy of Abu Dhabi-based Mohammed Dahlan, a UAE-backed Gazan and former Al Fatah Palestinian security chief in Gaza who was convicted in absentia in a West Bank court on corruption charges. It’s unclear whether Mr. Dahlan, who has been tacitly positioning himself in recent weeks, has a support base in Gaza or The West Bank.

Moreover, persuading the Palestine Authority or Arab states to get involved in Gaza’s post-war administration and reconstruction is easier said than done. Neither the Authority nor Arab states are willing to engage without a viable prospect for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Recent US and European statements emphasising a two-state solution are widely considered across the Middle East as empty declarations without evidence of a willingness to force Israel to the negotiating table and elicit the policy changes that would make a resolution viable.

Even if the United States, the power potentially capable of forcing Israel’s hand, were willing to pressure Israel in much the same way that President Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted in the 1950s “a resolution which would call on all United Nations members to suspend not just governmental but private assistance to Israel,” it would require a political change in Israel with no guarantee that a new government would be more pliable.

Mr. Netanyahu’s political days may be numbered with a majority of Israelis holding him responsible for Israel’s intelligence and military failure in anticipating and preventing Hamas’ October 7 attack.

Proponents of a two-state solution expect that Mr. Netanyahu’s post-war downfall would remove from power ultra-nationalists and ultra-conservatives, with whom no constructive engagement is possible.

The problem is that changing the Israeli government is unlikely to be a panacea.

Benny Gantz, a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s war cabinet, who is touted as the prime minister’s possible successor, has ruled out a return to Israel’s pre-1967 borders and insisted that Palestinians should have an “entity” but not a state.

Ram Ben Barak, a former senior intelligence official and contender for leadership of Yesh Atid, Israel’s main opposition party, illustrated just how deep and widespread Israeli anti-Palestinian sentiment is by calling for the disbursement of Gaza’s population to the four corners of the world.

In a Wall Street Journal oped entitled ‘The West Should Welcome Gaza Refugees,’ Mr. Ben Barak and Likud Knesset member Danny Danon, a former deputy defense minister and ambassador to the United Nations, spelled out the call for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza.

“We simply need a handful of the world’s nations to share the responsibility of hosting Gazan residents. Even if countries took in as few as 10,000 people each, it would help alleviate the crisis,” Messrs. Danon and Ben Barak said.

“The international community has a moral imperative — and an opportunity — to demonstrate compassion, help the people of Gaza move toward a more prosperous future and work together to achieve greater peace and stability in the Middle East,” they added.

Scholars Nathan J. Brown and Amr Hamzawy argued in a recent paper that Arab states could potentially break the deadlock and create an opportunity for US President Joe Biden to balance his support for Israel by putting forward an updated version of the Arab peace plan drafted in 2002.

The plan called for normalisation of relations with Israel in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967 and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital alongside the Jewish state.

“Recent history has shown that heightened attention to Israel and Palestine during phases of intense violence and human suffering could produce unexpected multilateral efforts to push forward conflict resolution measures and peaceful settlements,” Messrs. Brown and Hamzawy said.

The scholars suggested the Arab peace plan should be bolstered by a set of principles that recognise that:
• Palestinian and Jewish national identities are legitimate and need institutional expression.
• individual human rights as well as national communities’ rights need protection.
• anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, and racist rhetoric and actions must be explicitly and unconditionally repudiated by all actors.
• any targeting of civilians should be actively combated by all parties to the negotiation process.
• settlement activities in the Palestinian territories and forced displacement of Palestinians to Egypt, Jordan, or anywhere else is an outlawed action all parties commit to fight against.
• full diplomatic, political, and economic relations among participating states should be an outcome of the process.
• no stateless people should be left behind at the conclusion of any set of agreements.

With Arab and Muslim foreign ministers visiting the capitals of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, one way of updating the Arab peace initiative would be to enshrine a reworked plan in a Council resolution. The ministers kicked off their tour in Beijing, this month’s Council chair. Permanent members would find it difficult to veto adoption of an initiative that reflects principles they have all endorsed.

“Washington seems desperate for realistic ideas and may, along with its European allies, react to…the suggestions listed here less allergically if they are coupled with an offer of regional relations among its various partners,” Messrs Brown and Hamzawy suggested.

So far, Washington appears to be missing opportunities rather than looking for openings.

In Jerusalem this week, Mr. Biden’s energy security advisor, Amos Hochstein, explored creating revenue streams for a post-war Gaza administration, including the development of a gas field off the Strip’s shore.

Mr. Hochstein discussed the proposal with Israeli officials, failing to involve the Palestine Authority."

 Known as the Samoa Agreement, it marked the era of cooperation. Representatives from OACPS and the EU convened in Apia, Samoa, on Nov 15.

 The Samoa Agreement had succeeded the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, which expired in 2020, and would serve as the new legal framework for the next 20 years between EU and the 47 African, 16 Caribbean and 15 Pacific countries, and the Republic of Maldives.

 Fisheries and Marine Resources Minister Jelta Wong represented the country at the event and delivered the regional statement representing the Pacific-ACP (PACP) member countries.

 Wong said: “The opening for signature of the Samoa Agreement signifies the beginning of a new era in the OACPS-EU relations.

 “It also serves as testament to our long-standing, enduring partnership that has spanned almost half a century. A partnership that brings two significant groupings of countries together. Our Blue Pacific region welcomes the renewed OACPS-EU Partnership and the joint commitments to address our unique regional challenges and vulnerabilities.

 “This historical event provides the opportunity to highlight the interlinkages of key partnerships and modalities of development, for realisation of our collective ambition under the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.”

 The Samoa Agreement sees a renewed partnership and strengthen the capacity of the EU and OACP States to collaborate on a range of critical issues, including democracy and human rights, sustainable economic growth and development, climate change, human and social development, peace and security, migration and mobility.

 The EU remained one of PNG’s biggest development partners with an estimated investment portfolio to be more than K3 billion under the past Cotonou Agreement.

 The new Samoa Agreement was a significant milestone for PNG as it would enhance the ties with the EU and was expected to increase the EU’s investment portfolio in PNG to over K4 billion.

 It would also support PNG’s priority developments."
1141755743,20231122,"(Bloomberg) -- China exported small amounts of two minerals crucial to high-tech manufacturing in October, marking a resumption in sales after a two-month hiatus caused by Beijing’s restrictions.

The controls on germanium, gallium and their chemical compounds, used to make parts for chips, telecommunications equipment and electric vehicles, were imposed on Aug. 1 on national security grounds, as China escalated its tit-for-tat trade war with the US and Europe. Another set of export controls on graphite, a key material for EV batteries, is due to come into force on Dec. 1.

For germanium and gallium, Chinese exporters are now required to apply for licenses from the government and report details on their overseas customers and how the metals are used.

After almost zero exports were recorded in August and September, tiny quantities were posted for October, according to the latest Chinese customs data. For germanium, exports were 0.65 tons, compared to 8.78 tons in July. For gallium, they were 0.25 tons, versus 7.58 tons in July.

For the whole of 2022, China exported 44 tons of germanium and 94 tons of gallium.

China is the world’s biggest importer of commodities because its consumption of energy, metals and grains far outstrips its domestic output. But in one corner of raw materials markets — critical minerals used by the world’s high-tech industries — it holds an outsized advantage in terms of production and processing capacity.

That’s proved to be a useful counter in China’s trade disputes over the years, but it’s also forced dependent economies like the US and its allies to seek new sources of the minerals and “de-risk” their supply chains.

While the strained relationship with Washington has shown some improvement after presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden met in San Francisco last week, how that plays out in terms of competition on technology remains uncertain.

The US continues to hinder China’s ability to secure advanced chips for computer processing as well as export its solar panels. The European Union has also launched an anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EVs.

China’s looming graphite curbs aren’t as significant as they could’ve been, according to a note from BloombergNEF, because they “target natural graphite products rather than the synthetic ones that account for the bulk of Chinese exports.” Still, the move could push top importers like South Korea, the US and EU to develop alternative sources, BNEF said.

China’s exports of graphite that will be subject to the controls have averaged about 17,000 tons a month this year, according to customs data. By comparison, exports of synthetic graphite have averaged 47,000 tons.

The restrictions highlight “the uncertainty in the market moving forward,” said Chris Burns, chief executive officer of Australian battery materials company Novonix Ltd. Although the immediate impact isn’t yet clear, the curbs could cause “slightly longer lead times to get exported material from China,” he said.

A rally in iron ore took a breather as speculation swirled that China may step up moves to cool a recent advance to a nine-month high.

The gains in Chinese developers’ bonds and stocks Tuesday are at risk of becoming yet another false dawn as investors seem unconvinced that Beijing’s latest funding plan for 50 real estate firms can help turnaround the embattled property sector.

1141759671,20231122,"European Union (EU) in collaboration with the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistant (International IDEA) is to spend about N26,937,019,173.00 (€30 million) on strengthening the rule of law and anti-corruption (RoLAC) sectors in Nigeria.

It was gathered that the new project followed the successful execution of the first project.

The €30 million which would be spent on social justice will cover the period of 2023-2027.

Speaking during the launch of the RoLAC phase II, the Head of Programme, Nigeria International IDEA, Mr Danladi Plang, said democratic governance and the rule of law are the bedrock of the European Union and its role in the world.

“A community of 27 countries and over 400 million people based on the rule of law and on shared fundamental values: the European Union is a unique space of peace, social progress and shared prosperity.

“Over 200 projects and initiatives are currently funded by the EU around the world to promote democratic governance and-the rule of law and benefit-the most vulnerable in the society.

“Fight against corruption is an essential part of these efforts,” Plang said while explaining why the EU and the International IDEA are supporting the anti-corruption fight in Nigeria.

“Corruption is a challenge in Nigeria, and indeed in many countries of the world, as it undermines good governance and human rights, and contributes to poverty. It is proven that corruption undermines the foundations of democratic institutions and represents a major barrier to social and economic growth.

“Corruption weakens the trust of citizens in democratic institutions and indeed threatens stability. Corruption varies in nature and extent, but it affects all countries.

“The fight against corruption is therefore a fundamental part of the EU agenda, internally and externally, and is a priority in our engagement with partner countries.

“The European Union has supported Nigeria’s anti-corruption efforts since 2005, contributing a total of 88 million euros through three successive and successful programmes.

“These programmes have been locally driven, and aimed at strengthening evidence-based policymaking and people-oriented service delivery. They also aimed at creating a culture of transparency and accountability.

“They have supported Nigerian civil society to further enhance its role as watchdog, providing the skills that will help hold the Government to account and to ensure that corruption does not remain business as usual.

“The European Union is committed to continuing to support the Government in its policies and actions against corruption. Nigeria has a robust legal, regulatory and institutional framework to adequately address corruption and illicit activities,” Plang said, adding that €30 million has been earmarked for the project in the next four years.

The executive director, International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistant, Fiona Rowley, said money voted for RoLAC is to strengthen the rule of law and anti-corruption programmes.

She said the programme will help Nigeria to achieve the SDGs and national plans adding that they will want the partners to support them for the programme implementation.

Also, Ambassador and Head of Delegation, Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Samuela Isopi, said 1.5 million people in Nigeria have benefited from the RoLAC programmes which is strengthening institutions especially the fight against corruption, creating access to justice, and ensuring justice to sexual victims.

She said their activities also helped the states to adopt the child rights and other laws.

The minister of economic planning, Senator Atiku Abubakar Bagudu, and the attorney-general of the federation and minister of justice, Mr Lateef Olasunkanmi Fagbemi, in their separate speeches said they will support the project to succeed, adding that the phase I of the project was a success."

1141772146,20231122,"(MENAFN- UkrinForm) The European Union highly appreciates Ukraine's steadfast efforts aimed at restoring agricultural exports, including by organizing the second international summit on food security, which will be held on November 25.

This was stated at the UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday by EU Permanent Representative to the UN Olof Skoog, Ukrinform's own correspondent reports.

According to the permanent representative, the successful creation of the ""Ukrainian corridor"" for civilian cargo vessels enabled Ukraine to export more than 1.5 million tons of food, thereby contributing to the strengthening of global food security.

The European Union also praises the efforts by Ukraine and the private sector“to put in place an insurance scheme that reduces the cost of this route,"" he added.

Through Ukraine's own Grain from Ukraine program, more than 170,000 tons of grain went to countries that need it, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, Skoog said.

""The EU supports all efforts, including those of the UN, to facilitate exports of Ukraine's grain and other agricultural products to the countries most in need, notably in Africa and the Middle East,"" he said.

The EU will continue to expand the possibilities of the Solidarity Lanes initiative to promote Ukrainian grain transit and export via land routes to world markets. They have already made it possible to export more than 57 million tons of Ukrainian agricultural products, Skoog said.

He emphasized that Russia's deliberate shelling of civilian infrastructure and civilians in Ukraine adds to the“growing evidence of war crimes, as reported by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine”.

Russia and its leadership must be held fully accountable for waging a war of aggression against Ukraine and other most serious crimes under international law, the diplomat stressed.

He said the EU would increase assistance for the protection of power generators, power transformers, mobile heating stations, high-voltage and lighting equipment ""to help Ukraine and its people face yet another winter at war."" Through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, the EU has sent more than 5,000 power generators to Ukraine, he said.

In addition, the EU and its member states join Ukraine in commemorating the millions of victims of the Holodomor, Skoog added.

"" If we do not educate ourselves about our history, we risk repeating our mistakes. That is why we support Ukraine's initiative of a joint declaration and we call on all other UN members to support it as well,"" the permanent representative said.

As reported, the Ukrainian delegation to the UN initiated the signing by the member states of the Declaration on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor, which will be made public this week.

On Tuesday, the UN Security Council discussed the situation of Ukraine in connection with the Russian war and its consequences for global food security."
1141778687,20231122,"The European Union (EU) Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS has given one million euros (N847 million) to combat the diphtheria outbreak in the Northeast and Northwest regions of Nigeria.

The bloc, in an attempt to address the disease outbreak in Nigeria, contributed the money to support the most impacted populations and stop the disease’s spread.

In a statement released by the EU Embassy in Abuja, the group made the commitment, stating that the 34 million euros made available in June 2023 will be used by the EU to combat diseases and climate-related issues, among other things.

This amount, according to the statement, is in addition to the 150,000 euros that were previously given to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Disaster Response Emergency amount (DREF) in March 2023 in an attempt to aid in the control of the outbreak.

With this additional EU financing, UNICEF and the medical non-governmental organization, ALIMA, will be able to support frontline health services with staff and technical assistance to improve surveillance and case detection, treat cases, raise community awareness, and help with vaccine procurement.

“Nigeria is currently facing the world’s second-largest diphtheria outbreak with 10,322 confirmed and 16,616 suspected cases since the beginning of the year.

“Kano State represents the outbreak’s epicenter with 8,447 confirmed cases and 589 deaths. The most affected states are Kano, Yobe, Katsina, Borno, Bauchi, and Kaduna which collectively account for 96 percent of all suspected cases.

“In spite of control efforts since the start of the outbreak in late 2022, the disease has gradually spread to other states in the Northwest and Northeast regions.

“Children aged 1 to 14 years are the most affected and they represent 72 per cent of all confirmed cases. Analysis of the vaccination status reveals that over 60 percent of all suspected cases have not been vaccinated,” it said."

This was stated by President of the European Council, Charles Michel, who spoke at a briefing in Kyiv on Tuesday, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

Responding to Ukrinform's question about the expected deadline for the assessment of Ukraine's action plan regarding the Ukraine Facility program that involves EUR 50 billion in assistance, which Ukraine will receive in 2024-2027, Michel stated that he is not aware of the exact date at the moment.

At the same time, he noted the importance of Ukraine having clear commitments to implement decisive reforms,"" said Michel.

He also noted that European officials are“taking care that the recommendations or the conditions expressed by Europe, the United States, and the IMF are consistent”.

""We are trying to clarify, simplify and facilitate the recommendation to make sure that there is a consistent approach,"" said the President of the European Council.

""This is very important in )EU – ed.) enlargement because we advising the United States to stick as much as possible to the recommendations put forward to Ukraine for the EU enlargement so that Ukraine is not trapped where there would be 10 different opinions about the priorities,"" Michel said.

As reported, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday with an unannounced visit.

On November 3, the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, said Ukraine was submitting to the European Commission a tentative action plan for the Ukraine Facility program to the European Commission.

The Ukraine Facility program lays down EUR 50 billion worth of financial assistance, which Ukraine will receive during 2024-2027. The funds will be directed to the public and private sectors of the economy and to budget expenditures."

1141785882,20231122,"Analysis China's State Administration for Market Regulation approved Broadcom's acquisition of VMware, and also revealed it suspended deliberations on the matter on September 25 and only resumed on November 17 – beyond the October 30 date Broadcom set as its target for the deal to close.

That timeline is detailed in the Administration's (SAMR's) decision to allow the deal.

SAMR debated the same issues other antimonopoly regulators around the world had already considered: that VMware dominates the virtualization market, Broadcom does likewise for fibre channel host bus adapters (HBAs), and a combined company could stop certifying third-party adapters to operate with Virtzilla's wares.

Broadcom would therefore be able to milk VMware users and reduce competition.

The acquisition was allowed to proceed on condition Broadcom guarantees ongoing interoperability between VMware software and rivals' hardware – essentially the same requirement demanded by South Korea, the UK, and the European Union.

The Register would argue that Broadcom not allowing VMware's products to work with rivals' hardware would be very stupid given VMware's reputation was built on interoperability, and that dominating the HBA market is not a prize worth the price of a diminished Virtzilla.

Now for the scary part

News that the deal will conclude means attention now turns to how Broadcom will deliver its promised outcomes: increasing VMware's EBITDA, while also spending more on R&D, giving a greater role to VMware's channel, making the virty giant's software easier to implement, and moving customers to subscriptions.

Plus cutting jobs. The Register understands that some US-based VMware employees have already received offers to transfer their employment to Broadcom. Those yet to receive such letters may have been told they cannot expect one in future.

That interpretation of an internal email from outgoing VMware CEO Raghu has not gone down well, given the Thanksgiving holiday falls this week. It's never a good time to be laid off. Seeing the axe swing in your direction ahead of a holiday is doubly nasty.

Outside the US, The Register understands VMware is yet to start the process of informing staff of their options. Rumours suggest the firm's Costa Rica operations are at risk.
• VMware reveals critical vCenter vuln that you may have patched already without knowing it

Speculation about whether Broadcom intends to retain all VMware products can also be found. Broadcom's Symantec acquisition means it already covers plenty of the functions delivered by VMware’s Carbon Black security software unit. End-user computing – VMware’s term for app and desktop virtualization, plus device management – has not grown quickly for years.

VMware's competitors are focusing their efforts on Broadcom's reputation for being unafraid to hike prices and strive for lock-in with large clients.

""If you look at its history, Broadcom's whole business model has been to maximize acquired assets in two to three years,"" Nutanix president and CEO Rajiv Ramaswami told The Register. ""VMware customers will feel this. From their customers to their employees, we're hearing concerns over these changes.""

Bryan Cantrill, co-founder of recently on-prem cloud upstart Oxide also flung a little FUD.

""Customers know what's coming: Broadcom's projected growth in EBITDA from VMware will come out of the hide of their strained IT budgets – and they are actively looking for alternatives,"" he said.

Oxide, like Nutanix, offers its own hypervisor so that customers don't need to run and pay for VMware's ESXi. Microsoft also made its Hyper-V hypervisor very cheap compared to VMware's wares, but that strategy didn't work.

Microsoft's attack was directed at VMware's upswing to market dominance. These attacks on VMware come at a moment when the virtualization giant’s customers are apparently curious about possible alternatives – both because they're leery of Broadcom and (sensibly) because technology has evolved and now presents different alternatives.

Broadcom, however, has bet that VMware will build a strong position for multi-cloud management, and by promising to give VMware's channel more to do appears to be suggesting it wants to support a diverse range of customers.

It's lazy journalism to conclude stories with the observation ""time will tell."" But eighteen months downstream from the shock announcement of Broadcom's plans and there's not much else left to say.

Whatever happens, The Register's virtualization desk will be watching and listening. ®"
1141787800,20231122,"The Delegation of the European Union in Yemen condemned on Tuesday the Iran-backed Houthi militias’ seizure of the Galaxy Leader cargo ship on Sunday.

In a statement, it expressed its ""strong condemnation of the seizure by the Houthis of the Galaxy Leader in the southern Red Sea.""

""Threats to international navigation and maritime security are unacceptable,"" it added, calling for the immediate release of the ship and its crew.

EU citizens are among the crew, it noted.

The Houthis, who have been sending drones and long-range missiles at Israel in solidarity with Hamas, seized the Galaxy Leader cargo ship on Sunday in the southern Red Sea, describing it as Israeli-owned.

White House national security spokesperson John Kirby described on Tuesday the Houthis' seizure as a ""flagrant violation of international law"" in which ""Iran is complicit.""

The Bahamas-flagged car carrier is chartered by Japan's Nippon Yusen. It is owned by a firm registered under Isle of Man-headquartered Ray Car Carriers, which is a unit of Tel Aviv-incorporated Ray Shipping, according to LSEG data.

Iran has denied involvement in the seizure of the ship, which the car carrier's owner on Monday said was taken to the Houthi-controlled southern Yemen port of Hodeidah.

The legitimate Yemeni government condemned the incident, saying it was ""Iranian terrorism by proxy"".

In an official statement on Tuesday, it expressed its ""complete rejection of marine piracy in Yemen’s regional waters that is carried out by the Houthis with the full support of the Iranian regime.""

The incident ""poses a serious threat to marine navigation and international peace and security,"" it added.

Moreover, it warned that the ""Houthis’ terrorist acts by proxy will only deepen the humanitarian crisis endured by the Yemeni people and compound economic burdens.""

It warned that such Houthi attacks will ""serve the interests of foreign powers, including transforming the regional waters into an arena for conflict,"" adding that it would also serve Israel’s expansionist ambitions and embolden armed groups in the region.

The government stressed that the Houthi attacks are a ""natural result of the international community’s failure in deterring these militias that have for years carried out dozens of attacks at sea against cargo vessels, oil installations, national interests and civilian areas in neighboring countries.""

It called on the countries that overlook the Red Sea to act immediately to confront ""Iranian meddling with the security of the region and the freedom of international navigation in one of the world’s most important trade routes."""
1141787802,20231122,"YEREVAN, NOVEMBER 22, ARMENPRESS. The Anti-Corruption Committee of Armenia and Italy’s Guardia di Finanza (Financial Guard) have signed a memorandum of understanding regarding cooperation.

The MoU was signed during Anti-Corruption Committee Chairman Sasun Khachatryan’s visit to Italy within the framework of the European Union’s TAIEX program.

During the visit meetings were held with the leadership of the Guardia di Finanza, the Carabinieri and its special tactical unit, the planning and coordination office of police and the anti-mafia investigative division.

The Armenian delegation studied the experience of these agencies in fighting corruption and organized crime and mechanisms of utilizing modern information technologies, the Anti-Corruption Committee said in a press release. Intelligence operations were also discussed.

Agreements were reached with the Carabinieri General Headquarters and the Guardia di Finanza on organizing trainings for Armenian officers of the Anti-Corruption Committee.

Armenian experience was presented during the meetings. International cooperation in combating corruption was highlighted.

Khachatryan stressed the need for a united fight against corruption because the crime is now a transnational occurrence.

Armenia’s Ambassador to Italy Tsovinar Hambardzumyan also attended the meetings.

The Anti-Corruption Committee of Armenia and Italy’s Guardia di Finanza (Financial Guards) signed a memorandum of understanding regarding cooperation.

The Armenian delegation attached importance to the experience and skills acquired during the visit and expressed hope that cooperation with Italy will enhance.

The representatives of Italian law enforcement agencies expressed readiness to contribute to the development of collegial relations with the Armenian side and implementation of concrete projects on exchange of experience and professional training."

The head of state said that joining the European Union is an important goal for Moldova and Ukraine, to ensure peace and development in our countries.

""It is symbolic that today we mark 10 years since the beginning of the protests for the defense of democracy and freedom on Independence Square, in the center of Kyiv.

1141809096,20231122,"This week, I am following up on last week’s article concerning the controversy surrounding the signing of the EU/OACPS Samoa Agreement.

On Wednesday, November 15, the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), as committed in July, signed the Samoa Agreement. Of the 79 members of the Organization of African, Caribbean, and Pacific States (OACPS), 41 member states signed in Samoa and three signed prior to the meeting. This is a total of 44. Among these 44, there were six countries from the Caribbean OACPS Forum (CARIFORUM) – Barbados, Belize, Dominican Republic, Haiti, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname.

For various reasons, 35 OACPS members did not sign, including eight from CARIFORUM – Jamaica among them.

The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Most Rev Charles Jason Gordon, seen in a video clip, passionately welcomed Trinidad and Tobago not signing this agreement which he interpreted as the EU imposing upon Trinidad and Tobago an ideology and a value system that is not theirs.

He stated that by signing this agreement, Trinidad and Tobago would be required to impose legislation allowing abortion, transgender, LGBTQ, comprehensive sex education, and a range of other values foreign to his country.

These and other comments made by Archbishop Gordon indicated to me that he was not familiar with the text of the agreement which he was addressing. His views were aligned with those of the Jamaica Coalition for a Healthy Society (JCHS). If you throw in a reference to colonialism and slavery, these are all issues which generate a lot of emotion in this region.

From my research, it is my understanding that the issues raised by Archbishop Gordon and JCHS were on the table during the negotiations with the EU, raised by OACPS members, including members from CARIFORUM. These issues were aired in both the CARIFORUM and OACPS at the technical and ministerial levels. CARIFORUM/OACPS negotiators placed proposals on the table to resolve these issues. Their proposals were accepted by the EU party.

An article on the website of the Gender in Geopolitics Institute, posted April 26, 2021, titled ‘The rights of LGBTI people or the sacrifices of the (post) Cotonou Agreement’, indicate that issues of gender identity and sexual orientation featured in the OACPS/EU negotiations. They did not go where the EU would originally have liked, as account was taken of difference of opinion with the OACPS and in the EU itself. It is stated that Robert Dussey, OACPS lead negotiator from Togo, respected these cultural differences, and for him, Africa and the OACPS were winners from these negotiations, because they did not capitulate. This article concludes that sexual orientation and gender identity are absent from the new EU/ACP partnership agreement.

Thereafter, CARIFORUM/OACPS, at their ministerial meetings, indicated that they were satisfied with the new agreement as amended and approved initialing the text which signalled conclusion of the negotiations. They were ready to proceed to signing.

Following the initialing by the lead negotiators in April 2021, Hungary from the EU side, in the European Council, refused to agree to signing this text. For the EU to sign the agreement, there had to be a unanimous decision in the council.

As the signing was further delayed in the EU up to July this year, the OACPS continued to signal, in its meetings and meetings with the EU, that it was satisfied with the text and ready to sign, urging the EU to resolve its problems.

Senator the Hon Dr Amery Browne, Minister of Foreign and CARICOM Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago, was president of the OACPS Council of Ministers in the second half of 2022. In November 2022, Minister Browne presided over the 115th Session of the OACPS Council and was co-president of the 45th Session of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers. During these meetings, it is reported that the OACPS Council reiterated the need to sign the new OACPS-EU Partnership Agreement. Minister Browne, in this capacity, also addressed the 42nd Joint OACPS/EU Parliamentary Assembly.

In a statement, Hon Mahen Kumar Seeruttun of Mauritius, President of the OACPS Council of Ministers, at the 43rd session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Brussels, Belgium, 27 June 2023, raised “the important issue of the continued delay in the signing of the Post-Cotonou Partnership Agreement … And today, more than two years after initialing, we have failed to sign the agreement because of no fault of the OACPS … I urge you to appeal to the European Council to do whatever is possible to put an end to this stalemate which has lasted for far too long.”

Note also that CARIFORUM/OACPS parliamentarians were involved in endorsing the signing of the Samoa Agreement.

So, after nearly two and a half years of consistently confirming their commitment to the Samoa Agreement, 35 OACPS members are yet to sign it. For CARIFORUM, which was among those that advocated for this agreement in its current structure, its position on the signing needs to be clarified in coming weeks.

How many of the eight countries will be signing? Trinidad and Tobago has said that it is completing internal processes. The surprise of the group is Jamaica, and it will be interesting to see what decision the Government takes.

In my opinion, the OACPS’s credibility as a negotiating partner is currently at stake.

1141812840,20231122,"Juba / Brussels — A delegation from the Forces for Freedom and Change-Central Council (FFC-CC) have arrived in the capital of South Sudan, Juba, at the invitation of President Salva Kiir, to discuss issues including a direct and public meeting with the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

In their public statement, the Forces of Freedom and Change explained that the delegation will hold meetings with several government officials in South Sudan on ways to end the war in Sudan, achieve peace, and establish a democratic civil transition.

""Conversation topics will include efforts to unify civil democratic forces, the recent discussions in Addis Ababa, and what emerged from our meetings in Cairo, along with plans for a direct and public meeting with the SAF and RSF,"" it said.

The Executive Office of the FFC-CC kickstarted four days of meetings in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, last Thursday.

During the African summit meetings, Salva Kiir met with the presidents of Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Kenya, in addition to SAF Commander-in-Chief and President of the Sovereignty Council Lt Gen Abdelfattah El Burhan, indicating that all parties welcome the involvement of South Sudan.

Several initiatives are actively working to resolve the Sudanese crisis, including the Jeddah Platform, mediated by Saudi Arabia, the United States, the African Union, the Civil Front to Stop the War, and the IGAD Quartet, headed by Kenyan President William Ruto.

The European Union affirmed its ""interest in what is happening in Sudan,"" and its keenness to end the war, address the humanitarian catastrophe, achieve stability, and resume the democratic transition.

On Sunday, representatives of the Communication and External Relations Committee of the Forces of Freedom and Change held a meeting with a delegation from the European Union, which included the Swedish envoy to Sudan, the ambassadors of Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, and the European Union representative in the Arab Republic of Egypt, in Cairo.

In their statement, the FFC-CC said that they presented their vision, which is based on the need to coordinate international and regional efforts in a unified negotiating platform, and the need for the political process to be comprehensive, and to address the reasons that led to the outbreak of war and develop final solutions to it.

They aim for democratic civil transformation and a single professional government, and for the national army to leave politics completely.

FFC-CC's representatives emphasized the coalition's involvement in efforts to build a broader anti-war civil democratic front based on the preparatory meeting that was held late last month in Addis Ababa.

Referring to the Civil Front to Stop the War, inaugurated in Addis Ababa last month, Siddig El Sadig El Mahdi, a leader in the FFC-CC, emphasised that ""real unity among democratic and civil forces is crucial for ending the war."" The meeting resulted in the formation of the Coordination of Democratic Civil Forces (Takaddum) in preparation for an inclusive founding conference.

Last week, the EU expressed its shock at the recent escalation of violence in Darfur. High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell said in a statement that ""the latest atrocities are seemingly part of a wider ethnic cleansing campaign conducted by the RSF to eradicate the non-Arab Masalit community from West Darfur, and comes on top of the first wave of violence in June."""

1141818485,20231122,"Strasbourg, France, Nov 22 (EFE).- The upcoming United Nations COP28 climate conference in Dubai’s Expo City should boost intensify global efforts against climate change because “the window of opportunity is closing,” warns European Union climate chief Wopke Hoekstra.

“We have to do more and faster,” Hoekstra said, highlighting the pressing need for accelerated action, citing warnings from scientists and climate action reports.

The EU Commissioner for Climate Action was speaking in an interview with journalists, including EFE, after the UN warned that current commitments under the Paris Agreement could result in a temperature rise of 2.5–2.9 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

This underscores the immediate need for heightened climate action since the Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, possibly even closer to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Hoekstra, who assumed the role of EU climate commissioner in October, will lead EU negotiations at the COP28 Summit starting on Nov. 30 in Dubai.

Over the past month and a half, he has engaged in diplomatic efforts across 13 countries, including Brazil, Chile, Spain, and Saudi Arabia, participating in 55 meetings with various stakeholders.

“There is no alternative but to continue on the ambitious path that Europe is on and do much more in the coming decade to ensure that we build bridges with the rest of the world,” he said.

Despite the EU being responsible for only 7 percent of global emissions, Hoekstra stressed the necessity of broad consensus among countries, companies, and citizens for successful climate action.

Hoekstra carries a negotiation mandate from the 27 EU countries, demanding a tripled renewable energy capacity by 2030, a doubled energy efficiency rate, and limited hydrocarbon subsidies.

The EU’s objective is to persuade the global community, including oil-producing nations, to shift away from fossil fuels, particularly coal.

Financing remains a key issue, with negotiations ongoing for a loss and damage fund to cover the impact of climate change on vulnerable states.

Regarding China’s role, Hoekstra advocated for contributions, emphasizing that the loss and damage fund should benefit those most in need, particularly in Africa.

“What I told our partners in China last week (…) is that everyone who can pay should do so,” said Hoekstra, who met China’s Special Envoy on Climate Change last week to prepare for the climate change conference in Dubai.

The European Union has committed to a “substantial contribution” to the fund, with the exact amount and composition yet to be disclosed.

The COP28 climate negotiations coincide with geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Israel’s military offensive in Gaza.

“If you look at what has happened in the last six or seven years, things have become infinitely more difficult,” Hoekstra said. “Results need to be achieved, and there is no time to lose.” EFE"
1141826971,20231122,"The European Union has said it had spent a total of 88 million euros to support Nigeria’s anti-corruption efforts since 2005, even as it announced another 30 million euros to improve the rule of law, tackle corruption, and reduce gender-based violence in the country for the next five years.

The EU Ambassador and Head of Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Samuela Isopi, stated this on Tuesday in Abuja at the formal launch of the Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption (ROLAC Phase II) Programme, implemented by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) and funded by the European Union.

She also disclosed that through partnership with the project, 35 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have so far domesticated the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Act 2015 to curb incessant cases of violence across states.

Ambassador Isopi said the programme is aimed at supporting the strengthening of the rule of law and the fight against corruption as well as reducing gender-based violence while promoting respect for human rights and ensuring inclusivity for all Nigerians.

While explaining that 1.5 million Nigerians were affected in the first phase of the programme, the diplomat said the second phase which would run for five years would be implemented in five states; Adamawa, Anambra, Edo, Kano, and Lagos, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), with the possibility of extension to two more states.

The envoy said, “The programme would be implemented by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) and funded by the European Union”.

1141826974,20231122,"Day 637 of the invasion of Ukraine. Summary of key events in the last 24 hours:
• Putin allowed ""negotiations"" about the ""tragedy"" in Ukraine and compared Russia to Israel
• Putin's administration quells a protest by relatives of those mobilized with money
• Ukraine claims to have killed 320,000 Russians since the war began
• The EU will produce 1.4 million shells for Ukraine by spring
• Video shows how Russia helps migrants cross the border with Finland
• After supplying Russia with missiles, Pyongyang was able to launch a missile with a military satellite



Putin allowed ""negotiations"" about the ""tragedy"" in Ukraine and compared Russia to Israel

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his country is ""ready for negotiations"" and must think about how to end the ""tragedy"" in Ukraine.

In his first statement to the G20 group of nations since Russia invaded Ukraine, he also attacked Kyiv with accusations of the failure of dialogue so far and tried to compare the invasion to the conflict between Israel and the Islamist movement Hamas.

This G20 summit, two months after the leaders' in-person meeting in New Delhi, India (which Putin did not attend due to his ""busy schedule""), was video-conferenced. US President Joe Biden decided not to participate in it, and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, according to Bloomberg, was represented by Premier Li Qiang.

Putin hit back at other leaders who said they were shaken by the war, which has become (if military casualties are taken into account) Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II and the most serious confrontation between Russia and the West in decades.

""Yes, of course, military action is always a tragedy,"" Putin said. ""And, of course, we have to think about how to stop this tragedy,"" Putin said. ""By the way, Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine.""

Last October, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree calling talks on Ukraine ""impossible"" under the current leadership in the Kremlin, although he left the door open to negotiations with Russia. Meanwhile, a Russian official told Reuters that Moscow cannot work with the current government in Kyiv either, and the ""special military operation"" (i.e., the war) must continue in order to ""demilitarize"" Ukraine.

This comes days after Zelensky began issuing warnings about a Russian plan to oust him from power. He said yesterday that Moscow's plan is to carry out this intention by the end of the year.

After calling the hostilities a ""tragedy"", he moved on to the war between Israel and Hamas, saying: ""And the extermination of the civilian population in Palestine, in the Gaza Strip, didn't this shake people today? And the fact that doctors have to operate children, to operate with a scalpel on children's bodies without anesthesia - doesn't that shake people?""

Since the beginning of the war, Russia has been in contact with Hamas and has strongly advocated an end to the war and the fighting in Gaza.

Israel, however, turned out to be only one point in his comparison of tragedies, which he mentioned before the 2014 revolution in Ukraine that toppled President Viktor Yanukovych: ""And the bloody coup in Ukraine in 2014, followed by the Kyiv regime's war against its own people in Donbas - didn't that shake you?""

Russia insists that the events that began in Ukraine in 2013 due to Ukraine's departure from the EU, chosen by Yanukovych, were a Western-directed scenario that led to the ""coup"". Moscow also insists that Kyiv is committing encroachments against ""Russian-speaking"" people in eastern Ukraine, which prompted its de facto intervention in the Donbas in 2014, which escalated into a full-scale invasion in 2022.

Putin's administration quells a protest by relatives of those mobilized with money



The administration of the Russian president has advised the regional authorities to ""suppress with money"" the protests of the relatives of mobilized servicemen who insist on their return from the front, Verstka reports, citing its sources.

The Kremlin is sure that ""the wives are waiting for the bank cards with the salary from the war, not their husbands"".

""If it is not possible to solve all the problems, to pay everyone the maximum amount of money. <...> At the same time, it is necessary to separate the dissatisfied as much as possible on private issues - some need a husband, others money, others just to be listened to,"" one of the sources described the Kremlin's recommendations.

AP believes that the dissatisfaction of the relatives of those mobilized is one of the main problems of the presidential election campaign.

In recent weeks, relatives of those mobilized have tried to hold rallies in several Russian regions. In most cases the authorities refused them; in Novosibirsk, they allowed a ""closed rally"". In Moscow, the authorities refused to hold a rally on October 25, citing the epidemiological situation. The day before, the organizers challenged this decision in court. Relatives of those mobilized submitted a request to hold a concert on December 16 at ""Teatralna Square"" dedicated to Mother's Day.

Ukraine claims to have killed 320,000 Russians since the war began

Over the past 24 hours, 850 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine, and since the beginning of the full-scale war, the total combat losses of the enemy have amounted to 320,670 people, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Army.

A huge amount of destroyed equipment is also reported, in particular artillery systems - 7769 (+17 in the past day), tanks - 5446 (+7), armored fighting vehicles - 10188 (+14), operational-tactical UAV - 5784 (+ 13), air defense equipment - 589 (+1), automotive equipment and tankers - 10159 (+25), special equipment - 1105 (+7).

In addition, since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 899 enemy MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket System), 323 aircraft, 324 helicopters, 1,564 cruise missiles, 22 ships/boats and one submarine have been destroyed, writes the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN.

The General Staff also reported drone and cruise missile attacks that night.

The Air Force reported that Russian forces attacked from the southeast direction (Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Russia) with 14 Shahed drones and an X-22 cruise missile from a Tu22M3 aircraft from the same direction. All 14 Shahed-131/136 drones were destroyed.

The Kh-22 cruise missile missed its target and fell in the Zaporizhzhia region in the open, and private houses were damaged by the blast wave. According to preliminary data, no one was injured.

Ukraine was attacked with 14 drones and several missiles last night, Kyiv reported. Air defense systems have disabled all drones.

In the waters of the Black Sea, in the direction of Crimea, 4 sea drones were destroyed, the Russian Ministry of Defense wrote on its Telegram channel.

The European Union will keep its promise to provide one million shells to Ukraine and even more. This was said by the European Commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, in Strasbourg.

According to him, this unit will be produced in the spring. A week ago, the European Union's high representative for foreign policy, Josep Borrell, admitted that the Union may not be able to deliver the promised shells by the end of the year.

The EU will produce 1.4 million shells for Ukraine by spring

The EU will produce 1.3 or 1.4 million 152 and 155 caliber shells for Ukraine by spring, surpassing the promised 1 million.

This was stated by the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He answered questions from MEPs about how the EU would fulfill its promise to deliver 1 million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine by March 2024.

""We made the commitment in the spring when there was such an opportunity. I have told this Parliament that it will be implemented,"" Breton pointed out.

Breton also recalled another commitment made by EU member states. It is to supply munitions from their stockpiles through joint purchasing and other means as the industrial base grows and as opportunity arises.

The reason the EU currently does not have the power to produce enough ammunition is the fact that capacity has declined in peacetime.

Thierry Breton admitted that 40 percent of EU arms production currently goes outside Europe.

""We must ask all member states' defense ministers to clearly and firmly state and tell their defense businesses to prioritize exports to Ukraine in the coming months. I make this request here, in front of you, in front of the European Parliament, to all ministers,"" said the European Commissioner.

He tried to calm the MEPs by saying that the commitment was for spring, and now winter has not yet come. Breton recalled that he had visited a number of countries where weapons were produced.

“If the funds are there, the capacity will be there. If the production enterprises in France, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria show discipline and put pressure on the producers, we will keep the commitment,"" assured Breton.

Video shows how Russia helps migrants cross the border with Finland

Finland has accused Russia of handing out bicycles and scooters to migrants to help them cross the border as part of a plan to destabilize Europe.

Antti Hakkanen, Finland's defense minister, accused the Kremlin of using its hybrid warfare ""playbook"" by encouraging migrants to enter the country without documents.

Helsinki ordered the closure of four of its eight road crossing points with Russia, and the European Commission promised to send a border control unit to Finland.

After supplying Russia with missiles, Pyongyang was able to launch a missile with a military satellite

South Korea has announced it is unilaterally suspending part of a 2018 inter-Korean agreement to reduce military tensions in response to the launch of a military satellite by its northern neighbor.

North Korea said it had placed its first spy satellite into orbit on Tuesday and promised to launch it in the near future. Pictures released by North Korean state media showed leader Kim Jong-un watching the missile launch.

South Korea and Japan, which first reported the launch, said they were still verifying that the satellite was in orbit, and the Pentagon said the US military was still assessing whether the launch was successful.

Seoul will resume intelligence and border surveillance under a proposal approved at an emergency cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Han Dak-su.

""North Korea has clearly demonstrated its unwillingness to abide by the Sept. 19 military agreement aimed at reducing military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and building confidence,"" Yonhap news agency quoted Han Duck-sooas saying.

It is noted that Seoul will immediately resume intelligence operations in the area of the Military Demarcation Line separating the two Koreas, also known as the Demilitarized Zone.

""The ability of our armed forces to identify threat targets and their readiness to respond will be greatly improved,"" the prime minister said.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is on a state visit to the UK, approved the denunciation remotely.

The launch is the first since Kim Jong-un met Russian President Vladimir Putin at Russia's state-of-the-art space facility in September, where the Russian president pledged to help Pyongyang build satellites.

South Korean officials said the latest launch likely involved technical assistance from Moscow as part of a growing partnership in which North Korea sends millions of artillery shells to Russia.

Earlier, Pyongyang announced its first successful launch of the Chollima-1 launch vehicle, which put the Mulligen-1 satellite into orbit, as well as plans to launch several more such satellites ""soon.""

Previously, Pyongyang made two unsuccessful attempts to put a reconnaissance satellite into orbit - in May and August this year.

1141832511,20231122,"Work on the construction of military operating bases along Ghana’s northern frontiers has reached an advanced stage of completion, says President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.

The facilities, comprising twelve military forward operating and three logistic bases, aim to strengthen the Army’s capabilities to contain the threats emanating from across the country’s frontiers.

Ghana remains one of the most peaceful countries in sub-Saharan Africa despite the growing instability in the Region – borne out of violent extremism, terrorist attacks and military coups.

President Akufo-Addo, addressing army officials at a graduation parade of the Ghana Military Academy, in Accra, assured that the country was taking no chances in respect of securing its territorial integrity.

The military operating bases, he said, would be adequately resourced with personnel and the requisite logistics to swiftly deal with any threats that had the potential to disrupt the peace and stability of the country.

The Sahel Region is the epicentre of terrorism worldwide, says the Institute for Economics and Peace.

From January 1 to June 30, 2023, it is estimated that the Region recorded 1, 814 incidents of terrorist attacks, which resulted in 4, 593 fatalities.

The political instability has been exacerbated by the spiraling military coups, with the elected Presidents of Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger, forcibly removed from office in the last three years.

Given the prevailing security threats, the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) continues to receive support, in terms of military assistance, from international bodies, including the UN and European Union (EU).

“The eminent threats in the northern part of Ghana have necessitated the establishment of forward operating and logistics bases along our entire northern border,” the President said.

In pursuance of its determination to build the capacity of the personnel, the Armed Forces had also initiated the process for the grant of a presidential charter for the establishment of a National University of Defence Studies, he noted.

“I have directed that the University be established next year,” President Nana Akufo-Addo, also the Commander-in-Chief, affirmed.

He said it would serve as a multi-disciplinary higher education institution that would educate personnel of the GAF, other security agencies, governmental departments and agencies and foreign military personnel. It will conduct scientific research in military science, defence and strategic studies, international relations and related subjects.

It is intended to serve as a model research and educational centre for the conduct of long-term research, capacity building and policy shaping in the fields of defence and security as well as current analysis and strategic studies for various state institutions.

A Senior UN official recently told the Security Council that the situation in West Africa and the Sahel had deteriorated against a backdrop of shrinking civic and political space.

The Special Representative and Head of the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Leonardo Santos Simao, said the “crisis in the Sahel requires tangible and long-term support to stamp out the scourge of terrorism and address the Region’s burgeoning humanitarian crisis”."

London: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol gets down to business Wednesday on the second day of his state visit to Britain, meeting political leaders and signing a new diplomatic accord.

He will later hold talks with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as well as speak to opposition leader Keir Starmer, who is tipped to become Britain's next leader at an election expected in 2024.

Earlier, Yoon addressed a business forum attended by CEOs and other representatives from both countries, which will kickstart talks on a beefed-up UK-South Korea free trade deal.

While meeting Sunak, he will formally agree a new pact -- the ""Downing Street Accord"" -- set to deepen cooperation on technology, defence and security, and ""redefine the relationship"", according to the UK government.

Yoon has said the visit is ""a springboard"" for greater cooperation, with South Korea aiming to expand business opportunities and high-tech industry supply chains as well as bolster diplomatic and defence ties.

Addressing British lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday -- the first day of his three-day visit -- he said their bilateral relations ""will be reborn as true global strategic partners"".

Wednesday's meetings follow the formal royal welcome Yoon and his wife, First Lady Kim Keon Hee, received on their first day, which saw London roll out the red carpet.

King Charles III threw a lavish state banquet at Buckingham Palace -- attended by an array of VIPs, including other UK royals and K-pop stars Blackpink -- to end a packed day of pomp-filled ceremony.

Earlier, the first couple of South Korea enjoyed a private lunch at the palace and visited Westminster Abbey, where Charles was formally crowned monarch six months ago.

Yoon is the first foreign leader hosted by Charles since his May coronation, with the visit coming as Britain forges stronger post-Brexit ties with fast-growing economies in the Indo-Pacific region.

The new accord to be signed Wednesday follows the signing of similar partnerships with Singapore and Japan earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Britain and South Korea are set to broaden cooperation on AI, cybersecurity, nuclear energy and defence, along as working to tackle North Korea's threat, according to Yoon.

The bid to upgrade their free trade arrangements follow the launch last year of a consultation on an enhanced deal.

The existing accord replicates the European Union's agreement with South Korea, and London is eager to showcase the benefits of having left the bloc by striking FTAs with Indo-Pacific nations.

UK Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch launched the talks with her South Korean counterpart at the business forum taking place alongside the state visit.

The two countries are set to announce £21 billion ($26 billion) of investments in green energy and infrastructure projects across the UK at the forum, according to her ministry.

Badenoch said an enhanced deal would boost Britain's vital services sector, while also creating ""new opportunities"" for UK exports in the food and luxury goods sectors.

Total trade in goods and services between the UK and South Korea was £16.1 billion in the year to the end of June.

Defence cooperation will also be part of the new accord, with both countries pledging to step up joint training and operations ""to create the most comprehensive exercise regime between the UK and any partner other than the US"".

The pact comes as North Korea launched what it claims is a spy satellite, Seoul said Tuesday, in Pyongyang's third attempt this year to get a military eye in the sky."

The draft paper, which was seen by Bloomberg, will be discussed by EU ambassadors this week and by the bloc’s leaders next month. It will also form the basis of consultations with Kyiv and the Group of Seven (G7) nations.

The G7 members agreed at the 2023 NATO summit to coordinate a set of bilateral security guarantees with Ukraine aimed at deterring “Russian aggression” against the country.

In turn, Ukraine has committed to continuing a series of reforms, including in the law enforcement and judicial systems, as well as in the security and defense sectors.

The EU's framework program includes the following proposals:

 “A predictable, efficient, sustainable and long-term mechanism for the provision of military equipment to Ukraine” that mobilizes the European defense industry

 Greater cooperation with the Ukrainian defense industry to boost capacity and align standards

 Strengthening Ukraine’s ability to counter cyber and hybrid threats as well as disinformation

 Helping Ukraine with its reform agenda relating to its EU accession process, as well as boosting its ability to monitor stocks of firearms, light weapons and ammunition and counter any illegal trafficking

The document states that support for arms supplies, as before, will be provided through the European Peace Fund, a mechanism that reimburses member states for what they supply to Ukraine.

According to an EU diplomat in conversation with journalists, the initial EU plan to allocate 20 billion euros ($21.8 billion) over four years for compensating the transfer of weapons to Ukraine is at risk of falling apart because some member states, including Germany, could not agree on terms.

Instead, EU countries hope to reach an agreement to allocate 5 billion euros in 2024 with commitments for ongoing support.

EU leaders are also expected to discuss the European Commission's recommendation to officially begin membership negotiations with Ukraine at the December summit.

Some streams of support for Ukraine from the EU are blocked by Hungary, as Budapest wants Brussels to first discuss its joint strategy toward Kyiv, said another diplomat."

“Lebanon’s Independence Day is taking place this year within a difficult regional context. The European Union urges all actors to show utmost restraint to avoid any further escalation,” the statement said.

“In this period of uncertainty, we encourage Lebanese decision-makers to set aside their differences and take long overdue decisions. This includes electing a President, forming a fully-functioning Government, and implementing necessary macroeconomic and financial reforms,” it added.

Members of the new centrist majority said it was symbolic to begin their term with work on ending one of the bans introduced by the outgoing right-wing government.

“The reinstatement of IVF funding is the first decision of the democratic majority,” said one of its lawmakers, Agnieszka Pomaska.

The date of the final vote on the program, estimated at some 500 million zlotys ($125 million) a year, was not immediately known.

The lawmakers stressed that thousands of childless couples in the shrinking nation of some 38 million people were waiting for the return of government support for IVF. State funding was introduced in 2013 by a liberal government led by Donald Tusk, but the conservative government banned it in 2016 in one of its first moves, saying the procedure involved destroying human embryos.

Some 22,000 children were born during the program’s existence, according to Health Ministry figures. More than 100,000 children have been born since the IVF procedure was first performed in Poland in 1987.

A citizens’ proposal seeking to reinstate government funding was put on hold by the ruling Law and Justice party earlier this year. Many Law and Justice lawmakers left the chamber during Wednesday’s discussion to demonstrate displeasure.

However, an aide to President Andrzej Duda, who is an ally of Law and Justice, said Duda likely won’t use his veto power against the reinstatement of state funding for IVF.

A coalition of pro-European Union parties won a majority of seats in last month’s general election and has embarked on reversing some of the laws they see as restrictive. A new coalition government led by Tusk is expected to be in place in mid-December, but Duda gave Law and Justice the first shot at forming the Cabinet."

1141858963,20231121,"There is no room for negotiations by non-signatories, including Jamaica, for any terms under the new European Union/Africa Caribbean Pacific (EU/ACP) Partnership Agreement, and no benefits to be derived until countries sign, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Minister Kamina Johnson Smith said yesterday.

The administration two weeks ago said it would delay signing what is now the Samoa Agreement, which replaces the Cotonou Agreement that expired in 2020, to facilitate ongoing consultations.

Yesterday, during a press conference outlining plans for Sunday’s public session of the Jamaica Labour Party's (JLP) 80th annual conference, Johnson Smith said there would be no benefit for Jamaica before that signing takes place.

“We are under the transitional arrangement now, of Cotonou, and then the Samoa agreement will require us to sign in order to benefit from the new arrangement,” Johnson Smith told The Gleaner after the press conference.

She said the Government was aware of concerns about whether the country’s sovereignty was in danger. The new treaty has provided the legal framework guiding relations between the EU's 27 nations and 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.

“We are quite clear that our sovereignty will be preserved and is always at the forefront of our minds when we are having discussions and negotiations for treaties. When the Cotonou partnership arrangement was going to expire in 2020, the great push for the whole of the European Union and the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS) which, remember, is 79 countries, Jamaica, and myself, was actually president of the Council of Ministers who received the mandate of the 79 countries for us to start the negotiations towards a post Cotonou arrangement because this is the development and funding mechanism for all 79 countries,” Johnson Smith told The Gleaner. “So, it is important and preserving the sovereignty of our individual nations was very important and has always been so we know that while when you are negotiating 79 countries with 27 countries that there are going to be differences of opinion as to what is a perfect agreement. But preserving our sovereignty, always clear.”

She also told The Gleaner that “there is nothing in the agreement that would supersede any law, any Jamaican law or any other country's law in that document as it stands"".

She further explained: “There are no adjustments to be made. But what we do wish to do is to issue an interpreted declaration which will make clear the terms, where it is that there are concerns, [and] that [where] Jamaicans feel there are concerns, our understanding can be made clear to stand the test of time.

“The issue being that while we are confident that the agreement will not supersede any Jamaica law that we want it to be made clear - remember this is a 20-year agreement - that at the point of signing that the interpretation that we expect is crystal,” she stated.

The European Union provides financial support to the Government in the form of grant funding and is the largest contributor to government coffers. It has contributed billions to Jamaica in the last 40 years and is funding a number of government programmes, while also contributing to civil society organisations and programmes run by them.

During a recent post Cabinet press conference, Johnson Smith told journalists that, “throughout the negotiations which concluded in 2021, the Government took on board the views of various stakeholders including members of civil society. But the Jamaica Coalition of Healthy Society said that, for 27 months, itself and seven other Jamaican NGOs have been impressing upon the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade to take heed of the “obvious threats to Jamaica’s national sovereignty in the current language of the agreement"".

A release from the body and supported by several citizens groups including religious organisations cited what is termed the “glaring danger” of multiple clauses, that would bind Jamaica to undefined human rights obligations and tied to trade sanctions.

The concerned groups cited (Article 101(7) General Pact) and noted that the new agreement would reintroduce Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) back into schools despite parents’ outrage in 2012 with regards to CSE’s sexualising content (Article 48(7) Caribbean Pact); trap the nation in yet-to-be-negotiated international instruments (Article 36(2) General Pact), and demand the acceptance of terms that directly threaten citizens’ freedom of conscience and speech (Article 9(2) and Article 20(1), General Pact) among other concerns. At least six bodies and individuals have urged the Government to sign the new agreement."
1141863169,20231122,"The European Union’s troubled fiscal pact, once branded as “stupid” by former European Commission President Romano Prodi, has reached its sell-by date. Countries have blithely ignored it for years. And now the 27-nation bloc wants to overhaul it. The proposed revamp is a step forward. But with the climate challenge set to strain public finances, the discussion needs to rapidly shift to more joint EU funds.

A reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, established in 1997, is long overdue. Born out of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty that paved the way for the euro, the framework aims to cap national deficits at 3% of a country’s GDP and governments’ debt at 60% of GDP. Yet the fiscal rules have been repeatedly trampled upon, including from supposedly thrifty countries such as Germany, without much consequences – an indictment of the feeble enforcement mechanism. Average EU debt has been consistently above the 60% target. At present, it’s at 83% of GDP, and above 100% in six of the 19 euro zone members.

The framework became useless once the Covid-19 pandemic forced nations to spend big to support their faltering economies and is frozen until the end of 2023.

NEW COURSE

 The proposed revamp of the fiscal pact, now under discussion, is an improvement. It would keep the original deficit and debt goals intact, to avoid a laborious treaty change. But it focuses the budget analysis on net expenditure. That’s defined as public spending minus debt interest payments and measures deemed as extraordinary, such as higher unemployment benefits in a recession. Relying on a single indicator promises more transparency and consistency. Yet removing debt interest costs from the calculations might give an unfair advantage to voracious borrowers such as Italy and Greece while at the same time hiding the real size of their fiscal troubles.

The other main feature of the proposed new pact is that states that breach its targets will have at least four years, and up to seven years, to improve their fiscal stance. The rationale is that growth-boosting reforms may require upfront investments that bloat the size of a country’s debt in the short term. The European Commission, the EU’s executive, would agree on targets during bilateral discussions that consider the specific economic characteristics and business cycles of each nation. That’s a welcome departure from the current one-size-fits-all approach. To ensure enforcement, nations failing to deliver on reforms and investment commitments will have their fiscal adjustment period shortened. The Commission would also name and shame non-compliant countries in public scorecards. That may be more effective than threatening fines that never materialised.

Not everyone is happy. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner wants to have clear reduction targets for debts and deficits. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni would like to exclude expenses like defence. And several member states are nervous about giving the Commission too much clout over budgets, EU officials told Breakingviews. Yet French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Nov. 9 he was optimistic about reaching a deal with Germany within weeks, ahead of a pan-EU agreement by year end.

BRAVE NEW DEBT WORLD

 For all of Brussels’ reforming zeal, Europe’s future debt rules ignore a giant elephant in the room: climate change. Tackling that challenge may require the EU to invest 620 billion euros more per year by 2030, or nearly 4% of the bloc’s annual GDP last year. Pan-EU post-pandemic cash and other joint public funds amounting to around 1% of GDP will help pay for some green investments. But these resources are due to run out after 2026. Meanwhile, the United States is looking to shower its key green industries with tax credits and subsidies for a decade.

One way to address the impending debt dilemma is for the EU to extend a suspension of its state aid regime to allow individual nations to offer incentives for green and strategic industries. But countries with little fiscal room, like Greece, Italy or Spain will struggle to do that effectively. Germany, with debt at just 66% of GDP, has promised nearly 14 billion euros in subsidies to chipmakers Intel INTC.O and TSMC 2330.TW. Yet a constitutional court ruling on Nov. 15 may scupper Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s plan for a 60-billion-euro green transition fund.

Another option is to remove green investments from the fiscal rules’ deficit calculations. But differentiating investments from current expenditures may be tricky. And bond investors would in any case spot which national debts are rising too fast. Using proceeds from carbon emission permits and tariffs imposed on carbon-intensive products imported into the EU to pay for green projects is also a good idea. But these may yield just 13 billion euros per year after 2026.

Issuing common EU funds in debt markets, like the 800 billion euros the bloc approved to handle the consequences of Covid-19, seems the most sensible approach to face the mounting joint green challenge. The cash, which won’t directly impact national public finances, could be used to fund projects deemed strategic for the entire bloc, like greater solar and wind power capacity, a comprehensive e-charging network and better ways to recycle critical materials. Germany, the region’s largest economy, and other wealthy countries oppose any form of common EU borrowing for fear they will have to pick up the tab if other nations are less fiscally disciplined.

To solve the conundrum, other EU nations may need to consider a grand fiscal bargain: accepting some numerical deficit and debt reduction targets in exchange for the promise to issue more EU debt after 2026. This would stop short of the fully-fledged fiscal union championed, among others, by former European Central Bank president and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. But it might overcome many countries’ objections to handing control of taxation to a supranational body while boosting the EU’s efforts to fight the global climate threat.

A revised set of fiscal rules is the minimum the EU could do. To address the twin challenge of rising debts and increasing need for green funds, Europe will require a framework that is at the same time more potent and more flexible.

1141863170,20231122,"Ten years ago today, young Ukrainians began protests in favor of a European orientation for their country. By a mixture of threats and bribes, Putin had dissuaded Ukraine’s president from signing an agreement with the European Union. After Ukrainian students were beaten by security forces, the protests took on a mass character, now in support of the rule of law. Russian television characterized Ukrainians protestors as fascists and gays, and in late December 2013 Putin began gathering forces for an invasion of Ukraine. In February 2014, right after a massacre of protestors, Russia invaded Ukraine, occupying Crimea and some territory in the eastern region known as Donbas.

This guest text from Marci Shore, focuses on the experiences of the protestors themselves, people who took risks for a better kind of politics, and prevailed. Ukraine did not collapse when invaded in 2014, nor during the full-scale invasion of 2022. Putin (and many others) were mistaken about Ukrainians’ capacity to believe in themselves and in ideals, and to organize themselves to resist. Important as it is to analyze the war as such, there is also the impalpable element of choice, a choice of one kind of life over another. That is the subject here, and it is relevant everywhere. Marci’s book on the Maidan, now updated to bring the account through the war, is Ukrainian Night. This text appeared in German in the taz.

The present is ungraspable in its dimensionlessness. It has no duration. For Jean-Paul Sartre, the present had to be understood as a border, the border between the realm of facticity—what has already happened and simply is —and the realm of transcendence, an opening to go beyond what has been. Revolution illuminates this border; it is a moment of choice.

In 2004 the team of Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych, a Kremlin-allied oligarch, committed election fraud—and poisoned Yanukovych’s opponent, Viktor Yushchenko, with dioxin. Mass protests on the Maidan, Kyiv’s central square, forced a second election; this time Yushchenko won decisively. In Kyiv the mood was elated. It seemed Yanukovych could never come back. Yet Yushchenko proved a deep disappointment. And Yanukovych tapped into the American boutique industry of PR for gangster-types with presidential ambitions. Tutored by his Washington consultant, Yanukovych reemerged in 2010 to win the presidential elections, this time legitimately.

Afterwards Yanukovych gave his Washington consultant—whose name was Paul Manafort—a thank-you gift: a jar of black caviar worth over $30,000.

The consolation prize Yanukovych dangled before a liberal intelligentsia that hated him was the distant prospect of European integration. For a young generation in particular, “Europe” was the object of the greatest desire. In November 2013 Ukraine was expected to sign a long-anticipated association agreement with the European Union. At the eleventh hour, on 21 November 2013, Yanukovych refused.

The disappointment was especially crushing for students, who felt as if their future had vanished; Europe would be closed to them. That evening a thirty-two-year-old Ukrainian journalist from Kabul named Mustafa Nayyem wrote in Russian on his Facebook page: “Come on, let’s get serious. Who is ready to go out to the Maidan by midnight tonight? ‘Likes’ don’t count.”

That night Ukrainians—overwhelming students—came to the Maidan—and stayed. They held hands and shouted, “Ukraine is Europe!” At 4 am on 30 November 2013 Yanukovych sent his riot police to the Maidan to beat the students. The violence against peaceful protestors was a shock. Yanukovych, it seems, was counting on the shock to shake parents into pulling their kids off the streets. That was when something remarkable happened: instead of pulling their kids off the streets, the parents joined them there. It was a historic Aufhebung of Oedipal rebellion. Now there were close to a million people on the streets of Kyiv, and they were shouting, “We will not permit you to beat our children!”

One of those beaten children was sixteen-year-old son Roman Ratushnyy.

“Your mother must have been very upset,” I said to him. “But she let you go back?”

The Maidan became not only a site of protest, but also a parallel polis. Kitchens were operating. Musicians performed, artists painted, physicians treated the injured. There was a library, an Open University, a communal upright piano. People erected tents, built bonfires, and cooked soup in iron cauldrons. Volunteers cleared snow and ice. An LGBT organization transformed its confidential hotline into an emergency hotline for the Maidan.

Borders that normally existed between people dissolved; it became very easy to talk to strangers. “There were very different people,” a student named Misha told me, “Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, Poles, Tatars, Armenians with Azerbajzhanis, Georgians, Ukrainian-speakers, Russian-speakers.” There was a feeling that not only ethnic divisions, but also socio-economic divisions had been overcome. The Maidan was a “laboratory of the social contract,” in one writer’s description, “a union of IT specialists from Dnipropetrovsk and a Hutsul shepherd, an Odessa mathematician and a Kyiv businessman, a translator from Lviv and a Tatar peasant from Crimea.”

The historian Yaroslav Hrytsak described the Maidan as akin to Noah's Ark: it took “two of every kind.” There were people of all political sympathies from radical left to radical right. For the filmmaker Oleksiy Radynski, Europe's discomfort at watching Ukraine resembled Caliban's grimace upon seeing the reflection of his own face in the mirror.

On January 16 Yanukovych’s government passed “dictatorship laws,” revoking the rights of free speech and assembly. Everyone on the Maidan was declared a criminal. Yanukovych’s riot police used tear gas, rubber bullets, stun grenades, and water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures. Protestors were disappearing. An activist’s body was found maimed and frozen in the woods. Those who returned were often disfigured, missing, for instance, part of an ear.

Hannah Arendt described the “character of startling unexpectedness… inherent in all beginnings.” When Ukrainians went to the Maidan on 21 November, no one expected to die there. But by the end of January, after the first protestors had been shot to death by the police, an existential transformation was palpable. The quality of temporality itself changed; people lost track of time, of night and day. In Kyiv no one slept anymore. The Maidan lived in what Walter Benjamin called the Jetztzeit, the-time-is-now-time. A critical mass of people had made a decision: they were willing to die there if need be.

This was the moment—art curator Vasyl Cherepanyn believed—when Ukrainian society as it exists today was born.

In February 2014 the Maidan culminated in a sniper massacre that left a hundred protestors dead. Yanukovych fled to Russia. The Kremlin illegally annexed Crimea, and sent “Russian tourists” across the border to instigate a war in eastern Ukraine, where a motley crew of Kremlin-backed separatists claimed to be protecting Russian-speakers from the Ukrainian Nazis brought to power by the American-orchestrated fascist coup in the capital. That war has not ended.

During the winter of 2013-2014 Russian journalists continually asked those on the Maidan who had organized them, what help they got from the Americans. “They simply could not grasp,” one young woman described, “that we ourselves organized ourselves.” Kremlin propaganda, the conviction that American intelligence or some other world-controlling force must be pulling the strings, betrayed not only malicious intent, but also an inability to believe that there could be such a thing as individuals thinking and acting for themselves.

Eight years later, in spring 2022, Russian soldiers who occupied Kherson could not believe that the local people who came out to protest were not controlled by “some mastermind out there.” “They weren’t able to consider the possibility,” a woman from Kherson told journalists, “that people who care about freedom, democracy and self-determination are self-organizing.”

Roman Ratushnyy belonged to the generation who had come of age on the Maidan, with its legacy of people who saw themselves as subjects, not objects of history. He became an environmental and anti-corruption activist. When Russia launched a full-scale invasion, he joined the military.

In June 2022 Roman was killed on the frontlines.

Today Ukrainians do not speak about “after the war;” they speak about “after the victory”—пiсля перемоги (pislya peremohy). “Peremoha”— Polish theater director Krzysztof Czyżewski suggested—should become part of a new universal vocabulary. The prefix pere indicates a crossing and moha means “I can.” Peremoha—“victory”—literally expresses a going beyond what one is able to do.

When Ukrainian writer Kateryna Mishchenko’s colleagues talked about the war, they talked about Russian imperialism, about Stalinism and colonization. “For me”—Kateryna wrote—“his war has a fairly clear point of reference – the Maidan. Perhaps it is worth returning to this place to find the future.”

For Sartre, to live in mauvaise foi was to project facticity into the future and so deny the possibility—and responsibility—of going beyond what is. The lesson of the Maidan is that we can go beyond who we have been until now. We can—even if that light illuminating the border that is the present shines only in rare moments, flickers, and then appears to be gone.

The views expressed are the author’s and not necessarily of Kyiv Post."
1141866225,20231122,"Even though Israel has approved a temporary ceasefire in its unprecedented assault on Gaza following Hamas’s October 7 attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made clear that he still believes it is a “time for war,” not for peace.

On Tuesday, he vowed that the war will continue “until Hamas is destroyed, all the hostages are released and there is nobody in Gaza who can threaten Israel.”

But while US leaders have supported the Israeli war effort, they have also held out hope for an eventual two-state solution in which Israel and a sovereign Palestine exist side by side: “The only ultimate answer here is a two-state solution that’s real,” US President Joe Biden said recently.

The two-state solution isn’t the only approach to solving the Israel-Palestine conflict. But it is the mainstream one; it’s been the international community’s approach for the last several decades. The idea is that US-brokered negotiations can lead to a peace treaty, or a “final status agreement,” which would establish a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank in exchange for a permanent end to hostilities.

But in the three decades since this peace process really began — with the historic Oslo Accords in 1993 — the two-state solution has slipped further away. A lack of political will in Israel, Palestine, and the US, as well as disagreement over the precise contours of the deal, have rendered negotiations unsuccessful. Major sticking points include: what the borders of the two states should be (and where Jerusalem falls in that), whether Palestinian refugees who were forced out of what is now Israel will be able to once again live there (also known as the “right of return”), and how to establish security guarantees for both Israelis and Palestinians. Today, all of these issues remain major impediments to peace.

[Related: Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine]

Violence perpetrated by Palestinian militants such as Hamas — an organization many countries designate as a terrorist group — as well as by Israeli security forces, has eroded trust on both sides. So, too, has Israel’s expansion of illegal settlements in West Bank territory that the international community sought to set aside for Palestine. The more extreme elements of Israeli and Palestinian society, and their political leaders, have forestalled negotiations at critical moments.

Israel and its allies have often laid the blame at the feet of Palestinians for rejecting what they saw as generous offers. “You are leading your people and the region to a catastrophe,” former US President Bill Clinton famously told the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat when he refused a peace deal proposed at Camp David in 2000.

But Palestinians contend that those offers, no matter how generous by Israeli standards, never went far enough. Israel has always had the military and diplomatic edge in the conflict, with a powerful ally in the US. And Palestinians have been forced to progressively narrow their conception of acceptable peace, let alone a fair peace, especially as Israel treats its territorial expansion as a fait accompli and normalizes relations with Arab countries that had previously fought for the Palestinian cause.

“Palestinians wonder whether they are always doomed to accept what they have previously refused just to find that it is no more an offer — if it ever was an offer — again to be faced with new attempts to extort new concessions from them for an undefined future,” writes Palestinian diplomat Afif Safieh in his 2011 book, ​​The Peace Process: From Breakthrough to Breakdown.

Here is what you need to know about the history of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and why they have repeatedly failed.

In 1967, Israel fought Egypt, Syria, and Jordan in the Six-Day War, a brief but intense conflict over water, land, and Palestine. Israel defeated the three Arab states, capturing Gaza, the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula, parts of East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights.

Following the conflict, the UN adopted Resolution 242, which calls on Arab countries to recognize Israel’s right to “live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force,” as well as for Israel to withdraw from “territories occupied” in the conflict — essentially, to revert to its pre-1967 borders, a provision that Israel has since resisted.

Israel, Egypt, and Jordan all came to accept the resolution, ushering in temporary peace between them. Egypt and Jordan recognized Israel’s existence and ceased direct hostilities with the country, though Israel didn’t uphold its part of the deal, never fully reverting to its pre-1967 borders — a choice that led to the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

Still, achieving buy-in from Arab nations that were once hostile to Israel was a significant step toward opening formal Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. The resolution was later affirmed in 1973 in UN Resolution 338, which, along with resolution 242, served as the foundation of peace talks in the region for decades to come.

The Camp David Accords established long-lasting (but cold) peace between Egypt and Israel, and also had a significant impact on the trajectory of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.

The Accords, brokered by then-US President Jimmy Carter, came after a ceasefire in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which Egypt and Syria fought Israel, hoping to regain territory lost in previous conflicts. As part of the deal, Egypt and Israel agreed to refrain from use of force to resolve their disputes, and Israel agreed to a path toward returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. (Syria signed a separate disengagement agreement with Israel.)

Israel and Egypt also addressed the fate of Palestinians: They reiterated their commitment to UN Resolutions 242 and 338. Both countries called for Palestinians to participate in future negotiations, “full autonomy” for people in the West Bank and Gaza, a provisional government in those territories supported by Israeli security forces, and negotiations to determine Palestinians’ final status within five years. Palestinians were not formally invited to participate in the talks because the US refused to deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization, an umbrella group for Palestinian nationalists, so long as they refused to acknowledge Israel’s right to exist and to renounce terrorism.

The Accords are considered a major watershed moment in Middle East peacemaking — earning then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat Nobel Peace Prizes — and provided a blueprint for subsequent negotiations.

However, while Israel successfully kept the peace with Egypt, it did not abide by its commitments to Palestinians in the Accords. The five-year deadline for beginning to grant Palestinian people autonomy within the West Bank and Gaza came and went, and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories ballooned.

Carter writes in his 2006 book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid that by “remov[ing] Egypt’s considerable strength from the military equation of the Middle East,” Israel “permitted itself renewed freedom to pursue the goals of a fervent and dedicated minority of its citizens to confiscate, settle, and fortify the occupied territories.”

Historians — including Seth Anziska, author of the 2018 book Preventing Palestine — have also argued that the Accords had the effect of limiting remedies available to the Palestinians by focusing on establishing an ill-defined goal of “full autonomy” rather than sovereignty.

Essentially, the Accords successfully kept war from breaking out between Israel and Egypt. But in the view of Carter and others critical of the deal’s limitations, the agreement also removed incentives Israel may have had to pursue peace with the Palestinians, setting the stage for the next few decades of difficulties.

1988: Amid the First Intifada, Arafat acknowledges Israel’s right to exist

In 1987, Palestinian frustrations had reached a boiling point following Israel’s invasion of Lebanon to root out the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) presence there, the construction of new Israeli settlements, and increased repression by Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians staged their First Intifada, Arabic for “shaking off,” engaging in nonviolent mass protests that often turned into violent clashes with Israeli security forces. It was amid this fighting that Hamas rose in prominence, initially committing to a nonviolent strategy alongside the PLO to facilitate peace talks.

With the intifada unfolding, PLO leader Yasser Arafat, known as the father of Palestinian nationalism, made an announcement that paved the way for direct negotiations with the Israelis.

Arafat said that the PLO, which had previously sought to defeat and replace the state of Israel — often via violent means, like airplane hijackings and bombings of Jewish civilians across the globe — had ‘’accepted the existence of Israel as a state in the region’’ and ‘’declared its rejection and condemnation of terrorism in all its forms.’’

“We accept two states, the Palestine state and the Jewish state of Israel,” he said.

Though the initial reception from the US and Israel was icy, it was a significant capitulation. The PLO was still widely regarded as a terrorist group, including by the US, following the announcement. But it would begin to take a more active role in determining the future of the Palestinians.

In 1991, representatives from the US, Soviet Union, Israel, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, as well as non-PLO Palestinian delegates, convened for the first time in Madrid to hold negotiations to create a new framework for the peace process. The conference was conceived by then-US Secretary of State James Baker to change course from a continued pattern of conflict during the final years of the First Intifada.

There were still significant disagreements between the US and Israel around what peace should look like, particularly on settlement expansion, and no formal agreements came of the conference.

But “what Madrid did achieve was significant,” write George Mitchell, former US President Barack Obama’s special envoy for Middle East peace, and Alon Sachar, a Middle East expert and former adviser to the US Ambassador to Israel, in the 2016 book A Path to Peace. That included bolstering public support for negotiations in Israel, which elected Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister in 1992 on a platform that focused on Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. Together, Rabin’s election and the hope generated in Madrid laid the groundwork for the first major breakthrough in decades.

The year 1993 marked a breakthrough that established the modern peace process as we know it.

The PLO and Israel entered secret negotiations — facilitated by Norwegian politicians through a think tank in Oslo — at a moment when both felt backed into a corner. Israel was facing increasing international pressure to engage in peace talks following its violent clampdowns on Palestinian protesters in the intifada. And the PLO was weakened after supporting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein before his defeat by US and international forces in the First Gulf War. The fall of the Soviet Union had also reduced Cold War tensions in the Middle East that had previously made peacemaking difficult.

The secret talks allowed the negotiators to discuss difficult issues without fear of political blowback. After some progress had been made, the Israelis elevated them to official, public negotiations in Oslo. Then-US President Bill Clinton had a limited role in the negotiations, but held a formal signing ceremony for the so-called Oslo Accords on the White House lawn in Washington, DC, in 1993, in which Rabin and Arafat famously shook hands.

The Accords allowed Palestinians to self-govern in the West Bank and Gaza and established the Palestinian Authority as the government of those areas. Israel agreed to withdraw its security forces from Gaza and “redeploy” those located in the West Bank in phases. In exchange, the PLO formally recognized the state of Israel and the right of its citizens to live in peace, accepting the language of UN Resolution 242. “To this day Palestinians refer to their acquiescence to 242 as their historic compromise, the moment they accepted partition,” Mitchell and Sachar write.

Critically, the PLO failed to limit Israel’s continued military presence in Gaza and the West Bank in key ways. The agreement provided no timeline for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and gave Israelis exclusive jurisdiction over their settlements in the occupied territories. At this time, the settler population there exceeded 280,000 and would increase by almost 70,000 in the following five years.

Meanwhile, the Palestinians were left to manage their own affairs, including administering security and public services, relieving Israel of “formal responsibility for the living conditions and welfare of the territories’ rapidly increasing population, still completely dominated by Israeli forces,” Carter writes.

The Accords also established a five-year interim period in which the thornier issues of the conflict were meant to be resolved once and for all: the fate of a Palestinian state and its borders, whether Palestinian refugees would be able to return to Israel or the Palestinian territories or be compensated, what would happen to Israeli settlers and Jerusalem, and water usage. But that would never come to be.

Oslo II built on the momentum of the first Oslo agreement, which was received positively by both Palestinians and Israelis. In September 1995, Rabin and Arafat convened to sign a second agreement in DC that divided the West Bank into three zones, labeled Areas A, B, and C, keeping Gaza continuous. The hope was that, eventually, the Palestinian state would be formed in these areas.

The newly created Palestinian Authority (PA) was given full control over Area A, which encompassed the Palestinian cities of Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus, and Bethlehem. In Area B, which spans a dense zone around those Area A cities, the Palestinian Authority was to have civil jurisdiction in partnership with Israel, which would administer security. Area C, which represented most of the West Bank (and encompassed all of the settlements that Israel had built since it captured the territory in 1967) was to be administered entirely by Israel. Israel was still permitted to collect taxes from the many Palestinians living anywhere in the West Bank and Gaza if they worked in Israel, which it would then distribute to the PA. The Israelis had agreed to withdraw from most of Gaza ahead of Oslo II.

Rabin also agreed that Israel would withdraw from Areas A and B within three months of the signing of the agreement, and would negotiate further withdrawals in the five-year interim period established in the first Oslo agreement.

Radicals on both sides sought to prevent both Oslo I and II’s implementation. Rabin, who had become the face of the peace movement in Israel, was assassinated by a Jewish extremist who opposed the Accords just months later. A period of heightened attacks by Hamas followed. Public support for the peace process eroded, leading to Netanyahu’s election as prime minister in 1996. He opposed the Oslo Accords, arguing they only encouraged attacks like those Hamas was launching at the time, and that Israel needed to take a hard line against the Palestinians. He also distrusted the PLO’s Arafat, a feeling that was mutual.

Netanyahu’s first government wasn’t as far right as his latest one, but decisions he made in the years to come would make negotiations increasingly difficult.

Following Rabin’s assassination and Netanyahu’s election, the Accords were threatened, and Clinton tried to salvage the negotiations by inviting Arafat and Netanyahu to Maryland’s Wye River plantation in 1998. There, the leaders agreed to additional Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank as well as Palestinians taking measures to prevent violence against Israel — but both sides accused each other of failing to properly implement the agreement.

That contributed to a deteriorating political situation in Israel, where Netanyahu was facing criticism from the left for failing to make enough progress on negotiations and from the right for making what they saw as unreasonable territorial concessions. Netanyahu was subsequently voted out in 1999, with Ehud Barak taking his place as prime minister and promising an agreement with the Palestinians within 15 months.

At Barak’s urging, Clinton held another summit at Camp David in July 2000, where the leaders failed to come to an agreement on borders, Jerusalem, and Palestinian refugees’ “right of return.” Why they failed is a subject of disagreement: Clinton and other pro-Israel voices have blamed Arafat, arguing that he was unwilling to make peace, while others say the negotiations were designed to fail because they didn’t meet the “minimum requirements of any Palestinian leader,” as Robert Malley, one of the US negotiators, argued several years later. It was nevertheless a blow to Barak, who would not survive long as prime minister.

The failures of Camp David led Clinton to undertake a last ditch effort to salvage negotiations before he left office. At the outset of a Second Intifada, which would prove more bloody than the last, Clinton proposed his own parameters for peace.

In Clinton’s plan, 80 percent of Israeli settlers would remain in the West Bank, covering about 10 percent of the occupied land. Israel would have exclusive access to the utilities and certain roads that serviced them and would be allowed to create a security perimeter around the settlements. Palestinians would get some land adjacent to Gaza in exchange.

The rest of the West Bank would go to the new state of Palestine, which would also encompass all of Gaza. The new country would be demilitarized and supported by an international force. Palestinians would control the Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, including what is known to Muslims as the al-Aqsa Mosque, and Israelis would control the Western Wall.

Displaced Palestinians from around the world would have the right to return to the West Bank and Gaza, but not to their former homes in any land owned by Israel. Israel has generally opposed a right of return for Palestinians, which it “views as a tactic to undermine Jewish self-determination,” Mitchell and Sachar write. The return of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced in 1948 would erode Israel’s Jewish demographic majority.

Israel accepted the framework with reservations that Clinton said were “within [his] parameters.” Arafat also accepted the parameters but with reservations that Clinton deemed incongruous with an agreement. Part of the problem for Arafat was that the parameters required too many Palestinian concessions on land for settlers and on right of return, some foreign affairs experts have argued.

Clinton later wrote in his memoir that Arafat had made an “error of historic proportions.”

Carter saw Arafat’s decision differently, writing that “there was no possibility that any Palestinian leader could accept such terms and survive, but official statements from Washington and Jerusalem were successful in placing the entire onus for the failure on Yasser Arafat.”

This was the closest that the Israelis and Palestinians have come in recent years to achieving a peace agreement.

2002-2003: Various frameworks for peace are developed

The Second Intifada, which ended with a ceasefire in 2003 following significant loss of life, made official peace overtures difficult. But several initiatives that were not orchestrated by Israeli or Palestinian government representatives were nevertheless pursued during this period.

That included the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative proposed by the Saudi Crown Prince, which proposed Arab nations’ recognition of Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from the occupied territories, among other elements of a peace plan. It was embraced by many Arab countries and Palestinian leaders, but dismissed by the new Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s government as a “nonstarter” just as it was launching a major invasion of the West Bank in response to the Second Intifada. There was also the 2003 Geneva Initiative, spearheaded by former Israeli and Palestinian officials, which aimed to provide a comprehensive plan for implementation of a two-state solution based on the framework discussed in the Clinton Parameters and the Arab Peace Initiative. It was also rejected by Sharon.

The US, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations — together, the Quartet — also announced a roadmap for peace in 2003 that described progressive steps toward a two-state solution over the course of three years, with political, security, economic, humanitarian, and institution-building benchmarks.

The roadmap was grounded in then-US President George W. Bush’s belief that Palestinian militant violence was a primary obstacle to peace. He and the international community therefore demanded that Arafat step aside in favor of new Palestinian leadership to continue negotiations. At the time, there were still significant numbers of suicide bombings on Israeli and Jewish targets committed by Palestinian militants. Arafat agreed to step aside; the more moderate Mahmoud Abbas replaced him.

The Palestinians accepted the roadmap — despite the fact that Bush had made assurances to the Israelis that they would not be expected to totally withdraw from the occupied territories and that Palestinians would not have right of return to Israel. But the Israeli government, led by Sharon, demanded prerequisites that ultimately doomed the deal. Those included dismantling all Palestinian militant groups, precluding any reference to UN Resolution 242, and barring discussion of Israeli settlements.

“The practical result of all this is that the Roadmap for Peace had become moot,” Carter writes.

2005: Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza and some settlements in the West Bank

Despite previously advocating for expansionist policies in the occupied territories, Sharon announced an Israeli “disengagement plan” for Gaza in 2005 that involved the unilateral withdrawal of Israeli settlements and military forces. However, Israel maintained control of the Gazan airspace and cooperated with Egypt in administering its border with Gaza.

Approximately 8,500 Israeli settlers — some of whom had lived there for decades and resisted the plan — were removed from their homes, and some were compensated. Israel ceded control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, who was elected its president that year. Israel also vacated four Israeli settlements in the West Bank.

The move was surprising from Sharon, who had for years pursued a dream of a “Greater Israel,” understood by many Israelis as their biblical lands that encompass the Palestinian territories. It earned him a reputation as a peacemaker who was seeking to deescalate the situation. But as Dartmouth professor Bernard Avishai later argued in the New Yorker, the decision was “not meant to precede a negotiated settlement of any kind but to obviate the need for one.”

Sharon wanted to “cut Israel’s losses” in Gaza, Avishai argues, while pursuing his long-term goals of annexing Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, and all major Israeli settlements in the West Bank, pushing the Palestinians well beyond Israel’s 1967 borders and behind the illegal “separation barrier” he had built. Sharon, however, suffered from a stroke soon after that would leave him incapable of fully carrying out that vision.

Hamas won a majority in the PA in the 2006 elections following the withdrawal. The US refused to recognize their new government and pressured Abbas’s government to overturn the results, helping spark a brief civil war that culminated in the group taking control of Gaza while the PA, led by politicians aligned with Abbas, continued to govern in the West Bank.

After the schism in the Palestinian government, Ehud Olmert, who became Israel’s prime minister after Sharon suffered from a stroke, decided to reopen peace talks with the PA in Annapolis, Maryland, for the first time since 2000.

Hamas supported the talks and was prepared to reverse its policy of rejecting Israel if an agreement that the Palestinian people would approve of could be finalized.

Olmert presented a proposal to Abbas that included significant territorial concessions, though the exact contours of the proposal are vague and were never fully disclosed. Reportedly, Olmert offered Palestinians 5.8 percent of Israeli land, consisting of lightly populated farmland, in exchange for 6.3 percent of the West Bank, encompassing major Israeli settlements. On other issues, however, there appeared to still be significant gaps between the Israeli and Palestinian positions on refugees, Jerusalem, and an Israeli withdrawal.

Abbas did not accept the proposal, later saying he wasn’t provided enough detail, though Olmert speculates that Abbas was “entirely for it” and believes Abbas likely regrets that he did not sign the deal. In that respect, Abbas’s rejection of the offer is sometimes compared to Arafat’s reaction to the Clinton Parameters: It was “the best an Israeli prime minister had ever offered to a Palestinian leader” in terms of territory, Mitchell and Sachar write. But Abbas later stated that he believed the offer did not meet Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.

Some reports suggest that Abbas was also concerned about the political situation in Israel at the time, as Olmert had announced his intention to resign over corruption allegations. Olmert later served a prison sentence for accepting bribes and committing obstruction of justice. Netanyahu succeeded him and rejected the talks as dangerous for Israel, raising questions as to whether he would have honored any agreement signed.

Obama’s presidency began in 2009 with the ending of a Gaza war, known as Israel’s Operation Cast Lead, and he appointed George Mitchell, co-author of the 2016 book A Path to Peace, to shepherd peace talks. But the Israeli government was skeptical of Obama, and the heft Mitchell brought as a former negotiator with Northern Ireland did not directly translate to Israel and Palestine.

It quickly became clear Obama’s peace overtures weren’t working. Senior US officials had begun warning that because of the pace of Israel’s settlement expansion, the horizon of the two-state outcome was approaching, and human rights organizations were increasingly calling the situation in the West Bank apartheid. US Secretary of State John Kerry put his hat in the ring, setting a deadline of mid-2014 to reach a comprehensive agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.

Kerry started with a series of confidence-building measures: Israel agreed to progressively release Palestinian prisoners in four parts while Palestinians agreed to halt the process of applying for membership as a country in international bodies. However, when Israel refused to release the fourth group of prisoners and continued to expand its settlements, Abbas reacted by applying for Palestine to be recognized by 15 UN and other international bodies.

Both sides also faced opposition within their own camps. Hamas rejected the talks, saying that Abbas had no authority to negotiate on behalf of Palestinians since no formal elections had been held in the Palestinian territories since 2005. The group called for a third intifada, though it never materialized.

Netanyahu’s Likud party proposed legislation to annex the Jordan Valley in direct contradiction of the US’s proposal during the talks that the area go to Palestinians. Hardliners also threatened to resign from Netanyahu’s government if he agreed to Israel’s 1967 borders as a starting point for negotiations.

These challenges led to a breakdown in the talks in April 2014.

Former President Donald Trump severely undermined the prospect of Palestinian autonomy, delivering several major wins for Israel that poisoned dialogue with the Palestinians.

He recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights, which Syria says should rightfully be its property — a decision later reaffirmed under Biden. He reversed decades of US policy and moved the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018 — a decision made in recognition of the fact that Israel had made unified Jerusalem its capital, but that ignores Palestinian claims on East Jerusalem that are recognized by the UN. It’s now incredibly politically difficult for any American president to move the embassy back to Tel Aviv.

The Trump administration also argued in 2019 that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are not necessarily illegal, lending legitimacy to Israel’s claims on the territories. Israel’s annexations and settlements are widely regarded as illegal under international law, and no other country has recognized them.

Though Trump unveiled a plan in 2020 that he hailed as the peace “deal of the century,” Palestinians vehemently rejected it. The proposal would have allowed Israel to absorb the vast majority of settlements in the occupied West Bank, home to more than half a million Israelis, required that Palestine be fully demilitarized, and rejected Palestinian refugees’ right of return outright. It would have also recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, while also impossibly recognizing Jerusalem as the “undivided capital” of Israel.

“We say a thousand nos to the Deal of The Century,” Abbas said at the time.

Trump’s barefaced pro-Israel policies undermined the US’s ability to credibly moderate peace talks going forward. There’s also no one credible representative for Palestinians across the occupied territories with which to negotiate. Polling in recent years but before Hamas’s October 7 attack has shown that the PA, under Abbas’s leadership, is broadly unpopular when compared with Hamas, and as Mitchell and Sachar note, has become seen as “behaving like a security subcontractor easing the burden for Israel of the occupation.” That’s partially by the design of Netanyahu, who has propped up Hamas at the expense of a unified Palestinian voice in peace talks.

Even if there were strong representatives, Trump wasn’t interested in pursuing a peace plan. His administration created the Abraham Accords, which were normalization deals between Israel and Arab states like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco (Arab states that had previously not recognized Israel); such deals did not include any progress on the Palestinian issue. Biden took up this policy, and his team put a major emphasis on bringing Saudi Arabia into the normalization fold during his first two and a half years in office. This Trump-Biden approach went against the Arab Peace Initiative and cut Palestinians out of the conversation.

2023: The US renews calls for a two-state solution

For years after Trump announced his framework, no meaningful attempts were made to reopen peace negotiations, with US President Joe Biden looking to turn his attention to other parts of the world, including China and Russia, and Israel signing normalization agreements with some of its Arab neighbors.

But that calculus changed with the onset of the war in Gaza. The Biden administration has offered its nearly unconditional support to Israel, but has raised concerns about Israel’s ability to achieve its stated goal of eliminating Hamas and its methods as civilian casualties skyrocket. It has also called for a renewed commitment to a two-state solution.

The Biden administration’s focus on a two-state solution raises the question as to whether the window for that path to peace has passed. Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories has become entrenched, and its settler population in the West Bank has grown to at least 700,000, leading some observers — including Carter — to argue that the reality is that Israel and Palestine are a de facto one state.

“A system of apartheid, with two peoples occupying the same land but completely separated from each other, with Israelis totally dominant and suppressing violence by depriving Palestinians of their basic human rights. This is the policy now being followed,” Carter wrote in his 2006 book.

As the war continues, Biden has called on Israel to disentangle itself from Palestine, and has warned the country against trying to occupy Gaza once it concludes its offensive. But Following Hamas’s October 7 attack and the destruction Israel has wreaked in Gaza, reversing the status quo now seems more difficult than ever."

Israel’s national security adviser said late Wednesday that cease-fire talks with the Hamas militant group were still ongoing, and the hostage release will not take place before Friday. Tzachi Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

The cease-fire agreement between the Hamas militant group and Israel had earlier been confirmed by both parties, along with Washington and Qatar, which helped broker the deal that would bring a temporary halt to the devastating war that is now in its seventh week.

The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas will free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages taken in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel will release some Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Egyptian state media say the truce will begin Thursday morning. Egypt helped mediate the cease-fire agreement, which would bring the first respite to war-weary Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Wednesday he told U.S. President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with the war after a cease-fire expires. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United States military says one of its warships in the Red Sea has shot down bomb-carrying drones launched from territory controlled by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.

The military arm of Yemen’s Houthi rebels said earlier Wednesday that it launched a batch of long-range large missiles toward southern Israel, including the Red Sea city of Eilat. The Iran-backed rebel group has launched at least six aerial attacks against Israel since the conflict broke out on Oct. 7.

The Houthi are staunch foes of Israel and have vowed to continue aerial attacks and hijackings of Israeli ships.

The American military’s Central Command said the USS Thomas Hudner, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, shot down the drones early Thursday morning.

“The ship and crew sustained no damage or injury,” Central Command said, but did not identify what it believed the drones were targeting.

BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon late Wednesday is believed to have killed the son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc in Lebanon, Mohammed Raad. Hezbollah announced early Thursday that five of its fighters were killed, among them Abbas Mohammed Raad, identified by local media as the son of the legislator.

The Lebanese militant group has a political wing that has long held seats in the country’s parliament.

The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli airstrike on a house in the town of Beit Yahoun late Wednesday killed four people and wounded one. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike.

On Wednesday, Hamas announced that Khalil Kharraz, a commander of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon, was killed in an Israeli airstrike the day before. Also on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike killed two journalists from the pan-Arab TV channel Al Mayadeen as they were reporting in south Lebanon. The Israeli military has said it is looking into the incident.

The Lebanon-Israel border has seen daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. While mostly limited to the border area, the clashes have stirred fears of a wider regional war.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser says a planned hostage-for-prisoner swap with Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.

In a statement released late Wednesday, Tzachi Hanegbi said that contacts on the deal were continuing. “The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday,” he said.

The swap is to take place as part of a four-day truce expected to begin on Thursday.

Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has instructed the country’s Mossad spy agency to track down the leadership of the Hamas militant group living in other countries outside Gaza.

“I have instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas, wherever they are,” Netanyahu told a news conference.

Most of Hamas’ top leadership lives in exile, primarily in the Gulf state of Qatar and the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The Mossad has been accused in a series of assassinations overseas of Palestinian militants and Iranian nuclear scientists over the years.

CAIRO — The U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that almost 1,037,000 internally displaced Palestinians were currently seeking shelter in 156 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip.

In its report, the aid agency said that the number of its workers killed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza stands at 108. The information in the report was valid as of Tuesday.

Earlier Wednesday, UNRWA’s Secretary General, Philippe Lazzarini, gave a press conference in southern Gaza warning that the suffering of Palestinians will only worsen with the coming of winter, and that the besieged territory is on the verge of a waterborne disease outbreak.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a temporary truce was agreed between Israel and Hamas that will facilitate the release of dozens of people taken hostage during the militant group’s assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

The move has been welcomed by UNRWA whose leaders have continually called for a cease-fire.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with Israel’s war against Hamas after a temporary cease-fire expires.

Netanyahu said he delivered the message to Biden in a phone call on Wednesday.

“I want to be clear. The war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals,” Netanyahu said.

A four-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is expected to take effect on Thursday.

Hamas can extend the truce by releasing more of the hostages it is holding.

But Netanyahu, along with the other members of his special war cabinet, told a press conference they will resume the war until Hamas is destroyed and all of the 240 hostages it is holding are released.

JERUSALEM — The Israeli army says it has released an award-winning Palestinian poet it detained in Gaza.

Mosab Abu Toha has been contributing pieces to western media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire picture of its toll on civilians through his personal experience.

His family announced Monday that Abu Toha had been arrested while evacuating to southern Gaza from his home in the hard-hit Jabaliya refugee camp. Abu Toha last posted to X on Nov. 15, writing: “Alive. Thanks for your prayers.”

Diana Buttu, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and friend of the family, said Abu Toha was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint and held for two days with dozens of other Palestinians at an Israeli detention center. She says he was was accused of having Hamas connections and beaten up in custody. She said he was released on Tuesday, apparently after the case attracted international attention.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that Abu Toha had been released. It gave no further details.

Buttu said Abu Toha was safe in central Gaza after receiving medical treatment. The poet, whose son is an American citizen, is trying to leave the besieged territory.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — More than 100 bodies were buried Wednesday in a mass grave in Khan Younis, the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheets fastened with cable ties.

Medical workers placed dozens of bodies brought from various areas in northern Gaza, including Shifa Hospital, into a huge trench that was dug using a bulldozer.

Workers wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the bodies to the grave and performed funeral prayers.

GENEVA — International aid groups that have lined up thousands of aid trucks for Gaza say they’re ready to move quickly to send in food, water and other supplies during an agreed, but yet undated, pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Details remain unclear about both the mechanics of getting more aid for beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza and the possible release of hostages kidnapped from Israel whose families have desperately sought their release.

“The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to the fine print of the announced deal.

Della Longa lamented bottlenecks that have confounded the scant deliveries of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He said IFRC hopes that a deal would include provisions to allow for a “faster track” of aid shipments.

The only route for international humanitarian aid into Gaza since Oct. 7 has been through the Rafah Crossing into Egypt, and planeloads of supplies have been flown into the nearby Egyptian city of El-Arish — and trucks have queued up near Gaza, where intense Israeli inspections of trucks and cargo have slowed entry.

WASHINGTON — A major Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq has warned it may strike additional U.S. targets after U.S. warplanes killed multiple militants in response to the first use of short-range ballistic missiles against U.S. forces at Al-Asad Air Base earlier this week.

U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and a Kataib Hezbollah command and control node south of Baghdad on Tuesday, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional sensitive details of the attacks.

There were Kataib Hezbollah personnel at both sites at the time of the strikes, but the officials said they could not yet confirm whether anyone there was killed.

Militia officials in Iraq said the attack had killed eight Kataib Hezbollah members.

Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday that it was considering “expanding the scope of targets” if the U.S. military continues with its strikes, adding that the attack “will not go unpunished.”

The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities on Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. The attacks have continued unabated since, with at least 66 rocket and missile attacks hitting U.S. facilities and wounding at least 62 service members.

Associated Press writers Tara Copp in Washington, D.C., and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed.

GENEVA — Switzerland’s executive branch said Wednesday it will ask parliament to ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The Federal Council said the government will also end contracts it has with three Palestinian non-governmental organizations. They were among 11 Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that had been under review by Swiss officials following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.

Four days after the deadly rampage in Israel, the council moved to designate Hamas as a terrorist group and instructed the Foreign Ministry to consider a possible ban.

The seven-member council, which includes the Swiss president, reiterated its condemnation of the attacks “in the strongest possible terms” and expressed its regret about the deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict.

The United States and the European Union, which does not count Switzerland as a member, have long considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on the international community to provide “timely and sustained humanitarian assistance” to the Palestinians in Gaza.

Modi was speaking at a virtual meeting of Group of 20 nations on Wednesday before India’s presidency ends on Nov. 30.

“We agree that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians anywhere is condemnable,” Modi said. “We welcome the news today concerning the release of the hostages. We hope that all the hostages will be released soon.”

Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war in Gaza — a breakthrough that will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and bring a large influx of aid to the besieged territory, officials said Wednesday.

“It is important to provide timely and sustained humanitarian assistance. It is also important to ensure that the war between Israel and Hamas does not take any regional form,” Modi said.

CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says the Israel-Hamas truce will take effect at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) Thursday.

Egypt helped mediate the four-day cease-fire, which will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The deal will also see the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israeli media also reported that the truce would begin Thursday at 10 a.m.

CAIRO — The World Health Organization has documented 178 attacks on healthcare facilities that killed 553 people, including 22 healthcare workers, since the war started on Oct. 7, the agency’s regional director said Wednesday.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari said in an online briefing that about 800 people, including 48 healthcare workers, were injured in the attacks, which damaged 24 hospitals and 32 ambulances.

The war has forced the shutdown of 27 out of 36 hospitals and 47 out of 72 primary health care clinics across Gaza, he said. The facilities stopping providing services mainly because of a lack of fuel and attacks, he said.

“Hospitals must be allowed to replenish the resources they need to continue functioning,” he said. “We cannot keep providing drops of aid in an ocean of needs.”

CAIRO — The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering.

It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers.

The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike.

Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.”

Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives.

WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.”

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.”

In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives in Gaza.

Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath.

Francis said: “Here we’ve gone beyond war. This isn’t war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.”

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s Justice Ministry has published a list of 300 Palestinian detainees and prisoners who could potentially be released in a hostage deal.

Most of those on the list published Wednesday are teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses, including throwing rocks or alleged incitement. None was convicted of murder, though some served sentences for attempted murder.

The youngest detainee on the list is 14, and it also includes around 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

According to the truce-for-hostages deal announced Wednesday, 50 hostages will be released over four days, likely starting Thursday, during which fighting will pause.

After that, every additional 10 hostages released will result in one additional day in the pause and the release of additional Palestinian prisoners.

Israel is expected to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in the first four days, though the Ministry of Justice published the list of 300 in case the deal is extended. Under Israeli law, the public has 24 hours to object to any release.

CAIRO — The evacuation of patients trapped in Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has begun, the Palestinian Red Crescent says.

The charity said 14 ambulances arrived at the hospital on Wednesday, and the evacuation has been coordinated with the United Nations and Doctors without Borders medical group.

Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, has said there were over 250 patients at the facility, which was besieged by the Israeli military earlier this month. Over 400 displaced people sheltering in the facility have also been trapped there, he said.

Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital, the largest in Gaza, to conduct militant operations. Hamas and health officials have denied the allegation.

Over the weekend, the World Health Organization coordinated the evacuation of 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza. Of them, 28 babies were later transferred to Egypt.

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s crisis management chief has welcomed the Israeli hostage release agreement and says the halt in fighting that is part of the deal must be used to flood Gaza with desperately needed aid.

“We hope that the agreement on a pause of hostilities that has just been reached will allow for a substantial surge in humanitarian aid delivery into and within Gaza,” Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic said Wednesday.

“We certainly hope that this will not be a one-off,” he told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, and called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses throughout Gaza.”

The 27-nation EU is the world’s biggest aid donor to the Palestinians. Lenarcic said 15 EU aid cargo flights have been sent, with most of that aid already in Gaza, and that more is on the way.

Lenarcic said getting into Gaza is “extremely challenging” and that fewer than 50 trucks a day make it through, a number which he described as “woefully inadequate.” He welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some fuel in, but said it only covers about one third of Gaza’s basic needs.

LONDON — The British government has welcomed an agreement to release some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza and urged all parties to ensure it is “delivered in full.”

Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the agreement was “a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

“This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis,” he said. “The U.K. will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.”

BEIJING — The Chinese government says it welcomes the four-day truce reached between Israel and Hamas.

“We welcome the provisional truce reached by the parties concerned and hope it will help to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, de-escalate the conflict and ease tensions,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.

China has been calling for a cease-fire and refrained from criticizing the initial Hamas attack on Israel that started the latest conflict. A delegation of foreign ministers from Arab nations and Indonesia held talks with China’s foreign minister this week as they started a tour to press their case for a cease-fire with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.

MOSCOW — The Kremlin on Wednesday hailed a deal between Israel and Hamas for a halt to the war and the release of hostages as step toward ending the hostilities.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the announcement of the deal was “the first good news from Gaza in a long time.”

Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he noted that Russia along with most other countries had called for a truce and humanitarian pauses, adding that “only on the basis of such pauses future attempts to find a lasting settlement to the problem could be made.”

PARIS — France’s foreign minister says she’s hopeful that French nationals will be among the first hostages released as part of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas.

“We hope that French nationals are among them and even, if possible, among the first group that will be released,” the minister, Catherine Colonna, said Wednesday on France Inter radio. “We are working for that.”

France counts eight people missing, some of them confirmed as hostages, from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants that ignited their latest and deadliest war. France also counts 40 killed in the attack. Colonna said that not all the hostages taken on Oct. 7 were captured by Hamas. But she said that in the course of negotiations, the militant group has said that “it could assemble together all of the hostages.”

In a message on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said “we are working tirelessly to ensure that all hostages are released.” He also hoped the truce will “enable aid to be brought in” and help the Gaza people.

ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey, a vocal critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza, welcomed the four-day truce as a “positive development to prevent more bloodshed.”

A Foreign Ministry statement released Wednesday said Turkey expects full compliance with the agreement.

“We hope that the humanitarian pause will help permanently end the current conflict as soon as possible and initiate a process towards a just and lasting peace based on a two-state solution,” it said.

BAGHDAD — The United States military said Wednesday that it has carried out strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have launched attacks on U.S. forces.

The U.S. Central Command said in a statement Wednesday that its forces had “conducted discrete, precision strikes against two facilities in Iraq … in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups,” including one on Tuesday involving the use of close-range ballistic missiles.

Two officials with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said the strikes hit three locations in the area of Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad, killing eight members of the Kataeb Hezbollah militant group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Iranian-backed militants have launched dozens of attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. While most of the more than five dozen attacks have been ineffective, at least 60 U.S. personnel have reported minor injuries. The militant groups have said the strikes are in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

ROME — Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted a town hall meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday, booing and heckling him when he addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The protesters chanted “Shame on you” and accused Kristersson of supporting genocide after he said Sweden condemns Hamas and supports Israel’s right to self-defense. Police removed some of them from the venue in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second biggest city.

Kristersson criticized the protesters in a Facebook post after the event.

“When we met tonight with a few hundred Gothenburgers the meeting was disrupted by a screaming and shouting group of people who refused to respect everyone else who had come to ask questions,” he wrote. “These political saboteurs appeared to have come to our question-and-answer session only to shout out their anger over Sweden and the EU’s political position about the conflict in the Middle East -– they were particularly disappointed over the condemnation of the terror organization Hamas.”

Kristersson’s center-right government has strongly sided with Israel in the Gaza conflict, condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and supporting Israel’s right to self-defense. Pro-Palestinian groups and the left-leaning opposition have accused the government of ignoring the plight of Palestinian civilians."
1141866230,20231122,"Israel’s national security adviser said late Wednesday that cease-fire talks with the Hamas militant group were still ongoing, and the hostage release will not take place before Friday. Tzachi Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

The cease-fire agreement between the Hamas militant group and Israel had earlier been confirmed by both parties, along with Washington and Qatar, which helped broker the deal that would bring a temporary halt to the devastating war that is now in its seventh week.

The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas will free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages taken in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel will release some Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Egyptian state media say the truce will begin Thursday morning. Egypt helped mediate the cease-fire agreement, which would bring the first respite to war-weary Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Wednesday he told U.S. President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with the war after a cease-fire expires. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas.

US DESTROYER SHOOTS DOWN BOMB-CARRYING DRONES LAUNCHED FROM HOUTHI-CONTROLLED TERRITORY

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United States military says one of its warships in the Red Sea has shot down bomb-carrying drones launched from territory controlled by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.

The military arm of Yemen’s Houthi rebels said earlier Wednesday that it launched a batch of long-range large missiles toward southern Israel, including the Red Sea city of Eilat. The Iran-backed rebel group has launched at least six aerial attacks against Israel since the conflict broke out on Oct. 7.

The Houthi are staunch foes of Israel and have vowed to continue aerial attacks and hijackings of Israeli ships.

The American military’s Central Command said the USS Thomas Hudner, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, shot down the drones early Thursday morning.

“The ship and crew sustained no damage or injury,” Central Command said, but did not identify what it believed the drones were targeting.

ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE IN SOUTH LEBANON BELIEVED TO HAVE KILLED SON OF HEAD OF HEZBOLLAH'S PARLIAMENTARY BLOC

BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon late Wednesday is believed to have killed the son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc in Lebanon, Mohammed Raad. Hezbollah announced early Thursday that five of its fighters were killed, among them Abbas Mohammed Raad, identified by local media as the son of the legislator.

The Lebanese militant group has a political wing that has long held seats in the country’s parliament.

The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli airstrike on a house in the town of Beit Yahoun late Wednesday killed four people and wounded one. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike.

On Wednesday, Hamas announced that Khalil Kharraz, a commander of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon, was killed in an Israeli airstrike the day before. Also on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike killed two journalists from the pan-Arab TV channel Al Mayadeen as they were reporting in south Lebanon. The Israeli military has said it is looking into the incident.

The Lebanon-Israel border has seen daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. While mostly limited to the border area, the clashes have stirred fears of a wider regional war.

ISRAEL SAYS CEASE-FIRE TALKS ARE ONGOING AND HOSTAGE RELEASE WON'T HAPPEN BEFORE FRIDAY

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser says a planned hostage-for-prisoner swap with Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.

In a statement released late Wednesday, Tzachi Hanegbi said that contacts on the deal were continuing. “The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday,” he said.

The swap is to take place as part of a four-day truce expected to begin on Thursday.

Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

NETANYAHU SAYS SPY AGENCY WILL ACT AGAINSt HAMAS LEADERS OVERSEAS

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has instructed the country's Mossad spy agency to track down the leadership of the Hamas militant group living in other countries outside Gaza.

“I have instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas, wherever they are,” Netanyahu told a news conference.

Most of Hamas’ top leadership lives in exile, primarily in the Gulf state of Qatar and the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The Mossad has been accused in a series of assassinations overseas of Palestinian militants and Iranian nuclear scientists over the years.

OVER A MILLION DISPLACED IN GAZA ARE SHELTERING IN UN FACILITIES

CAIRO — The U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that almost 1,037,000 internally displaced Palestinians were currently seeking shelter in 156 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip.

In its report, the aid agency said that the number of its workers killed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza stands at 108. The information in the report was valid as of Tuesday.

Earlier Wednesday, UNRWA’s Secretary General, Philippe Lazzarini, gave a press conference in southern Gaza warning that the suffering of Palestinians will only worsen with the coming of winter, and that the besieged territory is on the verge of a waterborne disease outbreak.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a temporary truce was agreed between Israel and Hamas that will facilitate the release of dozens of people taken hostage during the militant group’s assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

The move has been welcomed by UNRWA whose leaders have continually called for a cease-fire.

NETANYAHU VOWS WAR WILL KEEP GOING AFTER CEASE-FIRE

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with Israel’s war against Hamas after a temporary cease-fire expires.

Netanyahu said he delivered the message to Biden in a phone call on Wednesday.

“I want to be clear. The war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals,” Netanyahu said.

A four-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is expected to take effect on Thursday.

Hamas can extend the truce by releasing more of the hostages it is holding.

But Netanyahu, along with the other members of his special war cabinet, told a press conference they will resume the war until Hamas is destroyed and all of the 240 hostages it is holding are released.

ISRAEL RELEASES AWARD-WINNING PALESTINIAN POET WHO WAS DETAINED BY TROOPS IN GAZA

JERUSALEM — The Israeli army says it has released an award-winning Palestinian poet it detained in Gaza.

Mosab Abu Toha has been contributing pieces to western media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire picture of its toll on civilians through his personal experience.

His family announced Monday that Abu Toha had been arrested while evacuating to southern Gaza from his home in the hard-hit Jabaliya refugee camp. Abu Toha last posted to X on Nov. 15, writing: “Alive. Thanks for your prayers.”

Diana Buttu, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and friend of the family, said Abu Toha was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint and held for two days with dozens of other Palestinians at an Israeli detention center. She says he was was accused of having Hamas connections and beaten up in custody. She said he was released on Tuesday, apparently after the case attracted international attention.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that Abu Toha had been released. It gave no further details.

Buttu said Abu Toha was safe in central Gaza after receiving medical treatment. The poet, whose son is an American citizen, is trying to leave the besieged territory.

MASS GRAVE FOR OVER 100 PALESTINIANS DUG IN SOUTHERN GAZA

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — More than 100 bodies were buried Wednesday in a mass grave in Khan Younis, the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheets fastened with cable ties.

Medical workers placed dozens of bodies brought from various areas in northern Gaza, including Shifa Hospital, into a huge trench that was dug using a bulldozer.

Workers wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the bodies to the grave and performed funeral prayers.

GENEVA — International aid groups that have lined up thousands of aid trucks for Gaza say they’re ready to move quickly to send in food, water and other supplies during an agreed, but yet undated, pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Details remain unclear about both the mechanics of getting more aid for beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza and the possible release of hostages kidnapped from Israel whose families have desperately sought their release.

“The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to the fine print of the announced deal.

Della Longa lamented bottlenecks that have confounded the scant deliveries of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He said IFRC hopes that a deal would include provisions to allow for a “faster track” of aid shipments.

The only route for international humanitarian aid into Gaza since Oct. 7 has been through the Rafah Crossing into Egypt, and planeloads of supplies have been flown into the nearby Egyptian city of El-Arish — and trucks have queued up near Gaza, where intense Israeli inspections of trucks and cargo have slowed entry.

IRANIAN-BACKED MILITANT GROUP VOWS TO EXPAND CONFLICT IF US AIRSTRIKES CONTINUE

WASHINGTON — A major Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq has warned it may strike additional U.S. targets after U.S. warplanes killed multiple militants in response to the first use of short-range ballistic missiles against U.S. forces at Al-Asad Air Base earlier this week.

U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and a Kataib Hezbollah command and control node south of Baghdad on Tuesday, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional sensitive details of the attacks.

There were Kataib Hezbollah personnel at both sites at the time of the strikes, but the officials said they could not yet confirm whether anyone there was killed.

Militia officials in Iraq said the attack had killed eight Kataib Hezbollah members.

Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday that it was considering “expanding the scope of targets” if the U.S. military continues with its strikes, adding that the attack “will not go unpunished.”

The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities on Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. The attacks have continued unabated since, with at least 66 rocket and missile attacks hitting U.S. facilities and wounding at least 62 service members.

Associated Press writers Tara Copp in Washington, D.C., and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed.

SWISS PARLIAMENT TO CONSIDER BAN ON HAMAS

GENEVA — Switzerland’s executive branch said Wednesday it will ask parliament to ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The Federal Council said the government will also end contracts it has with three Palestinian non-governmental organizations. They were among 11 Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that had been under review by Swiss officials following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.

Four days after the deadly rampage in Israel, the council moved to designate Hamas as a terrorist group and instructed the Foreign Ministry to consider a possible ban.

The seven-member council, which includes the Swiss president, reiterated its condemnation of the attacks “in the strongest possible terms” and expressed its regret about the deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict.

The United States and the European Union, which does not count Switzerland as a member, have long considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on the international community to provide “timely and sustained humanitarian assistance” to the Palestinians in Gaza.

Modi was speaking at a virtual meeting of Group of 20 nations on Wednesday before India’s presidency ends on Nov. 30.

“We agree that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians anywhere is condemnable,"" Modi said. ""We welcome the news today concerning the release of the hostages. We hope that all the hostages will be released soon.”

Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war in Gaza — a breakthrough that will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and bring a large influx of aid to the besieged territory, officials said Wednesday.

“It is important to provide timely and sustained humanitarian assistance. It is also important to ensure that the war between Israel and Hamas does not take any regional form,” Modi said.

CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says the Israel-Hamas truce will take effect at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) Thursday.

Egypt helped mediate the four-day cease-fire, which will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The deal will also see the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israeli media also reported that the truce would begin Thursday at 10 a.m.

CAIRO — The World Health Organization has documented 178 attacks on healthcare facilities that killed 553 people, including 22 healthcare workers, since the war started on Oct. 7, the agency’s regional director said Wednesday.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari said in an online briefing that about 800 people, including 48 healthcare workers, were injured in the attacks, which damaged 24 hospitals and 32 ambulances.

The war has forced the shutdown of 27 out of 36 hospitals and 47 out of 72 primary health care clinics across Gaza, he said. The facilities stopping providing services mainly because of a lack of fuel and attacks, he said.

“Hospitals must be allowed to replenish the resources they need to continue functioning,” he said. “We cannot keep providing drops of aid in an ocean of needs.”

A WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION STAFF MEMBER AND HER FAMILY ARE KILLED IN STRIKE

CAIRO — The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering.

It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers.

The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike.

Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.”

Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives.

WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.""

POPE BEGS FOR PEACE AND AN END TO ‘TERRORISM’

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.”

In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives in Gaza.

Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath.

Francis said: “Here we’ve gone beyond war. This isn’t war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.”

ISRAEL PUBLISHES LIST OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS WHO COULD BE RELEASED UNDER HOSTAGE DEAL

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s Justice Ministry has published a list of 300 Palestinian detainees and prisoners who could potentially be released in a hostage deal.

Most of those on the list published Wednesday are teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses, including throwing rocks or alleged incitement. None was convicted of murder, though some served sentences for attempted murder.

The youngest detainee on the list is 14, and it also includes around 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

According to the truce-for-hostages deal announced Wednesday, 50 hostages will be released over four days, likely starting Thursday, during which fighting will pause.

After that, every additional 10 hostages released will result in one additional day in the pause and the release of additional Palestinian prisoners.

Israel is expected to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in the first four days, though the Ministry of Justice published the list of 300 in case the deal is extended. Under Israeli law, the public has 24 hours to object to any release.

CAIRO — The evacuation of patients trapped in Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has begun, the Palestinian Red Crescent says.

The charity said 14 ambulances arrived at the hospital on Wednesday, and the evacuation has been coordinated with the United Nations and Doctors without Borders medical group.

Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, has said there were over 250 patients at the facility, which was besieged by the Israeli military earlier this month. Over 400 displaced people sheltering in the facility have also been trapped there, he said.

Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital, the largest in Gaza, to conduct militant operations. Hamas and health officials have denied the allegation.

Over the weekend, the World Health Organization coordinated the evacuation of 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza. Of them, 28 babies were later transferred to Egypt.

EU OFFICIAL SAYS A HALT IN FIGHTING MUST BE USED TO FLOOD GAZA WITH AID

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s crisis management chief has welcomed the Israeli hostage release agreement and says the halt in fighting that is part of the deal must be used to flood Gaza with desperately needed aid.

“We hope that the agreement on a pause of hostilities that has just been reached will allow for a substantial surge in humanitarian aid delivery into and within Gaza,” Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic said Wednesday.

“We certainly hope that this will not be a one-off,” he told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, and called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses throughout Gaza.”

The 27-nation EU is the world’s biggest aid donor to the Palestinians. Lenarcic said 15 EU aid cargo flights have been sent, with most of that aid already in Gaza, and that more is on the way.

Lenarcic said getting into Gaza is “extremely challenging” and that fewer than 50 trucks a day make it through, a number which he described as “woefully inadequate.” He welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some fuel in, but said it only covers about one third of Gaza’s basic needs.

BRITAIN URGES BOTH SIDES TO ENSURE HOSTAGE AGREEMENT IS DELIVERED IN FULL

LONDON — The British government has welcomed an agreement to release some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza and urged all parties to ensure it is “delivered in full.”

Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the agreement was “a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

“This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis,” he said. “The U.K. will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.”

CHINA SAYS IT HOPES TRUCE AGREEMENT WILL EASE TENSIONS

A Foreign Ministry statement released Wednesday said Turkey expects full compliance with the agreement.

“We hope that the humanitarian pause will help permanently end the current conflict as soon as possible and initiate a process towards a just and lasting peace based on a two-state solution,” it said.

US STRIKES BACK AT IRAN-BACKED MILITANTS IN IRAQ

BAGHDAD — The United States military said Wednesday that it has carried out strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have launched attacks on U.S. forces.

CAIRO — The U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that almost 1,037,000 internally displaced Palestinians were currently seeking shelter in 156 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip.

In its report, the aid agency said that the number of its workers killed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza stands at 108. The information in the report was valid as of Tuesday.

Earlier Wednesday, UNRWA’s Secretary General, Philippe Lazzarini, gave a press conference in southern Gaza warning that the suffering of Palestinians will only worsen with the coming of winter, and that the besieged territory is on the verge of a waterborne disease outbreak.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a temporary truce was agreed between Israel and Hamas that will facilitate the release of dozens of people taken hostage during the militant group’s assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

The move has been welcomed by UNRWA whose leaders have continually called for a cease-fire.

NETANYAHU VOWS WAR WILL KEEP GOING AFTER CEASE-FIRE

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with Israel’s war against Hamas after a temporary cease-fire expires.

Netanyahu said he delivered the message to Biden in a phone call on Wednesday.

“I want to be clear. The war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals,” Netanyahu said.

A four-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is expected to take effect on Thursday.

Hamas can extend the truce by releasing more of the hostages it is holding.

But Netanyahu, along with the other members of his special war cabinet, told a press conference they will resume the war until Hamas is destroyed and all of the 240 hostages it is holding are released.

ISRAEL RELEASES AWARD-WINNING PALESTINIAN POET WHO WAS DETAINED BY TROOPS IN GAZA

JERUSALEM — The Israeli army says it has released an award-winning Palestinian poet it detained in Gaza.

Mosab Abu Toha has been contributing pieces to western media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire picture of its toll on civilians through his personal experience.

His family announced Monday that Abu Toha had been arrested while evacuating to southern Gaza from his home in the hard-hit Jabaliya refugee camp. Abu Toha last posted to X on Nov. 15, writing: “Alive. Thanks for your prayers.”

Diana Buttu, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and friend of the family, said Abu Toha was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint and held for two days with dozens of other Palestinians at an Israeli detention center. She says he was was accused of having Hamas connections and beaten up in custody. She said he was released on Tuesday, apparently after the case attracted international attention.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that Abu Toha had been released. It gave no further details.

Buttu said Abu Toha was safe in central Gaza after receiving medical treatment. The poet, whose son is an American citizen, is trying to leave the besieged territory.

MASS GRAVE FOR OVER 100 PALESTINIANS DUG IN SOUTHERN GAZA

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — More than 100 bodies were buried Wednesday in a mass grave in Khan Younis, the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheets fastened with cable ties.

Medical workers placed dozens of bodies brought from various areas in northern Gaza, including Shifa Hospital, into a huge trench that was dug using a bulldozer.

Workers wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the bodies to the grave and performed funeral prayers.

GENEVA — International aid groups that have lined up thousands of aid trucks for Gaza say they’re ready to move quickly to send in food, water and other supplies during an agreed, but yet undated, pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Details remain unclear about both the mechanics of getting more aid for beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza and the possible release of hostages kidnapped from Israel whose families have desperately sought their release.

“The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to the fine print of the announced deal.

Della Longa lamented bottlenecks that have confounded the scant deliveries of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He said IFRC hopes that a deal would include provisions to allow for a “faster track” of aid shipments.

The only route for international humanitarian aid into Gaza since Oct. 7 has been through the Rafah Crossing into Egypt, and planeloads of supplies have been flown into the nearby Egyptian city of El-Arish — and trucks have queued up near Gaza, where intense Israeli inspections of trucks and cargo have slowed entry.

IRANIAN-BACKED MILITANT GROUP VOWS TO EXPAND CONFLICT IF US AIRSTRIKES CONTINUE

WASHINGTON — A major Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq has warned it may strike additional U.S. targets after U.S. warplanes killed multiple militants in response to the first use of short-range ballistic missiles against U.S. forces at Al-Asad Air Base earlier this week.

U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and a Kataib Hezbollah command and control node south of Baghdad on Tuesday, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional sensitive details of the attacks.

There were Kataib Hezbollah personnel at both sites at the time of the strikes, but the officials said they could not yet confirm whether anyone there was killed.

Militia officials in Iraq said the attack had killed eight Kataib Hezbollah members.

Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday that it was considering “expanding the scope of targets” if the U.S. military continues with its strikes, adding that the attack “will not go unpunished.”

The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities on Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. The attacks have continued unabated since, with at least 66 rocket and missile attacks hitting U.S. facilities and wounding at least 62 service members.

Associated Press writers Tara Copp in Washington, D.C., and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed.

SWISS PARLIAMENT TO CONSIDER BAN ON HAMAS

GENEVA — Switzerland’s executive branch said Wednesday it will ask parliament to ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The Federal Council said the government will also end contracts it has with three Palestinian non-governmental organizations. They were among 11 Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that had been under review by Swiss officials following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.

Four days after the deadly rampage in Israel, the council moved to designate Hamas as a terrorist group and instructed the Foreign Ministry to consider a possible ban.

The seven-member council, which includes the Swiss president, reiterated its condemnation of the attacks “in the strongest possible terms” and expressed its regret about the deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict.

The United States and the European Union, which does not count Switzerland as a member, have long considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on the international community to provide “timely and sustained humanitarian assistance” to the Palestinians in Gaza.

Modi was speaking at a virtual meeting of Group of 20 nations on Wednesday before India's presidency ends on Nov. 30.

“We agree that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians anywhere is condemnable,"" Modi said. ""We welcome the news today concerning the release of the hostages. We hope that all the hostages will be released soon.”

Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war in Gaza — a breakthrough that will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and bring a large influx of aid to the besieged territory, officials said Wednesday.

“It is important to provide timely and sustained humanitarian assistance. It is also important to ensure that the war between Israel and Hamas does not take any regional form,” Modi said.

CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says the Israel-Hamas truce will take effect at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) Thursday.

Egypt helped mediate the four-day cease-fire, which will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The deal will also see the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israeli media also reported that the truce would begin Thursday at 10 a.m.

CAIRO — The World Health Organization has documented 178 attacks on healthcare facilities that killed 553 people, including 22 healthcare workers, since the war started on Oct. 7, the agency’s regional director said Wednesday.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari said in an online briefing that about 800 people, including 48 healthcare workers, were injured in the attacks, which damaged 24 hospitals and 32 ambulances.

The war has forced the shutdown of 27 out of 36 hospitals and 47 out of 72 primary health care clinics across Gaza, he said. The facilities stopping providing services mainly because of a lack of fuel and attacks, he said.

“Hospitals must be allowed to replenish the resources they need to continue functioning,” he said. “We cannot keep providing drops of aid in an ocean of needs.”

A WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION STAFF MEMBER AND HER FAMILY ARE KILLED IN STRIKE

CAIRO — The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering.

It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers.

The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike.

Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.”

Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives.

WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.""

POPE BEGS FOR PEACE AND AN END TO ‘TERRORISM’

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.”

In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives in Gaza.

Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath.

Francis said: “Here we’ve gone beyond war. This isn’t war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.”

ISRAEL PUBLISHES LIST OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS WHO COULD BE RELEASED UNDER HOSTAGE DEAL

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s Justice Ministry has published a list of 300 Palestinian detainees and prisoners who could potentially be released in a hostage deal.

Most of those on the list published Wednesday are teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses, including throwing rocks or alleged incitement. None was convicted of murder, though some served sentences for attempted murder.

The youngest detainee on the list is 14, and it also includes around 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

According to the truce-for-hostages deal announced Wednesday, 50 hostages will be released over four days, likely starting Thursday, during which fighting will pause.

After that, every additional 10 hostages released will result in one additional day in the pause and the release of additional Palestinian prisoners.

Israel is expected to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in the first four days, though the Ministry of Justice published the list of 300 in case the deal is extended. Under Israeli law, the public has 24 hours to object to any release.

CAIRO — The evacuation of patients trapped in Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has begun, the Palestinian Red Crescent says.

The charity said 14 ambulances arrived at the hospital on Wednesday, and the evacuation has been coordinated with the United Nations and Doctors without Borders medical group.

Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, has said there were over 250 patients at the facility, which was besieged by the Israeli military earlier this month. Over 400 displaced people sheltering in the facility have also been trapped there, he said.

Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital, the largest in Gaza, to conduct militant operations. Hamas and health officials have denied the allegation.

Over the weekend, the World Health Organization coordinated the evacuation of 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza. Of them, 28 babies were later transferred to Egypt.

EU OFFICIAL SAYS A HALT IN FIGHTING MUST BE USED TO FLOOD GAZA WITH AID

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s crisis management chief has welcomed the Israeli hostage release agreement and says the halt in fighting that is part of the deal must be used to flood Gaza with desperately needed aid.

“We hope that the agreement on a pause of hostilities that has just been reached will allow for a substantial surge in humanitarian aid delivery into and within Gaza,” Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic said Wednesday.

“We certainly hope that this will not be a one-off,” he told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, and called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses throughout Gaza.”

The 27-nation EU is the world’s biggest aid donor to the Palestinians. Lenarcic said 15 EU aid cargo flights have been sent, with most of that aid already in Gaza, and that more is on the way.

Lenarcic said getting into Gaza is “extremely challenging” and that fewer than 50 trucks a day make it through, a number which he described as “woefully inadequate.” He welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some fuel in, but said it only covers about one third of Gaza’s basic needs.

BRITAIN URGES BOTH SIDES TO ENSURE HOSTAGE AGREEMENT IS DELIVERED IN FULL

LONDON — The British government has welcomed an agreement to release some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza and urged all parties to ensure it is “delivered in full.”

Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the agreement was “a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

“This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis,” he said. “The U.K. will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.”

CHINA SAYS IT HOPES TRUCE AGREEMENT WILL EASE TENSIONS

BEIJING — The Chinese government says it welcomes the four-day truce reached between Israel and Hamas.

“We welcome the provisional truce reached by the parties concerned and hope it will help to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, de-escalate the conflict and ease tensions,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.

China has been calling for a cease-fire and refrained from criticizing the initial Hamas attack on Israel that started the latest conflict. A delegation of foreign ministers from Arab nations and Indonesia held talks with China’s foreign minister this week as they started a tour to press their case for a cease-fire with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.

RUSSIA SAYS TRUCE IS A STEP TOWARD ENDING HOSTILITIES

MOSCOW — The Kremlin on Wednesday hailed a deal between Israel and Hamas for a halt to the war and the release of hostages as step toward ending the hostilities.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the announcement of the deal was “the first good news from Gaza in a long time.”

Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he noted that Russia along with most other countries had called for a truce and humanitarian pauses, adding that “only on the basis of such pauses future attempts to find a lasting settlement to the problem could be made.”

FRANCE HOPEFUL ITS NATIONALS WILL BE AMONG THE FIRST RELEASED UNDER DEAL

PARIS — France’s foreign minister says she’s hopeful that French nationals will be among the first hostages released as part of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas.

“We hope that French nationals are among them and even, if possible, among the first group that will be released,” the minister, Catherine Colonna, said Wednesday on France Inter radio. “We are working for that.”

France counts eight people missing, some of them confirmed as hostages, from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants that ignited their latest and deadliest war. France also counts 40 killed in the attack. Colonna said that not all the hostages taken on Oct. 7 were captured by Hamas. But she said that in the course of negotiations, the militant group has said that “it could assemble together all of the hostages.”

In a message on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said “we are working tirelessly to ensure that all hostages are released.” He also hoped the truce will “enable aid to be brought in” and help the Gaza people.

TURKEY SAYS IT HOPES TRUCE WILL LEAD TO A LASTING PEACE

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey, a vocal critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza, welcomed the four-day truce as a “positive development to prevent more bloodshed.”

A Foreign Ministry statement released Wednesday said Turkey expects full compliance with the agreement.

“We hope that the humanitarian pause will help permanently end the current conflict as soon as possible and initiate a process towards a just and lasting peace based on a two-state solution,” it said.

US STRIKES BACK AT IRAN-BACKED MILITANTS IN IRAQ

BAGHDAD — The United States military said Wednesday that it has carried out strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have launched attacks on U.S. forces.

The U.S. Central Command said in a statement Wednesday that its forces had “conducted discrete, precision strikes against two facilities in Iraq … in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups,” including one on Tuesday involving the use of close-range ballistic missiles.

Two officials with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said the strikes hit three locations in the area of Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad, killing eight members of the Kataeb Hezbollah militant group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Iranian-backed militants have launched dozens of attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. While most of the more than five dozen attacks have been ineffective, at least 60 U.S. personnel have reported minor injuries. The militant groups have said the strikes are in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

ROME — Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted a town hall meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday, booing and heckling him when he addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The protesters chanted “Shame on you” and accused Kristersson of supporting genocide after he said Sweden condemns Hamas and supports Israel’s right to self-defense. Police removed some of them from the venue in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second biggest city.

Kristersson criticized the protesters in a Facebook post after the event.

“When we met tonight with a few hundred Gothenburgers the meeting was disrupted by a screaming and shouting group of people who refused to respect everyone else who had come to ask questions,” he wrote. “These political saboteurs appeared to have come to our question-and-answer session only to shout out their anger over Sweden and the EU’s political position about the conflict in the Middle East -– they were particularly disappointed over the condemnation of the terror organization Hamas.”

Kristersson’s center-right government has strongly sided with Israel in the Gaza conflict, condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and supporting Israel’s right to self-defense. Pro-Palestinian groups and the left-leaning opposition have accused the government of ignoring the plight of Palestinian civilians."
1141866240,20231122,"On November 7, Kazakhstan’s government approved a national accessible internet project that includes testing the use of currently-banned SpaceX Starlink technology in 10 rural schools.

Kazakhstan is moving to introduce 5G technology across the country, but the government first wants to study how the privately-owned Starlink system would be used in Kazakhstan.

The Telecommunications Committee of Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation, and Aerospace Industry on November 17 warned citizens that, for now, it is still illegal to use Starlink.

Starlink is a series of thousands of small satellites, launched into orbit by SpaceX, that can provide high-speed Internet access to most parts of the world.

The Director of the Ministry’s Telecommunications Committee Dias Tolegenov said use of the “current version” of Starlink “violates current (Kazakh) legislation, as it does not meet safety requirements.”

Tolegenov was responding to comments from journalists that many people in Kazakhstan were purchasing and installing Starlink on their computers for personal use.

Tolegenov said until technical studies on Starlink use at these schools are complete and new legislation is approved, “it will be illegal” for Kazakh citizens to use the system.

Those selling or using the system could face a fine of 34,500 tenge (some $75).

Tolegenov assured the wait would not be long and after amendments were passed regarding use of the system “Kazakhstanis will be able to legally use terminals.”

Why It’s Important: The Kazakh government is already preparing the project’s next step, to expand access to Starlink to 2,000 rural schools. This project was agreed between Minister of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry Bagdat Musin and SpaceX executive Lauren Dreyer on October 12.

It is part of 2024-2027 state program that will cost some 1.5 trillion tenge (about $3.2 billion) to provide nationwide broadband Internet access at a speed of at least 100 megabits per second.

Tolegenov did not detail what the study of Starlink will entail, but almost certainly it will involve the state’s ability to block prohibited websites and interrupt service during a national crisis.

During the unrest in Kazakhstan in January 2022 that left at least 238 people dead, authorities cut Internet access in the country when violence broke out.

Kazakh authorities see the necessity of having reliable high-speed internet access that reaches even the most remote parts of the country – but they do not want it used to foment unrest.

EU Anti-Drug Program Warns of Increase of Afghan Methamphetamines in Uzbekistan

The head of the European Union’s Central Asia Drug Action Program (CADAP) warned that Uzbekistan is likely to see a rise in the amount of methamphetamines coming from neighboring Afghanistan.

CADAP director Ernest Robello said at a November 15 event in Uzbekistan that opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan was down by 95 percent since April 2022.

Robello added that while there has been a decline in opium-based drugs coming out of Afghanistan, there has been a surge in other drugs coming from Afghanistan, notably methamphetamines.

In May, Uzbek border guards stopped a truck entering the country from Afghanistan that was hauling 18 metric tons of pomegranate juice in plastic bottles purchased by an Uzbek company.

Several of the boxes were marked with the letter “M” and border guards said the color of the liquid inside 48 bottles in those boxes differed from the rest of the shipment.

The juice in those bottles tested positive for containing methamphetamines.

Uzbek counter-narcotics officials determined the intended recipients planned to evaporate the juice in a laboratory and collect the remaining methamphetamine for sale.

Uzbek border guards estimated the value of the seized methamphetamines to be tens of millions of dollars.

The border guards also reported seizing more than 240 pounds of synthetic drugs in 2022, and 227 pounds during the first four months of 2023.

Why It’s Important: The UN Office on Drugs and Crime said in early September that Afghanistan is quickly becoming one the world’s leading producers of methamphetamines.

The data on confiscated drugs provided by Uzbek border guards already show a sharp increase in methamphetamine trafficking into Uzbekistan.

The situation is likely worse with the other Central Asian states neighboring Afghanistan that have much longer borders.

Uzbekistan’s border with Afghanistan is only about 100 miles long.

Turkmenistan’s border with Afghanistan is some 460 miles long and much of it is sparsely inhabited desert, and the border with Tajikistan is about 843 miles long, most of it running through remote and sparsely inhabited mountains.

Neither of those two Central Asian countries have commented on drug seizures involving synthetic drugs.

The Central Asian states have been on trafficking routes for Afghan opium and heroin headed toward Russia and Europe for more than three decades.

Now Central Asia can expect to be part of new Afghan amphetamine trafficking routes to pass through the region, targeting world markets.

This week’s Majlis podcast looks at gender violence in Kazakhstan after three shocking cases there dominated the news in November.

In one case, police pressured a rape victim to drop her case. In another case, the rapist was the police chief.

The cases, and that of a woman beaten to death by her prominent husband, have sparked new calls for greater protection for women.

A natural gas distribution system at Almaty’s Thermal Power Plant Two (TPP-2) was just put into operation, as part of a project to convert the coal-burning power plant to use cleaner-burning natural gas.

Air pollution from coal-fired TPPs in big cities across Central Asia has been reaching dangerous levels for health.

Governments in the region have been promising to transition their thermal power plants from using coal to natural gas, but nearly all these projects have yet to be realized.

Almaty Deputy Mayor Askar Amrin said changing from coal to gas at (TPP-2) will cut pollutant emissions from the current 37,000 metric tons annually to 3,000 metric tons.

TPP-2 is the largest TPP in Almaty Province and provides Almaty city with 60 percent of its heat and 40 percent of the city’s electricity.

On November 17, Turkmen authorities prevented veteran Turkmen journalist Soltan Achilova, 74, from boarding a flight to Geneva to receive a prestigious international award.

Achilova is a photojournalist who has reported on social problems and government violations of human rights in Turkmenistan.

She was going to Geneva to accept the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders and speak at several public events.

Customs officials at the Ashgabat airport declared the passports of Achilova, and her daughter Maya who was accompanying Achilova to Geneva, were invalid.

Human Rights Watch Deputy Director for Europe and Central Asia Rachel Denber posted on X (formerly Twitter) about Achilova’s situation: “(T)he Turkmen gov is doing more damage to its reputation than anything Achilova could have possibly said while abroad,” Denber wrote.

“Tajikistan ranks among the top 12 exporters of dried apricots worldwide. Approximately 10% of the global production of apricots is concentrated in (Tajikistan’s northern) Sughd province.”

• The EU delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS said the Erasmus+ Postgraduate Scholarship Programme is ready to welcome students
• About 800 Nigerians have been awarded scholarships via the programme since 2014

Pascal Oparada has over a decade of experience covering Tech, Energy, Stocks, Investments, and Economy.

The European Union delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS has announced the beginning of the application phase for the Erasmus+ Postgraduate Scholarship Programme for 2024.

The programme allows Nigerians to pursue Masters and Ph.D. degree programmes in European countries fully funded and paid for by the EU.

EU highlights the importance of the scholarship

The EU Ambassador to Nigeria ECOWAS, Samuels Isopi, highlighted the importance of the initiative.

He said the scholarship programme offers an opportunity for Nigerians seeking to advance their academic goals in Europe.

BusinessDay reports that this year's programme includes teaching and non-teaching staff of higher education institutions, enabling knowledge-sharing, and professional enhancements.

Interested candidates have been asked to visit the website of the Erasmus+ Scholarship for details on application procedures, eligibility criteria, and fields of study.

The ambassador stressed the EU’s commitment to skills development in partnership with Nigeria, stating that the initiative nurtures and strengthens the bonds between Nigeria and the EU via the power of education.

Since 2014, the EU has awarded over 800 young Nigerians postgraduate scholarships.

Legit.ng reported earlier that Germany is actively looking to attract foreign talent from Nigeria and other countries amid a significant labour shortage.

According to a report, there are over 1.98 million job vacancies across various sectors, and there is an intense desire by the government to fill the gap.

The job shortage is attributed to an ageing population, a low birth rate, and an escalating demand for skilled professionals.

The openings are in crucial sectors such as farming, construction, and transportation, creating a unique window of opportunity for foreign workers seeking employment in the country."

Tzachi Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

The cease-fire agreement between the Hamas militant group and Israel had earlier been confirmed by both parties, along with Washington and Qatar, which helped broker the deal that would bring a temporary halt to the devastating war that is now in its seventh week.

The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas will free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages taken in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel will release some Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Egyptian state media say the truce will begin Thursday morning. Egypt helped mediate the cease-fire agreement, which would bring the first respite to war-weary Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Wednesday he told U.S. President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with the war after a cease-fire expires. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas.

US DESTROYER SHOOTS DOWN BOMB-CARRYING DRONES LAUNCHED FROM HOUTHI-CONTROLLED TERRITORY

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United States military says one of its warships in the Red Sea has shot down bomb-carrying drones launched from territory controlled by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.

The military arm of Yemen’s Houthi rebels said earlier Wednesday that it launched a batch of long-range large missiles toward southern Israel, including the Red Sea city of Eilat. The Iran-backed rebel group has launched at least six aerial attacks against Israel since the conflict broke out on Oct. 7.

The Houthi are staunch foes of Israel and have vowed to continue aerial attacks and hijackings of Israeli ships.

The American military’s Central Command said the USS Thomas Hudner, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, shot down the drones early Thursday morning.

“The ship and crew sustained no damage or injury,” Central Command said, but did not identify what it believed the drones were targeting.

ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE IN SOUTH LEBANON BELIEVED TO HAVE KILLED SON OF HEAD OF HEZBOLLAH'S PARLIAMENTARY BLOC

BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon late Wednesday is believed to have killed the son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc in Lebanon, Mohammed Raad. Hezbollah announced early Thursday that five of its fighters were killed, among them Abbas Mohammed Raad, identified by local media as the son of the legislator.

The Lebanese militant group has a political wing that has long held seats in the country’s parliament.

The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli airstrike on a house in the town of Beit Yahoun late Wednesday killed four people and wounded one. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike.

On Wednesday, Hamas announced that Khalil Kharraz, a commander of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon, was killed in an Israeli airstrike the day before. Also on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike killed two journalists from the pan-Arab TV channel Al Mayadeen as they were reporting in south Lebanon. The Israeli military has said it is looking into the incident.

The Lebanon-Israel border has seen daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. While mostly limited to the border area, the clashes have stirred fears of a wider regional war.

ISRAEL SAYS CEASE-FIRE TALKS ARE ONGOING AND HOSTAGE RELEASE WON'T HAPPEN BEFORE FRIDAY

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser says a planned hostage-for-prisoner swap with Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.

In a statement released late Wednesday, Tzachi Hanegbi said that contacts on the deal were continuing. “The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday,” he said.

The swap is to take place as part of a four-day truce expected to begin on Thursday.

Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

NETANYAHU SAYS SPY AGENCY WILL ACT AGAINSt HAMAS LEADERS OVERSEAS

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has instructed the country's Mossad spy agency to track down the leadership of the Hamas militant group living in other countries outside Gaza.

“I have instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas, wherever they are,” Netanyahu told a news conference.

Most of Hamas’ top leadership lives in exile, primarily in the Gulf state of Qatar and the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The Mossad has been accused in a series of assassinations overseas of Palestinian militants and Iranian nuclear scientists over the years.

OVER A MILLION DISPLACED IN GAZA ARE SHELTERING IN UN FACILITIES

CAIRO — The U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that almost 1,037,000 internally displaced Palestinians were currently seeking shelter in 156 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip.

In its report, the aid agency said that the number of its workers killed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza stands at 108. The information in the report was valid as of Tuesday.

Earlier Wednesday, UNRWA’s Secretary General, Philippe Lazzarini, gave a press conference in southern Gaza warning that the suffering of Palestinians will only worsen with the coming of winter, and that the besieged territory is on the verge of a waterborne disease outbreak.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a temporary truce was agreed between Israel and Hamas that will facilitate the release of dozens of people taken hostage during the militant group’s assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

The move has been welcomed by UNRWA whose leaders have continually called for a cease-fire.

NETANYAHU VOWS WAR WILL KEEP GOING AFTER CEASE-FIRE

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with Israel’s war against Hamas after a temporary cease-fire expires.

Netanyahu said he delivered the message to Biden in a phone call on Wednesday.

“I want to be clear. The war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals,” Netanyahu said.

A four-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is expected to take effect on Thursday.

Hamas can extend the truce by releasing more of the hostages it is holding.

But Netanyahu, along with the other members of his special war cabinet, told a press conference they will resume the war until Hamas is destroyed and all of the 240 hostages it is holding are released.

ISRAEL RELEASES AWARD-WINNING PALESTINIAN POET WHO WAS DETAINED BY TROOPS IN GAZA

JERUSALEM — The Israeli army says it has released an award-winning Palestinian poet it detained in Gaza.

Mosab Abu Toha has been contributing pieces to western media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire picture of its toll on civilians through his personal experience.

His family announced Monday that Abu Toha had been arrested while evacuating to southern Gaza from his home in the hard-hit Jabaliya refugee camp. Abu Toha last posted to X on Nov. 15, writing: “Alive. Thanks for your prayers.”

Diana Buttu, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and friend of the family, said Abu Toha was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint and held for two days with dozens of other Palestinians at an Israeli detention center. She says he was was accused of having Hamas connections and beaten up in custody. She said he was released on Tuesday, apparently after the case attracted international attention.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that Abu Toha had been released. It gave no further details.

Buttu said Abu Toha was safe in central Gaza after receiving medical treatment. The poet, whose son is an American citizen, is trying to leave the besieged territory.

MASS GRAVE FOR OVER 100 PALESTINIANS DUG IN SOUTHERN GAZA

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — More than 100 bodies were buried Wednesday in a mass grave in Khan Younis, the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheets fastened with cable ties.

Medical workers placed dozens of bodies brought from various areas in northern Gaza, including Shifa Hospital, into a huge trench that was dug using a bulldozer.

Workers wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the bodies to the grave and performed funeral prayers.

GENEVA — International aid groups that have lined up thousands of aid trucks for Gaza say they’re ready to move quickly to send in food, water and other supplies during an agreed, but yet undated, pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Details remain unclear about both the mechanics of getting more aid for beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza and the possible release of hostages kidnapped from Israel whose families have desperately sought their release.

“The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to the fine print of the announced deal.

Della Longa lamented bottlenecks that have confounded the scant deliveries of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He said IFRC hopes that a deal would include provisions to allow for a “faster track” of aid shipments.

The only route for international humanitarian aid into Gaza since Oct. 7 has been through the Rafah Crossing into Egypt, and planeloads of supplies have been flown into the nearby Egyptian city of El-Arish — and trucks have queued up near Gaza, where intense Israeli inspections of trucks and cargo have slowed entry.

IRANIAN-BACKED MILITANT GROUP VOWS TO EXPAND CONFLICT IF US AIRSTRIKES CONTINUE

WASHINGTON — A major Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq has warned it may strike additional U.S. targets after U.S. warplanes killed multiple militants in response to the first use of short-range ballistic missiles against U.S. forces at Al-Asad Air Base earlier this week.

U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and a Kataib Hezbollah command and control node south of Baghdad on Tuesday, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional sensitive details of the attacks.

There were Kataib Hezbollah personnel at both sites at the time of the strikes, but the officials said they could not yet confirm whether anyone there was killed.

Militia officials in Iraq said the attack had killed eight Kataib Hezbollah members.

Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday that it was considering “expanding the scope of targets” if the U.S. military continues with its strikes, adding that the attack “will not go unpunished.”

The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities on Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. The attacks have continued unabated since, with at least 66 rocket and missile attacks hitting U.S. facilities and wounding at least 62 service members.

Associated Press writers Tara Copp in Washington, D.C., and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed.

SWISS PARLIAMENT TO CONSIDER BAN ON HAMAS

GENEVA — Switzerland’s executive branch said Wednesday it will ask parliament to ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The Federal Council said the government will also end contracts it has with three Palestinian non-governmental organizations. They were among 11 Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that had been under review by Swiss officials following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.

Four days after the deadly rampage in Israel, the council moved to designate Hamas as a terrorist group and instructed the Foreign Ministry to consider a possible ban.

The seven-member council, which includes the Swiss president, reiterated its condemnation of the attacks “in the strongest possible terms” and expressed its regret about the deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict.

The United States and the European Union, which does not count Switzerland as a member, have long considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on the international community to provide “timely and sustained humanitarian assistance” to the Palestinians in Gaza.

Modi was speaking at a virtual meeting of Group of 20 nations on Wednesday before India’s presidency ends on Nov. 30.

“We agree that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians anywhere is condemnable,"" Modi said. ""We welcome the news today concerning the release of the hostages. We hope that all the hostages will be released soon.”

Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war in Gaza — a breakthrough that will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and bring a large influx of aid to the besieged territory, officials said Wednesday.

“It is important to provide timely and sustained humanitarian assistance. It is also important to ensure that the war between Israel and Hamas does not take any regional form,” Modi said.

CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says the Israel-Hamas truce will take effect at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) Thursday.

Egypt helped mediate the four-day cease-fire, which will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The deal will also see the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israeli media also reported that the truce would begin Thursday at 10 a.m.

CAIRO — The World Health Organization has documented 178 attacks on healthcare facilities that killed 553 people, including 22 healthcare workers, since the war started on Oct. 7, the agency’s regional director said Wednesday.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari said in an online briefing that about 800 people, including 48 healthcare workers, were injured in the attacks, which damaged 24 hospitals and 32 ambulances.

The war has forced the shutdown of 27 out of 36 hospitals and 47 out of 72 primary health care clinics across Gaza, he said. The facilities stopping providing services mainly because of a lack of fuel and attacks, he said.

“Hospitals must be allowed to replenish the resources they need to continue functioning,” he said. “We cannot keep providing drops of aid in an ocean of needs.”

A WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION STAFF MEMBER AND HER FAMILY ARE KILLED IN STRIKE

CAIRO — The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering.

It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers.

The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike.

Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.”

Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives.

WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.""

POPE BEGS FOR PEACE AND AN END TO ‘TERRORISM’

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.”

In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives in Gaza.

Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath.

Francis said: “Here we’ve gone beyond war. This isn’t war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.”

ISRAEL PUBLISHES LIST OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS WHO COULD BE RELEASED UNDER HOSTAGE DEAL

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s Justice Ministry has published a list of 300 Palestinian detainees and prisoners who could potentially be released in a hostage deal.

Most of those on the list published Wednesday are teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses, including throwing rocks or alleged incitement. None was convicted of murder, though some served sentences for attempted murder.

The youngest detainee on the list is 14, and it also includes around 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

According to the truce-for-hostages deal announced Wednesday, 50 hostages will be released over four days, likely starting Thursday, during which fighting will pause.

After that, every additional 10 hostages released will result in one additional day in the pause and the release of additional Palestinian prisoners.

Israel is expected to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in the first four days, though the Ministry of Justice published the list of 300 in case the deal is extended. Under Israeli law, the public has 24 hours to object to any release.

CAIRO — The evacuation of patients trapped in Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has begun, the Palestinian Red Crescent says.

The charity said 14 ambulances arrived at the hospital on Wednesday, and the evacuation has been coordinated with the United Nations and Doctors without Borders medical group.

Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, has said there were over 250 patients at the facility, which was besieged by the Israeli military earlier this month. Over 400 displaced people sheltering in the facility have also been trapped there, he said.

Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital, the largest in Gaza, to conduct militant operations. Hamas and health officials have denied the allegation.

Over the weekend, the World Health Organization coordinated the evacuation of 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza. Of them, 28 babies were later transferred to Egypt.

EU OFFICIAL SAYS A HALT IN FIGHTING MUST BE USED TO FLOOD GAZA WITH AID

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s crisis management chief has welcomed the Israeli hostage release agreement and says the halt in fighting that is part of the deal must be used to flood Gaza with desperately needed aid.

“We hope that the agreement on a pause of hostilities that has just been reached will allow for a substantial surge in humanitarian aid delivery into and within Gaza,” Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic said Wednesday.

“We certainly hope that this will not be a one-off,” he told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, and called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses throughout Gaza.”

The 27-nation EU is the world’s biggest aid donor to the Palestinians. Lenarcic said 15 EU aid cargo flights have been sent, with most of that aid already in Gaza, and that more is on the way.

Lenarcic said getting into Gaza is “extremely challenging” and that fewer than 50 trucks a day make it through, a number which he described as “woefully inadequate.” He welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some fuel in, but said it only covers about one third of Gaza’s basic needs.

BRITAIN URGES BOTH SIDES TO ENSURE HOSTAGE AGREEMENT IS DELIVERED IN FULL

LONDON — The British government has welcomed an agreement to release some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza and urged all parties to ensure it is “delivered in full.”

Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the agreement was “a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

“This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis,” he said. “The U.K. will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.”

CHINA SAYS IT HOPES TRUCE AGREEMENT WILL EASE TENSIONS

BEIJING — The Chinese government says it welcomes the four-day truce reached between Israel and Hamas.

“We welcome the provisional truce reached by the parties concerned and hope it will help to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, de-escalate the conflict and ease tensions,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.

China has been calling for a cease-fire and refrained from criticizing the initial Hamas attack on Israel that started the latest conflict. A delegation of foreign ministers from Arab nations and Indonesia held talks with China’s foreign minister this week as they started a tour to press their case for a cease-fire with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.

RUSSIA SAYS TRUCE IS A STEP TOWARD ENDING HOSTILITIES

MOSCOW — The Kremlin on Wednesday hailed a deal between Israel and Hamas for a halt to the war and the release of hostages as step toward ending the hostilities.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the announcement of the deal was “the first good news from Gaza in a long time.”

Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he noted that Russia along with most other countries had called for a truce and humanitarian pauses, adding that “only on the basis of such pauses future attempts to find a lasting settlement to the problem could be made.”

FRANCE HOPEFUL ITS NATIONALS WILL BE AMONG THE FIRST RELEASED UNDER DEAL

PARIS — France’s foreign minister says she’s hopeful that French nationals will be among the first hostages released as part of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas.

“We hope that French nationals are among them and even, if possible, among the first group that will be released,” the minister, Catherine Colonna, said Wednesday on France Inter radio. “We are working for that.”

France counts eight people missing, some of them confirmed as hostages, from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants that ignited their latest and deadliest war. France also counts 40 killed in the attack. Colonna said that not all the hostages taken on Oct. 7 were captured by Hamas. But she said that in the course of negotiations, the militant group has said that “it could assemble together all of the hostages.”

In a message on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said “we are working tirelessly to ensure that all hostages are released.” He also hoped the truce will “enable aid to be brought in” and help the Gaza people.

TURKEY SAYS IT HOPES TRUCE WILL LEAD TO A LASTING PEACE

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey, a vocal critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza, welcomed the four-day truce as a “positive development to prevent more bloodshed.”

A Foreign Ministry statement released Wednesday said Turkey expects full compliance with the agreement.

“We hope that the humanitarian pause will help permanently end the current conflict as soon as possible and initiate a process towards a just and lasting peace based on a two-state solution,” it said.

US STRIKES BACK AT IRAN-BACKED MILITANTS IN IRAQ

BAGHDAD — The United States military said Wednesday that it has carried out strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have launched attacks on U.S. forces.

The U.S. Central Command said in a statement Wednesday that its forces had “conducted discrete, precision strikes against two facilities in Iraq … in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups,” including one on Tuesday involving the use of close-range ballistic missiles.

Two officials with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said the strikes hit three locations in the area of Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad, killing eight members of the Kataeb Hezbollah militant group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Iranian-backed militants have launched dozens of attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. While most of the more than five dozen attacks have been ineffective, at least 60 U.S. personnel have reported minor injuries. The militant groups have said the strikes are in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

ROME — Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted a town hall meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday, booing and heckling him when he addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The protesters chanted “Shame on you” and accused Kristersson of supporting genocide after he said Sweden condemns Hamas and supports Israel’s right to self-defense. Police removed some of them from the venue in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second biggest city.

Kristersson criticized the protesters in a Facebook post after the event.

“When we met tonight with a few hundred Gothenburgers the meeting was disrupted by a screaming and shouting group of people who refused to respect everyone else who had come to ask questions,” he wrote. “These political saboteurs appeared to have come to our question-and-answer session only to shout out their anger over Sweden and the EU’s political position about the conflict in the Middle East -– they were particularly disappointed over the condemnation of the terror organization Hamas.”

Kristersson’s center-right government has strongly sided with Israel in the Gaza conflict, condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and supporting Israel’s right to self-defense. Pro-Palestinian groups and the left-leaning opposition have accused the government of ignoring the plight of Palestinian civilians."
1141883249,20231122,"SKOPJE – Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama urged NATO on Wednesday to further boost its military forces in Kosovo and secure the country's borders with Serbia, warning that recent ethnic violence in Kosovo could potentially trigger a wider Balkan conflict.

Kosovo’s border with Serbia was “out of control,"" Rama said after an informal meeting of Western Balkan NATO members in North Macedonia.

He said the frontier was being used for a host of illegal activities, including drugs and arms smuggling and infiltration by ultra nationalists, that could lead to “great disturbances” in the region.

Kosovo, which has an ethnic Albanian majority, is a former Serbian province. It gained independence with the help of a NATO military campaign, launched in 1999 to end a bloody Serb crackdown on an armed separatist movement.

Tensions remain high, with violence breaking out twice in recent months, and Western countries fear that Russia could try to foment trouble in the Balkans to avert attention from the war in Ukraine.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the meeting in North Macedonia's capital, Skopje, insisted after Wednesday's talks that NATO doesn't see any military threat to its allies in the Western Balkans.

“But what we do see is an increase in tensions, especially in Kosovo,” Stoltenberg said.

He said that NATO has strengthened its military presence in Kosovo — established after the 1999 bombing campaign against Serbia — with about 1,000 additional troops and heavier weaponry.

“We are cautious, of course. We are closely monitoring the situation and we will certainly do what is necessary to protect and defend our allies,” Stoltenberg said.

During a visit to Kosovo on Monday, Stoltenberg said that NATO was considering deploying additional peacekeeping troops there. On Tuesday in Belgrade, he said that the recent violent outbreaks in Kosovo were unacceptable and perpetrators must be brought to justice.

In May, Serb demonstrators in northern Kosovo clashed with NATO peacekeeping troops. In September, a Kosovo police officer and three Serb gunmen were killed in a shootout after about 30 masked men opened fire on a police patrol near the Kosovo village of Banjska.

Serbia doesn't recognize Kosovo's formal declaration of independence in 2008. Both countries want to join the European Union, which is mediating a dialogue between the former foes. Brussels has warned both that refusal to compromise jeopardizes their chances of joining the bloc.

Wednesday's talks in Skopje were attended by Rama, the prime ministers of North Macedonia and Montenegro, Dimitar Kovačevski and Milojko Spajić, as well as Croatian President Zoran Milanović."
1141875857,20231122,"After the UK voted to leave the European Union and the government negotiated for British travellers to become “third-country nationals subject to a range of restrictions, British passport holders must now have their travel documents inspected and stamped.

The next steps, which are likely to be introduced in autumn 2024, will involve more red tape. The good news: passport stamping will end. The bad news: every traveller must be fingerprinted and provide a facial biometric.

The European Union is planning to introduce an “Entry/Exit System” (EES) that will record the movements of non-EU visitors. Shortly afterwards – in mid 2025, according the latest plan – prospective UK visitors to the Schengen area will have to apply online for permission to enter.

The Schengen area comprises most of the 27 remaining members of the European Union (but not Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland or Romania), plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

The Electronic Travel Information and Authorisation System (Etias) is the next step in tightening frontier controls. It depends upon EES being fully functional and is due to appear in mid-2025.

When it is introduced, the €7 (£6) online permit will be valid for three years.

What is the “Entry/Exit System”?

The Entry/Exit System is an automated IT system for registering citizens from “third countries”, which means everywhere outside the EU and Schengen area.

The system is aimed at such travellers when they either enter or leave at an external Schengen border – such as flying from the UK to Spain or crossing by road from Greece to Turkey. (It will not be used for internal frontiers within the Schengen area.)

EES will register the date and place of entry or exit, plus fingerprints and a facial biometric.

This system, says the European Union, “will replace the current system of manual stamping of passports, which is time-consuming, does not provide reliable data on border crossings, and does not allow a systematic detection of over-stayers”.

British travellers, like other “third-country nationals,” are restricted to 90 days’ stay in any 180 days within the Schengen area. But enforcement of this currently depends on checking passport stamps and is applied haphazardly.

When will it start?

Originally EES was due to start in 2021. But the body responsible for implementation – the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (EU-LISA) – has repeatedly pushed back the date because the database is far from ready.

In October 2023, the European Council’s Justice and Home Affairs Council endorsed a new timeline for the roll-out of EES,.

The council said in a statement: “The new roadmap for the delivery of the new IT architecture foresees that the Entry/Exit System will be ready to enter into operation in autumn 2024.”

How will the biometric checks work?

Outbound and inbound passengers will go through the formalities at airports abroad, in a similar way to US immigration, though both on the way in and out of the Schengen area.

Some EU members have expressed alarm at the extra time involved in the new processes, with the Slovenian government warning: “It takes up to four times longer to do the new process.”

For terrestrial travellers it could be even worse.

Giving evidence to Parliament about the new system, Tim Reardon, head of EU exit for the Port of Dover, said: “There is no such thing as an e-gate for a car, and there is no such thing as an e-gate process for people travelling as a group. They’re all one-at-a-time processes.

“There is no way of doing a biometric control without getting everyone out of the vehicle.

“That’s the one thing on our site which cannot happen, because you’re in the middle of live traffic. It would be equivalent to asking people to get out of their car at a motorway toll booth. It’s fundamentally unsafe and it can’t happen.”

Gareth Williams, strategy director for Eurostar, which runs trains to France from London, said: “We don’t currently see a practical solution. If we take the peak of August, up to 80 per cent of people will have to go through the system.

“We do have a very extreme space challenge. At a minimum we would require over 30 kiosks, and an area about the size of our entire check-in area at St Pancras.”

The rules will not apply to EU citizens.

The much-delayed scheme is now anticipated to start in mid-2025. A “grace period” of six months is likely to be granted, meaning it is likely Etias will not become mandatory before 2026.

Officially, no. Europe says that Etias is “a pre-travel authorisation system”. It is a similar concept to the US Esta, the Canadian eTA and the British ETA, which are not technically visas. They are issued to international travellers who do not require a full visa.

“Its key function is to verify if a third-country national meets entry requirements before travelling to the Schengen area,” says the EU.

But as Etias requires visitors to apply in advance, provide lots of personal information, pay money and be issued with a permit to cross a border, it is not surprising that it is commonly termed a “eurovisa”.

How much does it cost?

The fee is €7 (£6) for all applicants aged 18 to 70; while those under 18 or over 70 will still need an Etias, it will be free.

When finally the EU is ready, at the heart of the system is an Etias app and website. Travellers will be required to submit personal information including name, address, contact details in Europe and passport data. They must also state an occupation (with job title and employer). Students will be required to give the name of their educational establishment).

The applicant must give details of any serious convictions in the past 20 years.

Travellers must also provide online the reason for their journey (holiday, business, visiting family, etc), specify the country they will first arrive in, and provide the address of their first night’s stay – which will pose a problem for tourists who like to make plans as they go along.

As with other online travel permits, commercial intermediaries are allowed – but according to Frontex, the EU organisation implementing Etias, there are many scam sites out there that are likely to apply fees way above the basic €7 (£6).

Any site other than europa.eu/etias is unofficial and should not be trusted.

One “imposter” site claims to have processed 671 applications already; this is impossible since no applications have been processed anywhere.

Another site offers a 40 per cent discount for early applications. Some use the EU logo, which is illegal.

Frontex also warns about the risk of identity theft if personal information is provided to imposter sites.

What happens to the information?

Every application will be checked against EU and relevant Interpol databases, as well as “a dedicated Etias watch-list”.

The system will be tuned to pick out individuals suspected of being involved in terrorism, armed robbery, child pornography, fraud, money laundering, cybercrime, people smuggling, trafficking in endangered animal species, counterfeiting and industrial espionage.

How far in advance must I apply?

The European Union says: “We strongly advise you to obtain the Etias travel authorisation before you buy your tickets and book your hotels.”

The aim is for an Etias to be granted within minutes, though even a straightforward application could take up to four days.

If an application is flagged (ie there is a “hit” with one of the databases) the applicant may be asked to provide additional information. Alternatively, says the EU, the applicant may be asked “to participate in an interview with national authorities, which may take up to additional 30 days”.

Assuming yours is granted, there is no certificate issued, and nothing needs to be printed. The frontier guard will get the information he or she needs from the passport you used to apply.

In a case of mistaken identity, will I be able to appeal?

Yes. Details of how to appeal will be included with the notice of rejection.

Once I have an Etias, am I guaranteed admission to the Schengen area?

No. “Mere possession of a travel authorisation does not confer an automatic right of entry,” says the EU. As with the US, travellers can be turned away for any reason.

There is likely to be a mechanism in place for an Etias to be rescinded.

Do I need to apply for an Etias every time I travel to Europe?

No. The permit will be valid for three years, or until your passport runs out, whichever is the earlier.

Will I need an Etias to travel to Ireland?

No. The Common Travel Area incorporating the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands transcends European Union rules, and in any event, Ireland is not in the Schengen area.

If I have a long-stay permit from one of the EU nations, must I obtain an Etias?

How are people without internet access supposed to apply?

They will be expected to get a friend, a family member or a travel agent to make the application for them, in the same way as the US Esta and similar schemes.

Just remind us about the 90/180 day rule?

This rule, to which the UK asked to be subject after leaving the European Union, means that British travellers cannot stay more than 90 days in any stretch of 180 days.

As an example of what it means: if you were to spend the first 90 days of 2024 (January, February and almost all of March) in the Schengen area, you would not be able to return until late June.

Is this all because of Brexit?

No. Work on strengthening the European Union’s external border was already under way before the UK referendum on membership in June 2016.

Etias would not be relevant if the UK was still in the EU. But the nation voted to leave the European Union and the British government negotiated for British travellers to be classified as third-country nationals – triggering extra red tape."

Tulfo raised the question of too many foreign travels by the Environment secretary during the Senate plenary deliberation of the DENR’s P24.6-billion budget for 2024. He said Loyzaga and her officials spent P1.1 billion in foreign trips alone this year.

He asked: “What benefit did the people get from these trips?” He said previous DENR secretaries had limited foreign trips, and stayed in the country most of the time to act on various environmental problems of the nation, which were then many as they are now.

Sen. Cynthia Villar, who was then sponsoring the DENR budget, responded on behalf of the DENR, saying the money was not used by the secretary alone but also by officials of the following offices in their foreign travels: Biodiversity Management Bureau, Forest Management Bureau, Land Management Bureau, and Ecosystem’s Research and Management Bureau.

Villar said Loyzaga attends events abroad when only her presence was sought or indispensable, and some of these activities were funded by foreign governments which also give the Philippines financial assistance and loans to promote their environmental initiatives, such as disaster resilience. She noted the DENR was also able to secure financial and technical support for its projects from other countries, including a memorandum of understanding with Japanese and US governments, global environmental facility with European Union under Green Economy Program, and support from Asian Development Bank and World Bank.

She enumerated Loyzaga’s foreign trips: United Nations (UN) Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction, UN Framework on Climate Change, UN Biodiversity Conference in Montreal, UN Water Conference on Sustainable Development in New York, and UN High-Level Meeting on Midterm Review of the Sendai Framework. Villar also said Loyzaga went on official trips to Japan, Washington, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi as well.

Loyzaga’s foreign trips are scheduled to last until December.

We note it is not only Tulfo who had publicly noticed the DENR secretary’s foreign trips that are more numerous than the ordinary. Columnist Rigoberto Tiglao had complained that Loyzaga was nowhere to be found in the early days of the Mindoro oil spill disaster, and if she had done anything to mitigate the maritime and environmental catastrophe, it was not felt much by any of the stakeholders in the region.

We doubt if Villar’s mention of the establishment by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Water Resources Management Office (WRMO) as Loyzaga’s idea could hold water. We know for a fact that there are several pending bills about a department of water resources management but these have not been moving. The WRMO was Malacañang’s stop-gap measure.

While Loyzaga is always away, there is this DENR report that only 709 enterprises out of about 4,000 large corporations submitted their plans under the Expanded Producer Responsibility law or Republic Act 11898, which mandates companies to manage their plastic waste.

It is correct to point out that Loyzaga should always be available on the ground to act on problems here. Let foreigners handle their own, and whatever technical learning we might get from them is always available through modern IT which does not require physical presence."

1141890331,20231122,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland is considering closing some of the four remaining crossing points on its frontier with Russia or even the whole border if a flow of asylum seekers from its neighbour continues, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told Reuters on Wednesday.

In November, more than 600 people without valid travel documents to the European Union have come to Finland via Russia, prompting Helsinki to shut several crossings and accuse Moscow of funnelling migrants. The Kremlin denies the charge.

The asylum seekers come from a wide range of nations including Yemen, Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria, according to immigration authorities.

""We have already taken measures to close border crossing points, and if need be, we will be doing further closings,"" Valtonen said in an interview, adding that closing the entire border was one option the government was currently discussing.

An announcement on border restrictions will be made at 1700 GMT, the government later said.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Russia will ""of course"" respond if Finland closes the remaining border posts between the two countries.

Zakharova did not say what Moscow's reaction would be. Her comments were made before the Reuters interview with Valtonen.

Finland's reception of asylum applications could be moved to a location away from the land border, Valtonen said, but added her country would still adhere to its international obligations and ensure asylum could be sought by ""people in true need"".

Finland joined the NATO military alliance earlier this year in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and had already passed laws to strengthen security on the Russian border last year, fearing Russia's retaliation to its membership would come in the form of orchestrated migration.

The new laws were crafted to enable blocking the 1,340-km (830-mile) frontier and make it possible for the government to direct asylum applications to just one or several border crossings, such as an airport in exceptional circumstances.

Finland has asked the EU's border Agency Frontex for help in managing the situation, EU commissioner Ylva Johansson said in a speech on Monday.

""Finland has now requested additional operational support from Frontex of up to 60 standing corps officers in the coming weeks,"" she said.

Valtonen confirmed observations by the Finnish border guards and said Finnish decision-makers had additional evidence that the Russian border service was transporting the migrants to the border but declined to reveal her sources.

She noted that temperatures in the north were currently dropping to minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4Â°F), making the crossings perilous if migrants did not have sufficient clothing.

""It is even dangerous and life threatening to use such means that Russia is now using,"" she said.

Valtonen said Finland had tried discussing the matter with Russia but Moscow had so far declined to engage in dialogue.

On Wednesday, 51 migrants arrived from Russia to apply for asylum at the Salla border crossing and at least 11 at Vartius in Northern Finland, the Border Guard said."

• Centaurium UAS and Thales have signed a cooperation agreement to conduct a test campaign with a view to authorising the use of ThalesâsÂ UAS100Â drone for long-range operations in Switzerland.
• The UAS100 is ideal for civil and governmental monitoring, surveillance and alert missions.
• Combining world-class flight safety performance with the compact design required for drones, the Thales system has an operating range of more than 100 km and complies with certification criteria for flying over populated areas.
• A subsidiary of Switzerland-based Centaurium Group, a specialist in helicopter operations, Centaurium UAS will be responsible for drone qualification flights, and plans to provide drone services with optimised operating costs and environmental impact to Swiss authorities and industry players.

On 22 November 2023, Centaurium UAS and Thales signed a cooperation agreement which also comprises the delivery of two ThalesÂ UAS100Â drone systems and ground control stations to the Switzerland-based company ahead of testing in the spring of 2024 and the planned start of commercial operations in 2025.

From risk monitoring on large-scale infrastructure to border surveillance, event security, fire detection and location of missing persons, the UAS100 meets the requirements of a wide range of mission scenarios while operating in full compliance with general aviation regulations.

Centaurium UAS will operate the drones and offer services tailored to the specific needs of public and private players in Switzerland, with lower operating costs and 90% lower energy consumption than current piloted aircraft.

Centaurium UAS is positioned as a service provider for monitoring, surveillance and alert missions. Use cases include inspection of critical infrastructure and industrial installations such as high-voltage lines and transport routes, monitoring of natural disasters, border surveillance and security for major events, as well as flights to locate missing persons and provide situational awareness in support of search and rescue and other emergency operations. Centaurium UAS will rely on Thalesâs UAS100 technology for the necessary flight avionics, benefitting from its highly robust design, built-in security, versatility and scalability, and a latest-generation ground control station that meets the criteria for European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification.

The avionics of the UAS100 combines the certified levels of flight safety and security of Thales solutions for the aerospace sector with the lightweight and compact design needed for integration on a light UAV. With an aerostructure developed by light aircraft manufacturer Issoire Aviation, the UAS100 concept offers levels of performance, integrity and reliability with no equivalent in Europe.

The UAS100 is powered by two electric motors and a small internal combustion engine, ensuring the necessary endurance and resilience to failure. Equipped with a jam-resistant navigation system, a redundant computer for critical missions and a smart communication system, it can fly autonomously in complete safety. The UAS100 will be marketed in two versions: the UAS100-1, which is already available and has a wingspan of 3.34 metres, a length of 1.78 metres and a payload capacity of 1 kilogram; and the UAS100-10, which is twice the size and offers a payload capacity of 10 kg to accommodate very high-performance sensors.

The ground control station â the nerve centre for planning, control and supervision of drone operations â will be supplied to Centaurium UAS in November, with delivery of the first UAS100-1 in March 2024 for initial trials. Centaurium UAS plans to begin commercial operations in 2025, once authorisation is obtained from the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA).

âWith Thales, weâre delighted to have found the ideal partner so we can operate on-demand long-range commercial drone services for our customers in the near future. The partnership agreement between Thales and Centaurium UAS marks the start of a new era for drone operations in Switzerland.â âÂ Ernest Oggier, CEO, Centaurium UAS.

âCentaurium UAS isnât only a first customer but the ideal partner to optimise drone operations with a view to achieving system certification and offering commercial services with lower costs and environmental impact.âÂ â Jean-Paul Ebanga, Vice President Flight Avionics, Thales.

The Centaurium Group offers a comprehensive range of aviation services encompassing aircraft trading, safety and compliance management, a CAMO and training organisation, ground handling and MRO services for all types of aircraft, including avionics, as well as a store for pilots. Centaurium Unmanned Aircraft System AG is an independent subsidiary of the Centaurium Group, which operates a drone airline dedicated to monitoring, surveillance and alert tasks. Its customers include government authorities, emergency response agencies and organisations operating critical infrastructure. Centaurium UAS operates in synergy with the Groupâs other subsidiaries and relies on their know-how for all its operational activities. It has operations in Bern, Les Ãplatures, Grenchen and Payerne, Switzerland."

1141899830,20231122,"The European Union has presented a comprehensive framework for member states to provide Ukraine with long-lasting security commitments, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, Nov. 21 after learning about the document.

The proposal will be discussed by EU ambassadors this week and set for consideration by leaders next month, emphasizing longer-term military support, training for Ukrainian forces, and assistance in bolstering the nation’s defense industry.

The project would be based on the following principles:
• “predictable, effective, sustainable and long-term” military support for Ukraine, mobilizing the EU defense industry;
• strengthening Ukraine’s fight against cyberattacks and hybrid threats, as well as disinformation;
• support in the demining of territories;
• assistance in carrying out the reforms necessary for joining the European Union;
• assistance to Ukraine in controlling weapons and countering their illegal trafficking;

The draft paper will also form the basis of consultations with Kyiv and the Group of Seven (G7) nations.

In July, the G7, following the NATO summit, issued a collective statement wherein each member nation committed to long-term responsibilities concerning Ukraine’s security.

The G7 nations vowed to assist in equipping and training the Ukrainian Armed Forces, offering financial, technical, and political backing to Kyiv.

However, the response of the guarantor states in the event of potential Russian military aggression remains ambiguously articulated, primarily involving consultations on necessary support measures.

Furthermore, as EU leaders consider these proposals, challenges emerge in meeting commitments, notably the delayed provision of one million rounds of artillery ammunition by March 2024.

The EU’s initial plan to allocate €20 billion over four years for Kyiv’s weapons faces hurdles, with member states seeking agreement on at least €5 billion for the coming year."
1141903444,20231115,"November 22 - Last week, the European Union unveiled a pioneering regulation aimed at mitigating climate change. This proposed new methane performance standard will introduce penalties akin to a carbon import tax for producers who fail to demonstrate exceptionally low methane emissions.

By 2027, suppliers exporting to the EU will be mandated to present reliable measurements of their methane emissions. This is in anticipation of import penalties that will come into effect in 2030. The regulation imposes even stricter requirements on domestic producers within the EU, over whom the EU has more direct control.

Currently, imports account for 80% of Europe’s oil and gas, and they are the EU’s Achilles’ heel when it comes to its green ambitions. Despite the EU's proactive stance on climate change initiatives, member countries are consuming some of the most polluting hydrocarbons, which are approximately 40% worse in emissions than the global average. These imports are not only environmentally detrimental due to significantly higher embedded emissions from flaring, venting and leaks, they also exhibit a greater emissions intensity compared with other major importers, like India, China, or Japan.

Europe's reliance on high-emission intensity oil and gas imports is influenced by its choice of supplier countries, among them the highest intensity emitters include Libya, Kazakhstan, Iraq, the United States (for oil), and Algeria, Russia, the United States, Nigeria, Azerbaijan and Egypt (for gas). These nations collectively squander approximately 130 billion cubic metres of gas annually through flaring, venting and leaks, much of which could be avoided. This wastage is significant, equating to almost all of the EU's former imports from Russia and resulting in 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions.

In stark contrast to Norway, which has notably low emissions intensity (and the United Kingdom is not far behind), these supplying nations often suffer from lax environmental policies, ineffective legislation, and regulators failing to enforce penalties. Given that most producers, predominantly unlisted national oil companies or their joint ventures with listed companies, are not addressing their emissions voluntarily and existing regulations prove ineffective, the European Union's intervention in this matter is not only necessary but also justified.

At first glance, the EU’s regulations look like they could pose a material threat to producing countries, whilst generating cost increases for importing nations, especially Italy, Spain and Greece. Producing countries would likely face import penalties totalling $2-$3 billion annually, just as the demand for their products decreases as the EU accelerates its energy transition. Consequently, EU buyers might prefer to seek better alternatives, leaving these countries disadvantaged in a competitive market.

However, the impact on consumer prices may be less severe than expected. Capterio’s analysis identifies that the new regulations will add only about a dollar per barrel to the cost of an oil barrel, and perhaps 10 cents per million British thermal units (mmbtu) for gas. Research by energy consultancy Rystad reached a similar conclusion.

More importantly, these regulations present a significant opportunity for exporters.

Rather than merely absorbing methane penalties, the EU regulation should encourage producers to redirect these funds to investments that reduce gas flaring, venting and leaking. As the International Energy Agency (IEA) frequently points out, these projects often offer attractive commercial returns at no net cost, thereby transforming a regulatory challenge into a profitable investment opportunity.

By investing at home to clean up their act, exporting countries will generate several wins. First, countries can enhance the competitiveness of their energy exports, helping them to retain and gain market share, and secure export revenues. Second, countries will bolster their energy security, eliminating the irrational need for traditional gas exporters like Egypt or Iraq to have to import gas from their neighbours at double the price, and create jobs in the process. Lastly countries can improve their investment appeal, decarbonise their economies, and accelerate their own energy transitions.

The new EU regulations mark a critical turning point for producing countries. With the growing satellite monitoring of flaring, methane and CO2, there's increasingly no place to hide. So the message is clear: rather than “active deflection” or “strategic denial”, high-emitting producing countries should embrace their reality, identify, mature and deliver opportunities, and decarbonise.

Since serious financing is required, multilateral development banks should not shy away from getting involved, noting methane reduction projects are particularly cheap ways to abate emissions. This is a moment for these nations to transition from lofty ambitions to tangible actions, driven by both economic and environmental imperatives.

Capterio and the Atlantic Council will be holding a Countdown to COP28: A critical moment to slash methane emissions, on 30 November for those who would like to learn more."
1141904451,20231122,"The European Union’s special representative for human rights, Eamon Gilmore, arrives in communist Cuba today. He can find many human rights violations there, but only if he looks. Of course, the Castro dictatorship will give him a tour of their Potemkin Village and tell him everything is just wonderful on the tropical gulag, but there is no way Gilmore can claim ignorance.

Exiled Cuban independent journalist Camila Rodriguez details five truths about human rights in Cuba Gilmore should be investigating.

As EU visits Havana, five truths about human rights in Cuba

I am writing these words in exile. I left Cuba almost exactly a year ago, after months of being threatened by state security to stop my work defending human rights inside Cuba.

My story is the story of dozens of activists, journalists, political dissidents and non-conformist artists who in the last few years have been forced to board a plane. And in many cases, to also follow the migrant routes that cross half of the American continent to reach a safe place to start over.

On Wednesday (22 November), Eamon Gilmore, the EU special representative for human rights, will arrive in a country in turmoil, as people flee government repression. He will arrive in the midst of an intensified government siege. A willingness to speak with him could lead to, at the very least, hours of interrogation or enforced disappearance for those who wish to share in first person how the Havana regime has oppressed them.

Gilmore’s visit risks legitimising the Cuban regime if he does not take a firm public stance on the human rights situation and voice his solidarity with human rights defenders. A regime that has systematically destroyed the possibility for independent civil society to act, has fragmented a generation of honourable people, has shattered the peace of hundreds of homes, and has worn down, if it was even possible to do so further, the hope for democracy and justice in Cuba.

If my brothers and sisters in this fight who are currently in Cuba cannot speak with Gilmore, if those who attend a meeting in a frigid room surveilled by a photo of a beautiful Cuban beach share a doctored version of our reality, I want to use this space to share five truths that the special representative should know. A reality that he should be aware of before arriving in Cuba and posing with the dictator in an image of smiles and complicity.

Firstly, this visit will take place in the context of a growing systemic crisis. Although the government does not publish updated data on poverty in Cuba, experts have warned of the increasing precarity of life for most citizens.

It has prioritised the construction of hotels for foreign tourism, which is not meeting projected income levels, while public health, education and energy management all lack infrastructure. At the same time, levels of violence, femicides and anti-government public protests are on the rise.

Secondly, since the July 2021 protests, nearly 1,000 people have been detained on the island for political reasons. Most of them from waves of public protests demanding decent living conditions and political freedoms. The current number of political prisoners in Cuba is several times higher than the total number in the rest of the region, even accounting for Nicaragua and Venezuela, which have been singled out for not respecting the right to free expression and association."
1141907573,20231122,"The UK’s new quantum computing missions have been praised as “visionary” and “exciting” plans that can reap financial and geopolitical benefits.

The five long-term moonshots were launched today by the British government.

The first aims to build quantum computers that can run 1 trillion operations by 2035. Another with a deadline for that year is deploying the world’s most advanced quantum network at scale. This initiative aims to pioneer the future quantum internet.

Three other projects have an earlier target date of 2030.

One plans to provide quantum sensing-enabled solutions to every local National Health Service organisation, for use in early diagnosis and treatment of chronic illnesses.

The second intends to equip aircraft with quantum navigation systems. The third aims to unlock new situational awareness with mobile, networked quantum sensors. This would be integrated into critical infrastructure.

“The missions are bold and contain some genuinely exciting and visionary thinking,” said Stuart Woods, COO of Quantum Exponential, a VC fund and accelerator for the sector.

“The plan to implement quantum technology wide scale in the NHS to save money is particularly welcome and our expertise in medical quantum sensing is already world-class — this could greatly accelerate point-of-care diagnostics.”

Analysts have also pointed to the economic benefits. According to McKinsey, quantum computing could create $1.3 trillion ($1.2 trillion) in value by 2035. To maximise its share of that money, the British government is taking a targeted approach.

“The UK can’t outspend the United States, China or the European Union,” Steve Brierley, the CEO of quantum startup Riverlane, told TNW.

“As a nation, we’re unlikely to even outspend some of the US and China’s individual technology giants. But with a focused approach as outlined today, the UK quantum computing industry can work to solve the scaling problem for all quantum computers globally.”

Not everyone is a fan of the plans. Critics argue that governments should minimise their direct involvement in technological development. Instead, they want politicians to focus on fostering the broader investment environment, by providing tax incentives and improving infrastructure.

Brierley would like both forms of support. He points to the examples set in the US, where the government has built NASA for aerospace advances, IARAP for intelligence technologies, DARPA for defence tech, and national labs for supercomputing.

The impact of these bodies has spread far beyond their founding missions. They’ve introduced innovations ranging from GPS and smartphone cameras to a little something called “the internet.”

“Emerging technologies with enormous potential often first need public seed investment to take it from development to commercial stages,” Brierley said. “If done right, early government investment can unlock industries worth billions in the long-term as well as geopolitical advantage.”

That investment, however, remains a concern. Funding for the new missions will reportedly come from the £2.5 billion (€2.86bn) that was previously committed to a 10-year national quantum strategy. Woods believes the ambitious missions will need a bigger cash injection.

“While it’s encouraging to see a commitment from the government across the spectrum of quantum technologies, it is simply not practical for the UK to strive for ‘world-leading’ status in such a range of deep technologies with a £2.5bn, inadequately defined national quantum strategy,” he said."

1141911629,20231122,"Some hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip following the militant group’s attack last month on Israel could be released as early as today (Thursday), after an agreement announced by Qatar that includes Israeli forces pausing their attacks on Gaza for four days.

Qatar said Hamas would release 50 women and children, while Israel would also release “a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons.”

The agreement announced early Wednesday came after weeks of negotiations led by Qatar, the United States (US) and Egypt, according to a senior US administration official.

The US official said the hostages released by Hamas were expected to include several Americans.

“I thank sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar and president Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt for their critical leadership and partnership in reaching this deal,” US president Joe Biden said in a statement.

“And I appreciate the commitment that prime minister Netanyahu and his government have made in supporting an extended pause to ensure this deal can be fully carried out and to ensure the provision of additional humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of innocent Palestinian families in Gaza.”

Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel on 7 October.

Israel said 1 200 people were killed and some 240 captives taken in the terror attack. Gaza health officials say more than 12 000 Palestinians, including at least 5 000 children, have been confirmed killed in Israel’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip.

An Israeli government statement said an extra day would be added to the pause for every additional 10 hostages Hamas releases.

The US senior administration official said more than 50 women and children are among the hostages, and that ultimately the goal is to get all the hostages out of Gaza.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to bring back all of the hostages, while reiterating to Cabinet members that Israel’s goal is to eliminate Hamas and ensure the militant group can no longer threaten Israel.

The Israeli pause in fighting will allow for more humanitarian convoys to bring aid into Gaza, including fuel for humanitarian efforts, Qatar said.

Levels of aid reaching Gaza have been severely limited compared to what was reaching the enclave before the conflict began.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 79 trucks reached the Palestinian enclave on Tuesday, bringing the total during the past month to 1 399 truckloads of aid.

The agency said an average of 10 000 truckloads of commercial and humanitarian commodities were reaching Gaza each month prior to the conflict.

The United Nations (UN) says more than 1,7 million people are displaced within Gaza, including 930 000 people staying at over-capacity UN-run shelters.

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell welcomed the agreement and called for the release of all hostages held by Hamas.

“The humanitarian pause must be used to provide as much urgently needed aid as possible to the civilians enduring the devastating war in Gaza,” Borrell said in a statement.

French foreign minister Catherine Colonna also welcomed the deal, telling France Inter radio that France hopes French nationals are among those released.

In Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the deal the “first good news” in a long time regarding the conflict.

The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas is to free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages taken in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel is to release some Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Egyptian state media say the truce will begin Thursday morning. Egypt helped mediate the cease-fire agreement, which would bring the first respite to war-weary Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before the Cabinet voted early Wednesday to back the agreement that the war would continue even if a deal was reached. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas.

Israel says cease-fire talks are ongoing and hostage release wont’ happen before Friday

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser says a planned hostage-for-prisoner swap with Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.

In a statement released late Wednesday, Tzachi Hanegbi said that contacts on the deal were continuing. “The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday,” he said.

The swap is to take place as part of a four-day truce expected to begin on Thursday.

Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has instructed the country’s Mossad spy agency to track down the leadership of the Hamas militant group living in other countries outside Gaza.

“I have instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas, wherever they are,” Netanyahu told a news conference.

Most of Hamas’ top leadership lives in exile, primarily in the Gulf state of Qatar and the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The Mossad has been accused in a series of assassinations overseas of Palestinian militants and Iranian nuclear scientists over the years.

Over a million displaced in Gaza are sheltering in UN facilities

CAIRO — The U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that almost 1,037,000 internally displaced Palestinians were currently seeking shelter in 156 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip.

In its report, the aid agency said that the number of its workers killed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza stands at 108. The information in the report was valid as of Tuesday.

Earlier Wednesday, UNRWA’s Secretary General, Philippe Lazzarini, gave a press conference in southern Gaza warning that the suffering of Palestinians will only worsen with the coming of winter, and that the besieged territory is on the verge of a waterborne disease outbreak.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a temporary truce was agreed between Israel and Hamas that will facilitate the release of dozens of people taken hostage during the militant group’s assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

The move has been welcomed by UNRWA whose leaders have continually called for a cease-fire.

Netanyahu vows war will keep going after cease-fire

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with Israel’s war against Hamas after a temporary cease-fire expires.

Netanyahu said he delivered the message to Biden in a phone call on Wednesday.

“I want to be clear. The war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals,” Netanyahu said.

A four-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is expected to take effect on Thursday.

Hamas can extend the truce by releasing more of the hostages it is holding.

But Netanyahu, along with the other members of his special war cabinet, told a press conference they will resume the war until Hamas is destroyed and all of the 240 hostages it is holding are released.

Israel releases award-winning Palestinian poet who was detained by troops in Gaza

JERUSALEM — The Israeli army says it has released an award-winning Palestinian poet it detained in Gaza.

Mosab Abu Toha has been contributing pieces to western media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire picture of its toll on civilians through his personal experience.

His family announced Monday that Abu Toha had been arrested while evacuating to southern Gaza from his home in the hard-hit Jabaliya refugee camp.

Abu Toha last posted to X on Nov. 15, writing: “Alive. Thanks for your prayers.”

Diana Buttu, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and friend of the family, said Abu Toha was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint and held for two days with dozens of other Palestinians at an Israeli detention center. She says he was was accused of having Hamas connections and beaten up in custody.

“He was taken out of Gaza and he was interrogated,” she said.

She said he was released on Tuesday, apparently after the case attracted international attention.

The literary and free expression organization PEN said it was concerned about the arrest and demanded to know Abu Toha’s whereabouts and the reason for his arrest. The New Yorker magazine, to which Abu Toha has contributed multiple articles, called for his safe return.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that Abu Toha had been released. It gave no further details.

Buttu said Abu Toha was safe in central Gaza after receiving medical treatment. The poet, whose son is an American citizen, is trying to leave the besieged territory.

Mass Grave for over 100 Palestinians dug into southern Gaza

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — More than 100 bodies were buried Wednesday in a mass grave in Khan Younis, the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheets fastened with cable ties.

Medical workers placed dozens of bodies brought from various areas in northern Gaza, including Shifa Hospital, into a huge trench that was dug using a bulldozer.

Workers wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the bodies to the grave and performed funeral prayers.

GENEVA — International aid groups that have lined up thousands of aid trucks for Gaza say they’re ready to move quickly to send in food, water and other supplies if a pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel takes hold as hoped on Thursday.

Details remain unclear about both the mechanics of getting more aid for beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza and the possible release of hostages kidnapped from Israel whose families have desperately sought their release.

The aid groups say a key ambition will be to get help to northern Gaza, which has been largely inaccessible to humanitarian shipments and where nearly all hospitals have stopped working amid a blistering military campaign by Israeli forces.

“The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to the fine print of the announced deal.

Della Longa lamented “bottlenecks” that have confounded the deliveries of some humanitarian aid – though not nearly enough – into Gaza. He said IFRC hopes that a deal would include provisions to allow for a “faster track” of aid shipments.

The only route for international humanitarian aid into Gaza since Oct. 7 has been through the Rafah Crossing into Egypt, and planeloads of supplies have been flown into the nearby Egyptian city of El-Arish – and trucks have queued up near Gaza.

Intense Israeli inspections of trucks and cargo have slowed entry into Gaza.

Iranian-backed militant group vows to expand conflict if U.S. airstrikes continue

WASHINGTON — A major Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq has warned it may strike additional U.S. targets after U.S. warplanes killed multiple militants in response to the first use of short-range ballistic missiles against U.S. forces at Al-Asad Air Base earlier this week.

U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and a Kataib Hezbollah command and control node south of Baghdad on Tuesday, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional sensitive details of the attacks.

There were Kataib Hezbollah personnel at both sites at the time of the strikes, but the officials said they could not yet confirm whether anyone there was killed.

Militia officials in Iraq said the attack had killed eight Kataib Hezbollah members.

Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday that it was considering “expanding the scope of targets” if the U.S. military continues with its strikes, adding that the attack “will not go unpunished.”

The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities on Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. The attacks have continued unabated since, with at least 66 rocket and missile attacks hitting U.S. facilities and wounding at least 62 service members.

Tara Copp reported from Washington, D.C., and Kareem Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

Swiss parliament to consider ban on Hamas

GENEVA — Switzerland’s executive branch said Wednesday it will ask parliament to ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The Federal Council said the government will also end contracts it has with three Palestinian non-governmental organizations. They were among 11 Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that had been under review by Swiss officials following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.

Four days after the deadly rampage in Israel, the council moved to designate Hamas as a terrorist group and instructed the Foreign Ministry to consider a possible ban.

The seven-member council, which includes the Swiss president, reiterated its condemnation of the attacks “in the strongest possible terms” and expressed its regret about the deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict.

The United States and the European Union, which does not count Switzerland as a member, have long considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on the international community to provide “timely and sustained humanitarian assistance” to the Palestinians in Gaza.

Modi was speaking at a virtual meeting of Group of 20 nations on Wednesday before India’s presidency ends on Nov. 30.

“We agree that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians anywhere is condemnable,” Modi said. “We welcome the news today concerning the release of the hostages. We hope that all the hostages will be released soon.”

Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war in Gaza — a breakthrough that will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and bring a large influx of aid to the besieged territory, officials said Wednesday.

“It is important to provide timely and sustained humanitarian assistance. It is also important to ensure that the war between Israel and Hamas does not take any regional form,” Modi said.

CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says the Israel-Hamas truce will take effect at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) Thursday.

Egypt helped mediate the four-day cease-fire, which will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The deal will also see the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israeli media also reported that the truce would begin Thursday at 10 a.m.

CAIRO — The World Health Organization has documented 178 attacks on healthcare facilities that killed 553 people, including 22 healthcare workers, since the war started on Oct. 7, the agency’s regional director said Wednesday.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari said in an online briefing that about 800 people, including 48 healthcare workers, were injured in the attacks, which damaged 24 hospitals and 32 ambulances.

The war has forced the shutdown of 27 out of 36 hospitals and 47 out of 72 primary health care clinics across Gaza, he said. The facilities stopping providing services mainly because of a lack of fuel and attacks, he said.

“Hospitals must be allowed to replenish the resources they need to continue functioning,” he said. “We cannot keep providing drops of aid in an ocean of needs.”

WHO staff member, family are killed in strike

CAIRO — The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering.

It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers.

The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike.

WATCH: Another hospital in northern Gaza becomes battleground between Israel and Hamas

Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.”

Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives.

WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.”

Pope begs for peace and end to terrorism

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.”

In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives in Gaza.

Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath.

Francis said: “Here we’ve gone beyond war. This isn’t war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.”

He also asked for God to help both Israeli and Palestinian people “resolve problems and not go forward with passions that are killing everyone in the end.”

Francis has spoken out repeatedly for an end to the war.

Israel publishes list of Palestinian prisoners who could be released under hostage deal

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s Justice Ministry has published a list of 300 Palestinian detainees and prisoners who could potentially be released in a hostage deal.

Most of those on the list published Wednesday are teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses, including throwing rocks or alleged incitement. None was convicted of murder, though some served sentences for attempted murder.

The youngest detainee on the list is 14, and it also includes around 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

According to the truce-for-hostages deal announced Wednesday, 50 hostages will be released over four days, likely starting Thursday, during which fighting will pause.

After that, every additional 10 hostages released will result in one additional day in the pause and the release of additional Palestinian prisoners.

Israel is expected to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in the first four days, though the Ministry of Justice published the list of 300 in case the deal is extended. Under Israeli law, the public has 24 hours to object to any release.

CAIRO — The evacuation of patients trapped in Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has begun, the Palestinian Red Crecent says.

The charity said 14 ambulances arrived at the hospital on Wednesday, and the evacuation has been coordinated with the United Nations and Doctors without Borders medical group.

Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, has said there were over 250 patients at the facility, which was besieged by the Israeli military earlier this month. Over 400 displaced people sheltering in the facility have also been trapped there, he said.

Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital, the largest in Gaza, to conduct militant operations. Hamas and health officials have denied the allegation.

Over the weekend, the World Health Organization coordinated the evacuation of 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza. Of them, 28 babies were later transferred to Egypt.

EU official says halt in fighting must be used to flood Gaza with aid

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s crisis management chief has welcomed the Israeli hostage release agreement and says the halt in fighting that is part of the deal must be used to flood Gaza with desperately needed aid.

“We hope that the agreement on a pause of hostilities that has just been reached will allow for a substantial surge in humanitarian aid delivery into and within Gaza,” Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic said Wednesday.

“We certainly hope that this will not be a one-off,” he told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, and called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses throughout Gaza.”

The 27-nation EU is the world’s biggest aid donor to the Palestinians. Lenarcic said 15 EU aid cargo flights have been sent, with most of that aid already in Gaza, and that more is on the way.

The bloc insists that more trucks must be allowed through the Rafah crossing point with Egypt and other corridors opened.

Lenarcic said getting into Gaza is “extremely challenging” and that fewer than 50 trucks a day make it through, a number which he described as “woefully inadequate.” He welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some fuel in, but said it only covers about one third of Gaza’s basic needs.

Britain urges both sides to ensure hostage agreement is ‘delivered in full’

LONDON — The British government has welcomed an agreement to release some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza and urged all parties to ensure it is “delivered in full.”

Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the agreement was “a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

“This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis,” he said. “The U.K. will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.”

China says it hopes truce agreement will ease tensions

BEIJING — The Chinese government says it welcomes the four-day truce reached between Israel and Hamas.

“We welcome the provisional truce reached by the parties concerned and hope it will help to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, de-escalate the conflict and ease tensions,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.

China has been calling for a cease-fire and refrained from criticizing the initial Hamas attack on Israel that started the latest conflict.

Security Council.

Russia says truce is a step toward ending hostilities

MOSCOW — The Kremlin on Wednesday hailed a deal between Israel and Hamas for a halt to the war and the release of hostages as step toward ending the hostilities.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the announcement of the deal was “the first good news from Gaza in a long time.”

Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he noted that Russia along with most other countries had called for a truce and humanitarian pauses, adding that “only on the basis of such pauses future attempts to find a lasting settlement to the problem could be made.”

France hopeful its nationals will be among the first released under deal

PARIS — France’s foreign minister says she’s hopeful that French nationals will be among the first hostages released as part of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas.

“We hope that French nationals are among them and even, if possible, among the first group that will be released,” the minister, Catherine Colonna, said Wednesday on France Inter radio. “We are working for that.”

France counts eight people missing, some of them confirmed as hostages, from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants that ignited their latest and deadliest war. France also counts 40 killed in the attack. Colonna said that not all the hostages taken on Oct. 7 were captured by Hamas. But she said that in the course of negotiations, the militant group has said that “it could assemble together all of the hostages.”

In a message on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said “we are working tirelessly to ensure that all hostages are released.” He also hoped the truce will “enable aid to be brought in” and help the Gaza people.

Turkey says it hopes truce will lead to lasting peace

ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey, a vocal critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza, welcomed the four-day truce as a “positive development to prevent more bloodshed.”

A Foreign Ministry statement released Wednesday said Turkey expects full compliance with the agreement.

“We hope that the humanitarian pause will help permanently end the current conflict as soon as possible and initiate a process towards a just and lasting peace based on a two-state solution,” it said.

U.S. strikes back at Iran-backed militants in Iraq

BAGHDAD — The United States military said Wednesday that it has carried out strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have launched attacks on U.S. forces.

The U.S. Central Command said in a statement Wednesday that its forces had “conducted discrete, precision strikes against two facilities in Iraq … in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups,” including one on Tuesday involving the use of close-range ballistic missiles.

Two officials with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said the strikes hit three locations in the area of Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad, killing eight members of the Kataeb Hezbollah militant group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Iranian-backed militants have launched dozens of attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. While most of the more than five dozen attacks have been ineffective, at least 60 U.S. personnel have reported minor injuries. The militant groups have said the strikes are in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

JERUSALEM — The Israeli military released a video Wednesday that appeared to show its personnel engaged in house-to-house search operations.

Soldiers with laser pointers on their weapons filed into homes and patrolled narrow, debris-strewn alleyways, some next to the Gaza seafront. The patrols were supported by demolition teams, airstrikes and naval strikes.

Soldiers, deployed for a possible evacuation of German citizens, return home

BERLIN — The German government is bringing home most of the soldiers that were deployed to the eastern Mediterranean for a possible evacuation of German citizens from Lebanon.

About 1,000 German soldiers are to leave the island of Cyprus starting Wednesday, according to German news agency dpa. A small team of about 200 as well as material and equipment will remain behind. The decision was made following an assessment of the current conflict in the Middle East.

“The Bundeswehr generally keeps its resources available for evacuation operations in such a way that it can react flexibly to crisis situations worldwide,” the German defense ministry and foreign office said in a joint statement. The forces brought back to Germany will be kept on call at short notice to “be able to react quickly in the event of a worsening situation,” it said.

The special forces would have been deployed to evacuate German citizens from Lebanon in case the war spread there.

ROME — Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted a townhall meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday, booing and heckling him when he addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The protesters chanted “Shame on you” and accused Kristersson of supporting genocide after he said Sweden condemns Hamas and supports Israel’s right to self-defense. Police removed some of them from the venue in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second biggest city.

Kristersson criticized the protesters in a Facebook post after the event.

“When we met tonight with a few hundred Gothenburgers the meeting was disrupted by a screaming and shouting group of people who refused to respect everyone else who had come to ask questions,” he wrote. “These political saboteurs appeared to have come to our question-and-answer session only to shout out their anger over Sweden and the EU’s political position about the conflict in the Middle East -– they were particularly disappointed over the condemnation of the terror organization Hamas.”

Kristersson’s center-right government has strongly sided with Israel in the Gaza conflict, condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and supporting Israel’s right to self-defense. Pro-Palestinian groups and the left-leaning opposition have accused the government of ignoring the plight of Palestinian civilians."
1141917646,20231122,"A late surge in support could situate the anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders to play a key role in shaping the next Dutch government following Wednesday's (22 September) parliamentary elections.

For most of the year, his political fortunes seemed spent, with support for his party dwindling to seven percent during the spring and early summer.

Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.

But a Tuesday poll showed Wilders' Freedom party (PVV) tied in first place with the labour-green coalition led by former EU heavyweight Frans Timmermans and the centre-right liberal VVD party of outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte.

There is not one easy explanation for his comeback, but it appears to have started when the populist Farmers Party (BBB), with whom he shares significant voter overlap, started losing support over the summer.

No doubt his anti-Islam message was boosted by the mass slaughter committed by Hamas and the Israeli government, which respectively left 1,400 people killed in Israel and over 14,000 dead in Gaza.

But nothing has helped his last-minute success more than his avowed 'mildness.' Following 11 years of hard opposition, he launched his campaign, saying he was ""ready to compromise on Islam.""

""The Islam is in our DNA, but there are other things more important right now,"" he recently said during a televised interview with Dutch news channel Nieuwsuur.

His party programme still demands the Netherlands end all migration and exit the European Union — aims that can hardly be described as mild.

""The party's strength lies in its consistency. Wilders' message has hardly changed over the past 15 years,"" political scientist Simon Otjes concluded this week after analysing his electorate.

His voters — it turns out — support him not for his mildness but for his unyielding islamophobia. But Wilders' milder vibe shift was well timed and most Dutch political press ate it up.

""While his desire to close the borders remains intact, Wilders no longer presented it as an absolute condition,"" longtime political commentator Frits Wester remarked in October.

This, he concluded, ""signalled a willingness to make compromises.""

But the initial whiff of acceptability quickly morphed into a storm of renewed enthusiasm for his nativist, anti-Islam message when voters started to realise Dilan Yeşilgöz — Rutte's successor as VVD leader — was much more amenable to forming a coalition with him.

This turned out to be a mistake. Although never formally excluding him from government, everybody understood Rutte would never form a coalition with Wilders again after their minority government fell prematurely in 2012.

Yeşilgöz tried to play the same game. She stopped short from endorsing a future coalition with Wilders and roughly followed Rutte's line of feigned disinterest.

But she turned out to be much less adept at countering Wilders' in the following TV debates.

Yeşilgöz abruptly rediscovered ""Wilders [conviction to] exclude certain people"" in an attempt to halt the momentum shift — with little sign of success.

The prevailing election narrative now goes that Wilders has run a clean campaign and has deftly used his opponent's weaknesses to his advantage.

In a sense, this could justify his potential electoral success on Wednesday. Yet his success is built on the failings of journalists and his political opponents to recognise his claim to mildness for the hollow spin that it is.

His Party for Freedom is the only major party proposing a full stop to migration; he supports a so-called 'Nexit' referendum (the Dutch leaving the EU); he wants to prohibit Korans and mosques and wants to revoke legal asylum-permits of Syrians, claiming that war-torn Syria is ""safe.""

Legal residents returning home to their families would lose their permit to stay, if up to Wilders. Despite his promises that Islam is no longer his top priority, his party programme reflects on the war in Gaza extensively.

As a response to the crisis, he wants to shutter the Dutch consulate with the ""corrupt"" Palestinian authorities in Ramallah, describing Jordan as ""the only Palestinian state.""

He wants to revoke the €28bn climate fund, an achievement the last government fought hard for; he wants to expand oil- and gas extraction in the North Sea and stop deploying wind and solar parks.

He wants to cancel the 1951 UN refugee convention that outlines a refugee's legal protection and rights. And if left to Wilders, the EU climate law and the 2015 UN Climate Agreement are ""heading straight to the shredder."""

Israel’s national security adviser says cease-fire talks with the Hamas militant group are ongoing, and a hostage release will not take place before Friday

Israel’s national security adviser said late Wednesday that cease-fire talks with the Hamas militant group were still ongoing, and the hostage release will not take place before Friday. Tzachi Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

The cease-fire agreement between the Hamas militant group and Israel had earlier been confirmed by both parties, along with Washington and Qatar, which helped broker the deal that would bring a temporary halt to the devastating war that is now in its seventh week.

The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas will free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages taken in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel will release some Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Egyptian state media say the truce will begin Thursday morning. Egypt helped mediate the cease-fire agreement, which would bring the first respite to war-weary Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Wednesday he told U.S. President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with the war after a cease-fire expires. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United States military says one of its warships in the Red Sea has shot down bomb-carrying drones launched from territory controlled by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.

The military arm of Yemen’s Houthi rebels said earlier Wednesday that it launched a batch of long-range large missiles toward southern Israel, including the Red Sea city of Eilat. The Iran-backed rebel group has launched at least six aerial attacks against Israel since the conflict broke out on Oct. 7.

The Houthi are staunch foes of Israel and have vowed to continue aerial attacks and hijackings of Israeli ships.

The American military’s Central Command said the USS Thomas Hudner, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, shot down the drones early Thursday morning.

“The ship and crew sustained no damage or injury,” Central Command said, but did not identify what it believed the drones were targeting.

BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon late Wednesday is believed to have killed the son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc in Lebanon, Mohammed Raad. Hezbollah announced early Thursday that five of its fighters were killed, among them Abbas Mohammed Raad, identified by local media as the son of the legislator.

The Lebanese militant group has a political wing that has long held seats in the country’s parliament.

The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli airstrike on a house in the town of Beit Yahoun late Wednesday killed four people and wounded one. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike.

On Wednesday, Hamas announced that Khalil Kharraz, a commander of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon, was killed in an Israeli airstrike the day before. Also on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike killed two journalists from the pan-Arab TV channel Al Mayadeen as they were reporting in south Lebanon. The Israeli military has said it is looking into the incident.

The Lebanon-Israel border has seen daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. While mostly limited to the border area, the clashes have stirred fears of a wider regional war.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser says a planned hostage-for-prisoner swap with Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.

In a statement released late Wednesday, Tzachi Hanegbi said that contacts on the deal were continuing. “The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday,” he said.

The swap is to take place as part of a four-day truce expected to begin on Thursday.

Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has instructed the country's Mossad spy agency to track down the leadership of the Hamas militant group living in other countries outside Gaza.

“I have instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas, wherever they are,” Netanyahu told a news conference.

Most of Hamas’ top leadership lives in exile, primarily in the Gulf state of Qatar and the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The Mossad has been accused in a series of assassinations overseas of Palestinian militants and Iranian nuclear scientists over the years.

CAIRO — The U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that almost 1,037,000 internally displaced Palestinians were currently seeking shelter in 156 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip.

In its report, the aid agency said that the number of its workers killed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza stands at 108. The information in the report was valid as of Tuesday.

Earlier Wednesday, UNRWA’s Secretary General, Philippe Lazzarini, gave a press conference in southern Gaza warning that the suffering of Palestinians will only worsen with the coming of winter, and that the besieged territory is on the verge of a waterborne disease outbreak.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a temporary truce was agreed between Israel and Hamas that will facilitate the release of dozens of people taken hostage during the militant group’s assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

The move has been welcomed by UNRWA whose leaders have continually called for a cease-fire.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with Israel’s war against Hamas after a temporary cease-fire expires.

Netanyahu said he delivered the message to Biden in a phone call on Wednesday.

“I want to be clear. The war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals,” Netanyahu said.

A four-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is expected to take effect on Thursday.

Hamas can extend the truce by releasing more of the hostages it is holding.

But Netanyahu, along with the other members of his special war cabinet, told a press conference they will resume the war until Hamas is destroyed and all of the 240 hostages it is holding are released.

JERUSALEM — The Israeli army says it has released an award-winning Palestinian poet it detained in Gaza.

Mosab Abu Toha has been contributing pieces to western media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire picture of its toll on civilians through his personal experience.

His family announced Monday that Abu Toha had been arrested while evacuating to southern Gaza from his home in the hard-hit Jabaliya refugee camp. Abu Toha last posted to X on Nov. 15, writing: “Alive. Thanks for your prayers.”

Diana Buttu, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and friend of the family, said Abu Toha was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint and held for two days with dozens of other Palestinians at an Israeli detention center. She says he was was accused of having Hamas connections and beaten up in custody. She said he was released on Tuesday, apparently after the case attracted international attention.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that Abu Toha had been released. It gave no further details.

Buttu said Abu Toha was safe in central Gaza after receiving medical treatment. The poet, whose son is an American citizen, is trying to leave the besieged territory.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — More than 100 bodies were buried Wednesday in a mass grave in Khan Younis, the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheets fastened with cable ties.

Medical workers placed dozens of bodies brought from various areas in northern Gaza, including Shifa Hospital, into a huge trench that was dug using a bulldozer.

Workers wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the bodies to the grave and performed funeral prayers.

GENEVA — International aid groups that have lined up thousands of aid trucks for Gaza say they’re ready to move quickly to send in food, water and other supplies during an agreed, but yet undated, pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Details remain unclear about both the mechanics of getting more aid for beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza and the possible release of hostages kidnapped from Israel whose families have desperately sought their release.

“The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to the fine print of the announced deal.

Della Longa lamented bottlenecks that have confounded the scant deliveries of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He said IFRC hopes that a deal would include provisions to allow for a “faster track” of aid shipments.

The only route for international humanitarian aid into Gaza since Oct. 7 has been through the Rafah Crossing into Egypt, and planeloads of supplies have been flown into the nearby Egyptian city of El-Arish — and trucks have queued up near Gaza, where intense Israeli inspections of trucks and cargo have slowed entry.

WASHINGTON — A major Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq has warned it may strike additional U.S. targets after U.S. warplanes killed multiple militants in response to the first use of short-range ballistic missiles against U.S. forces at Al-Asad Air Base earlier this week.

U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and a Kataib Hezbollah command and control node south of Baghdad on Tuesday, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional sensitive details of the attacks.

There were Kataib Hezbollah personnel at both sites at the time of the strikes, but the officials said they could not yet confirm whether anyone there was killed.

Militia officials in Iraq said the attack had killed eight Kataib Hezbollah members.

Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday that it was considering “expanding the scope of targets” if the U.S. military continues with its strikes, adding that the attack “will not go unpunished.”

The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities on Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. The attacks have continued unabated since, with at least 66 rocket and missile attacks hitting U.S. facilities and wounding at least 62 service members.

Associated Press writers Tara Copp in Washington, D.C., and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed.

GENEVA — Switzerland’s executive branch said Wednesday it will ask parliament to ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The Federal Council said the government will also end contracts it has with three Palestinian non-governmental organizations. They were among 11 Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that had been under review by Swiss officials following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.

Four days after the deadly rampage in Israel, the council moved to designate Hamas as a terrorist group and instructed the Foreign Ministry to consider a possible ban.

The seven-member council, which includes the Swiss president, reiterated its condemnation of the attacks “in the strongest possible terms” and expressed its regret about the deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict.

The United States and the European Union, which does not count Switzerland as a member, have long considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on the international community to provide “timely and sustained humanitarian assistance” to the Palestinians in Gaza.

Modi was speaking at a virtual meeting of Group of 20 nations on Wednesday before India’s presidency ends on Nov. 30.

“We agree that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians anywhere is condemnable,"" Modi said. ""We welcome the news today concerning the release of the hostages. We hope that all the hostages will be released soon.”

Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war in Gaza — a breakthrough that will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and bring a large influx of aid to the besieged territory, officials said Wednesday.

“It is important to provide timely and sustained humanitarian assistance. It is also important to ensure that the war between Israel and Hamas does not take any regional form,” Modi said.

CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says the Israel-Hamas truce will take effect at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) Thursday.

Egypt helped mediate the four-day cease-fire, which will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The deal will also see the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israeli media also reported that the truce would begin Thursday at 10 a.m.

CAIRO — The World Health Organization has documented 178 attacks on healthcare facilities that killed 553 people, including 22 healthcare workers, since the war started on Oct. 7, the agency’s regional director said Wednesday.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari said in an online briefing that about 800 people, including 48 healthcare workers, were injured in the attacks, which damaged 24 hospitals and 32 ambulances.

The war has forced the shutdown of 27 out of 36 hospitals and 47 out of 72 primary health care clinics across Gaza, he said. The facilities stopping providing services mainly because of a lack of fuel and attacks, he said.

“Hospitals must be allowed to replenish the resources they need to continue functioning,” he said. “We cannot keep providing drops of aid in an ocean of needs.”

CAIRO — The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering.

It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers.

The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike.

Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.”

Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives.

WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.""

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.”

In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives in Gaza.

Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath.

Francis said: “Here we’ve gone beyond war. This isn’t war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.”

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s Justice Ministry has published a list of 300 Palestinian detainees and prisoners who could potentially be released in a hostage deal.

Most of those on the list published Wednesday are teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses, including throwing rocks or alleged incitement. None was convicted of murder, though some served sentences for attempted murder.

The youngest detainee on the list is 14, and it also includes around 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

According to the truce-for-hostages deal announced Wednesday, 50 hostages will be released over four days, likely starting Thursday, during which fighting will pause.

After that, every additional 10 hostages released will result in one additional day in the pause and the release of additional Palestinian prisoners.

Israel is expected to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in the first four days, though the Ministry of Justice published the list of 300 in case the deal is extended. Under Israeli law, the public has 24 hours to object to any release.

CAIRO — The evacuation of patients trapped in Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has begun, the Palestinian Red Crescent says.

The charity said 14 ambulances arrived at the hospital on Wednesday, and the evacuation has been coordinated with the United Nations and Doctors without Borders medical group.

Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, has said there were over 250 patients at the facility, which was besieged by the Israeli military earlier this month. Over 400 displaced people sheltering in the facility have also been trapped there, he said.

Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital, the largest in Gaza, to conduct militant operations. Hamas and health officials have denied the allegation.

Over the weekend, the World Health Organization coordinated the evacuation of 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza. Of them, 28 babies were later transferred to Egypt.

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s crisis management chief has welcomed the Israeli hostage release agreement and says the halt in fighting that is part of the deal must be used to flood Gaza with desperately needed aid.

“We hope that the agreement on a pause of hostilities that has just been reached will allow for a substantial surge in humanitarian aid delivery into and within Gaza,” Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic said Wednesday.

“We certainly hope that this will not be a one-off,” he told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, and called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses throughout Gaza.”

The 27-nation EU is the world’s biggest aid donor to the Palestinians. Lenarcic said 15 EU aid cargo flights have been sent, with most of that aid already in Gaza, and that more is on the way.

Lenarcic said getting into Gaza is “extremely challenging” and that fewer than 50 trucks a day make it through, a number which he described as “woefully inadequate.” He welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some fuel in, but said it only covers about one third of Gaza’s basic needs.

LONDON — The British government has welcomed an agreement to release some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza and urged all parties to ensure it is “delivered in full.”

Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the agreement was “a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

“This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis,” he said. “The U.K. will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.”

BEIJING — The Chinese government says it welcomes the four-day truce reached between Israel and Hamas.

“We welcome the provisional truce reached by the parties concerned and hope it will help to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, de-escalate the conflict and ease tensions,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.

China has been calling for a cease-fire and refrained from criticizing the initial Hamas attack on Israel that started the latest conflict. A delegation of foreign ministers from Arab nations and Indonesia held talks with China’s foreign minister this week as they started a tour to press their case for a cease-fire with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.

MOSCOW — The Kremlin on Wednesday hailed a deal between Israel and Hamas for a halt to the war and the release of hostages as step toward ending the hostilities.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the announcement of the deal was “the first good news from Gaza in a long time.”

Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he noted that Russia along with most other countries had called for a truce and humanitarian pauses, adding that “only on the basis of such pauses future attempts to find a lasting settlement to the problem could be made.”

PARIS — France’s foreign minister says she’s hopeful that French nationals will be among the first hostages released as part of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas.

“We hope that French nationals are among them and even, if possible, among the first group that will be released,” the minister, Catherine Colonna, said Wednesday on France Inter radio. “We are working for that.”

France counts eight people missing, some of them confirmed as hostages, from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants that ignited their latest and deadliest war. France also counts 40 killed in the attack. Colonna said that not all the hostages taken on Oct. 7 were captured by Hamas. But she said that in the course of negotiations, the militant group has said that “it could assemble together all of the hostages.”

In a message on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said “we are working tirelessly to ensure that all hostages are released.” He also hoped the truce will “enable aid to be brought in” and help the Gaza people.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey, a vocal critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza, welcomed the four-day truce as a “positive development to prevent more bloodshed.”

A Foreign Ministry statement released Wednesday said Turkey expects full compliance with the agreement.

“We hope that the humanitarian pause will help permanently end the current conflict as soon as possible and initiate a process towards a just and lasting peace based on a two-state solution,” it said.

BAGHDAD — The United States military said Wednesday that it has carried out strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have launched attacks on U.S. forces.

The U.S. Central Command said in a statement Wednesday that its forces had “conducted discrete, precision strikes against two facilities in Iraq … in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups,” including one on Tuesday involving the use of close-range ballistic missiles.

Two officials with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said the strikes hit three locations in the area of Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad, killing eight members of the Kataeb Hezbollah militant group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Iranian-backed militants have launched dozens of attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. While most of the more than five dozen attacks have been ineffective, at least 60 U.S. personnel have reported minor injuries. The militant groups have said the strikes are in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

ROME — Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted a town hall meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday, booing and heckling him when he addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The protesters chanted “Shame on you” and accused Kristersson of supporting genocide after he said Sweden condemns Hamas and supports Israel’s right to self-defense. Police removed some of them from the venue in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second biggest city.

Kristersson criticized the protesters in a Facebook post after the event.

“When we met tonight with a few hundred Gothenburgers the meeting was disrupted by a screaming and shouting group of people who refused to respect everyone else who had come to ask questions,” he wrote. “These political saboteurs appeared to have come to our question-and-answer session only to shout out their anger over Sweden and the EU’s political position about the conflict in the Middle East -– they were particularly disappointed over the condemnation of the terror organization Hamas.”

Kristersson’s center-right government has strongly sided with Israel in the Gaza conflict, condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and supporting Israel’s right to self-defense. Pro-Palestinian groups and the left-leaning opposition have accused the government of ignoring the plight of Palestinian civilians."
1141917659,20231122,"The breakthrough between Israel and Hamas that will see dozens of hostages and prisoners released from both sides — and more aid flow into Gaza — almost never happened.

Talks over an agreement to free some of the captives held in Gaza began soon after Hamas’s forces stormed into Israel last month and took an estimated 240 hostages back with them, according to U.S. and Qatari officials who briefed reporters as the latest deal was announced.

But it wasn’t clear the negotiations in Doha would succeed.

Fury over the damage wrought by Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack that left 1,200 dead, and an Israeli response that authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip say has killed thousands since, hung over the negotiators. The hurdles included demands to provide proof-of-life details for the hostages and questions over the practicality of Israeli forces remaining in Gaza during a pause in battle.

“There were some very difficult moments, the agreement was nearly sabotaged because of events on the ground,” said Majed Al-Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar’s ministry of foreign affairs.

As Israel’s closest ally, the U.S. was under pressure to support its historic partner — and find a way to secure the release of nearly a dozen Americans taken in the Hamas offensive. President Joe Biden flew to Israel less than two weeks after the attack, publicly defending Israel’s right to self-defense but privately pushing for a deal to get hostages freed. He also warily eyed rising frustration in his party over Israel’s counterattacks against Hamas in the densely populated Gaza Strip.

For the Biden team, a sliver of hope emerged when Hamas — a designated terrorist group by the U.S. and European Union — freed an American mother and her daughter on Oct. 20 and Qatar’s leader, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, got directly involved in the talks.

Hamas’s release of Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie, helped give White House officials confidence that negotiations through Doha could yield results, according to a U.S. official who briefed reporters late Tuesday. The Raanans had been taken from Israel’s Kibbutz Nahal Oz, the site of one of the bloodiest massacres in the Hamas attack.

That was the first key success of a working group put together earlier by the Qataris, working with Egypt and a pair of officials that U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan directed to get involved: Brett McGurk — a veteran diplomat who served as the top American envoy to the global coalition to defeat Islamic State — and Josh Geltzer.

Qatar had been outraged by Hamas’s hostage-taking and thought they should all be freed unconditionally, according to the U.S. official. Hamas, for its part, wanted to free Palestinians held in Israeli jails and secure a break in the fighting, which was quickly devastating Gaza. Hamas’s side was led in Doha by Ismail Haniyeh, the group’s former leader, but details also had to go through Yahya Sinwar, its leader in Gaza.

“There’s a heightened emotional state, political polarization, and the international situation that’s very chaotic in dealing with the situation,” al-Ansari said. “All this amid a complete lack of trust between both sides and with both sides having to cater to their audiences.”

The situation on the ground didn’t help. Communication systems were in disarray: messages had to be passed from Doha or Cairo into Gaza and back, an official said. And then the reality of trying to negotiate a temporary truce from Qatar, with hostages languishing in Gaza and Israeli troops and tanks in streets recently controlled by Hamas, proved nearly impossible.

“You want to move people within a war zone where infrastructure is all destroyed and there’s severed communication,” al-Ansari continued. “And it’s all happened from Doha, working with the Hamas political office. But also you needed to agree on every specific detail on this.”

A U.S. official concurred, saying the negotiations dealt with everything from exit corridors to surveillance to time frames to total numbers of captives who would be freed.

As the talks progressed, Hamas said they could guarantee the release of 50 hostages in an initial phase. Israel demanded details such as the ages, genders and nationalities of hostages to be freed. But Hamas produced identifying criteria for only about 10 captives. That move, around Nov. 9 according to an American official, wasn’t good enough for Israel and the U.S.

Biden reiterated demands for more information during a Nov. 12 call with Qatar’s Sheikh Tamim, who made clear he would do everything possible to secure a deal. Soon after that conversation, Hamas produced identifying information for 50 women and children who would be freed.

Buoyed by that progress, Biden called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Nov. 14 and said he thought it was probably time to move forward with a deal. Netanyahu ultimately agreed. After that call, Israeli minister and former ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer called Jake Sullivan with a formula that was approved by Israeli’s war cabinet.

Those conversations convinced the U.S. that they were closing in on a deal, but talks stalled when Hamas went silent for several days, resuming only when Biden traveled to San Francisco for a summit of leaders from the Asia Pacific.

Trying to keep things on track, Biden and Tamim spoke again on Nov. 17. The president said the deal had to close, adding that the onus was on Hamas to act. It was only within the last 48 hours that Hamas addressed what the official characterized as fairly significant differences, giving Israel the confidence to move forward, the U.S. official said.

The Israelis initially insisted — and the White House agreed — that Hamas ensure the release of all women and children in this first phase, the U.S. official said. But that didn’t happen. While Hamas will still hold women and children after the first group of captives is freed, the U.S. official expressed optimism there would be a second phase of releases.

As announced early Wednesday, the deal allows for a four-day pause, during which 50 hostages in Gaza will be freed, along with dozens of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces will remain in Gaza, but the airspace above the narrow territory is supposed to be free of Israel Defense Forces drones and planes.

The U.S. official said the Biden administration hoped the deal would lead to a cessation in fighting with Hezbollah along the Israeli-Lebanese border, though that wasn’t spelled out in the public announcements from Israel, Qatar or Hamas.

Most importantly for now, the truce could be extended by a day for every additional group of 10 hostages Hamas frees.

Among the American hostages who meet the criteria for release are a three-year-old girl named Abigail and two women, the U.S. official said. There are 10 Americans still unaccounted for and the U.S. is determined to eventually secure the release of all of them, a U.S. official said.

Much about the agreement could still go awry, but the deal appears to address the interests of both Hamas and Israel, as well as the U.S., for now.

But while the lull in fighting could be extended, Israel’s government made clear the war isn’t over.

“There is nonsense out there as if, after the pause in fighting, we will stop the war,” Netanyahu said. “We are at war and we will continue it until we achieve all the objectives. We will eliminate Hamas, return all the hostages and guarantee that there will be no element in Gaza that threatens Israel.”"

Sánchez, who was reelected last week to lead the country, unveiled the new Cabinet for his progressive coalition government on Monday. He substituted Belarra with Pablo Bustinduy.

Through her social media pages, Belarra has unequivocally called for an end to Israel’s horrendous war crimes in the besieged coastal strip and sought the intervention of the International Criminal Court (ICC).

In the latest post on X, formerly Twitter, she said the ICC has “finally opened an investigation into war crimes in Gaza,” hoping that the body “acts quickly and decisively” to end the Gaza genocide.

In an interview with Al Jazeera, she criticized “a deafening silence of so many countries and so many political leaders who could do something,” to end the war on Gaza.

“I speak about what I know well, which is the European Union. It seems the display of hypocrisy which the European Commission is showing is unacceptable.”

She also reiterated that the regime of Israel was committing “planned genocide against the Palestine people.”

“Why can we give lessons in human rights in other conflicts and not here when the world is watching in horror? “The deaths of thousands of children, the mothers desperately shouting because they are witnessing the killing of their children.”

Belarra called on Madrid and other EU countries to break diplomatic ties with Tel Aviv since the regime launched its relentless air and ground attacks against the besieged Palestinian territory, which have killed more than 13,300 people, including over 5,500 children, in six weeks.

The European Union and the United States have so far failed to publically denounce the regime’s grave violations against Palestinians.

The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas is to free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages taken in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel is to release some Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Egyptian state media say the truce will begin Thursday morning. Egypt helped mediate the cease-fire agreement, which would bring the first respite to war-weary Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before the Cabinet voted early Wednesday to back the agreement that the war would continue even if a deal was reached. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas.

ISRAEL RELEASES AWARD-WINNING PALESTINIAN POET WHO WAS DETAINED BY TROOPS IN GAZA

JERUSALEM — The Israeli army says it has released an award-winning Palestinian poet it detained in Gaza.

Mosab Abu Toha has been contributing pieces to western media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire picture of its toll on civilians through his personal experience.

His family announced Monday that Abu Toha had been arrested while evacuating to southern Gaza from his home in the hard-hit Jabaliya refugee camp.

Abu Toha last posted to X on Nov. 15, writing: “Alive. Thanks for your prayers.”

Diana Buttu, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and friend of the family, said Abu Toha was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint and held for two days with dozens of other Palestinians at an Israeli detention center. She says he was was accused of having Hamas connections and beaten up in custody.

“He was taken out of Gaza and he was interrogated,” she said.

She said he was released on Tuesday, apparently after the case attracted international attention.

The literary and free expression organization PEN said it was concerned about the arrest and demanded to know Abu Toha’s whereabouts and the reason for his arrest. The New Yorker magazine, to which Abu Toha has contributed multiple articles, called for his safe return.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that Abu Toha had been released. It gave no further details.

Buttu said Abu Toha was safe in central Gaza after receiving medical treatment. The poet, whose son is an American citizen, is trying to leave the besieged territory.

MASS GRAVE FOR OVER 100 PALESTINIANS DUG IN SOUTHERN GAZA

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — More than 100 bodies were buried Wednesday in a mass grave in Khan Younis, the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheets fastened with cable ties.

Medical workers placed dozens of bodies brought from various areas in northern Gaza, including Shifa Hospital, into a huge trench that was dug using a bulldozer.

Workers wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the bodies to the grave and performed funeral prayers.

GENEVA — International aid groups that have lined up thousands of aid trucks for Gaza say they’re ready to move quickly to send in food, water and other supplies if a pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel takes hold as hoped on Thursday.

Details remain unclear about both the mechanics of getting more aid for beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza and the possible release of hostages kidnapped from Israel whose families have desperately sought their release.

The aid groups say a key ambition will be to get help to northern Gaza, which has been largely inaccessible to humanitarian shipments and where nearly all hospitals have stopped working amid a blistering military campaign by Israeli forces.

“The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to the fine print of the announced deal.

Della Longa lamented “bottlenecks” that have confounded the deliveries of some humanitarian aid – though not nearly enough – into Gaza. He said IFRC hopes that a deal would include provisions to allow for a “faster track” of aid shipments.

The only route for international humanitarian aid into Gaza since Oct. 7 has been through the Rafah Crossing into Egypt, and planeloads of supplies have been flown into the nearby Egyptian city of El-Arish – and trucks have queued up near Gaza.

Intense Israeli inspections of trucks and cargo have slowed entry into Gaza.

IRANIAN-BACKED MILITANT GROUP VOWS TO EXPAND CONFLICT IF US AIRSTRIKES CONTINUE

WASHINGTON — A major Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq has warned it may strike additional U.S. targets after U.S. warplanes killed multiple militants in response to the first use of short-range ballistic missiles against U.S. forces at Al-Asad Air Base earlier this week.

U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and a Kataib Hezbollah command and control node south of Baghdad on Tuesday, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional sensitive details of the attacks.

There were Kataib Hezbollah personnel at both sites at the time of the strikes, but the officials said they could not yet confirm whether anyone there was killed.

Militia officials in Iraq said the attack had killed eight Kataib Hezbollah members.

Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday that it was considering “expanding the scope of targets” if the U.S. military continues with its strikes, adding that the attack “will not go unpunished.”

The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities on Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. The attacks have continued unabated since, with at least 66 rocket and missile attacks hitting U.S. facilities and wounding at least 62 service members.

SWISS PARLIAMENT TO CONSIDER BAN ON HAMAS

GENEVA — Switzerland’s executive branch said Wednesday it will ask parliament to ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The Federal Council said the government will also end contracts it has with three Palestinian non-governmental organizations. They were among 11 Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that had been under review by Swiss officials following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.

Four days after the deadly rampage in Israel, the council moved to designate Hamas as a terrorist group and instructed the Foreign Ministry to consider a possible ban.

The seven-member council, which includes the Swiss president, reiterated its condemnation of the attacks “in the strongest possible terms” and expressed its regret about the deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict.

The United States and the European Union, which does not count Switzerland as a member, have long considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on the international community to provide “timely and sustained humanitarian assistance” to the Palestinians in Gaza.

Modi was speaking at a virtual meeting of Group of 20 nations on Wednesday before India’s presidency ends on Nov. 30.

“We agree that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians anywhere is condemnable,” Modi said. “We welcome the news today concerning the release of the hostages. We hope that all the hostages will be released soon.”

Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war in Gaza — a breakthrough that will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and bring a large influx of aid to the besieged territory, officials said Wednesday.

“It is important to provide timely and sustained humanitarian assistance. It is also important to ensure that the war between Israel and Hamas does not take any regional form,” Modi said.

CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says the Israel-Hamas truce will take effect at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) Thursday.

Egypt helped mediate the four-day cease-fire, which will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The deal will also see the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israeli media also reported that the truce would begin Thursday at 10 a.m.

CAIRO — The World Health Organization has documented 178 attacks on healthcare facilities that killed 553 people, including 22 healthcare workers, since the war started on Oct. 7, the agency’s regional director said Wednesday.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari said in an online briefing that about 800 people, including 48 healthcare workers, were injured in the attacks, which damaged 24 hospitals and 32 ambulances.

The war has forced the shutdown of 27 out of 36 hospitals and 47 out of 72 primary health care clinics across Gaza, he said. The facilities stopping providing services mainly because of a lack of fuel and attacks, he said.

“Hospitals must be allowed to replenish the resources they need to continue functioning,” he said. “We cannot keep providing drops of aid in an ocean of needs.”

W.H.O. STAFF MEMBER, FAMILY ARE KILLED IN STRIKE

CAIRO — The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering.

It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers.

The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike.

Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.”

Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives.

WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.”

POPE BEGS FOR PEACE AND AN END TO ‘TERRORISM’

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.”

In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives in Gaza.

Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath.

Francis said: “Here we’ve gone beyond war. This isn’t war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.”

He also asked for God to help both Israeli and Palestinian people “resolve problems and not go forward with passions that are killing everyone in the end.”

Francis has spoken out repeatedly for an end to the war.

ISRAEL PUBLISHES LIST OF PALESTINIAN PRISONERS WHO COULD BE RELEASED UNDER HOSTAGE DEAL

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s Justice Ministry has published a list of 300 Palestinian detainees and prisoners who could potentially be released in a hostage deal.

Most of those on the list published Wednesday are teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses, including throwing rocks or alleged incitement. None was convicted of murder, though some served sentences for attempted murder.

The youngest detainee on the list is 14, and it also includes around 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

According to the truce-for-hostages deal announced Wednesday, 50 hostages will be released over four days, likely starting Thursday, during which fighting will pause.

After that, every additional 10 hostages released will result in one additional day in the pause and the release of additional Palestinian prisoners.

Israel is expected to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in the first four days, though the Ministry of Justice published the list of 300 in case the deal is extended. Under Israeli law, the public has 24 hours to object to any release.

CAIRO — The evacuation of patients trapped in Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has begun, the Palestinian Red Crescent says.

The charity said 14 ambulances arrived at the hospital on Wednesday, and the evacuation has been coordinated with the United Nations and Doctors without Borders medical group.

Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, has said there were over 250 patients at the facility, which was besieged by the Israeli military earlier this month. Over 400 displaced people sheltering in the facility have also been trapped there, he said.

Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital, the largest in Gaza, to conduct militant operations. Hamas and health officials have denied the allegation.

Over the weekend, the World Health Organization coordinated the evacuation of 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza. Of them, 28 babies were later transferred to Egypt.

EU OFFICIAL SAYS HALT IN FIGHTING MUST BE USED TO FLOOD GAZA WITH AID

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s crisis management chief has welcomed the Israeli hostage release agreement and says the halt in fighting that is part of the deal must be used to flood Gaza with desperately needed aid.

“We hope that the agreement on a pause of hostilities that has just been reached will allow for a substantial surge in humanitarian aid delivery into and within Gaza,” Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic said Wednesday.

“We certainly hope that this will not be a one-off,” he told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, and called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses throughout Gaza.”

The 27-nation EU is the world’s biggest aid donor to the Palestinians. Lenarcic said 15 EU aid cargo flights have been sent, with most of that aid already in Gaza, and that more is on the way.

The bloc insists that more trucks must be allowed through the Rafah crossing point with Egypt and other corridors opened.

Lenarcic said getting into Gaza is “extremely challenging” and that fewer than 50 trucks a day make it through, a number which he described as “woefully inadequate.” He welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some fuel in, but said it only covers about one third of Gaza’s basic needs.

BRITAIN URGES BOTH SIDES TO ENSURE HOSTAGE AGREEMENT IS ‘DELIVERED IN FULL’

LONDON — The British government has welcomed an agreement to release some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza and urged all parties to ensure it is “delivered in full.”

Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the agreement was “a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

“This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis,” he said. “The U.K. will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.”

CHINA SAYS IT HOPES TRUCE AGREEMENT WILL EASE TENSIONS

BEIJING — The Chinese government says it welcomes the four-day truce reached between Israel and Hamas.

“We welcome the provisional truce reached by the parties concerned and hope it will help to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, de-escalate the conflict and ease tensions,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.

China has been calling for a cease-fire and refrained from criticizing the initial Hamas attack on Israel that started the latest conflict. A delegation of foreign ministers from Arab nations and Indonesia held talks with China’s foreign minister this week as they started a tour to press their case for a cease-fire with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.

RUSSIA SAYS TRUCE IS A STEP TOWARD ENDING HOSTILITIES

MOSCOW — The Kremlin on Wednesday hailed a deal between Israel and Hamas for a halt to the war and the release of hostages as step toward ending the hostilities.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the announcement of the deal was “the first good news from Gaza in a long time.”

Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he noted that Russia along with most other countries had called for a truce and humanitarian pauses, adding that “only on the basis of such pauses future attempts to find a lasting settlement to the problem could be made.”

FRANCE HOPEFUL ITS NATIONALS WILL BE AMONG THE FIRST RELEASED UNDER DEAL

PARIS — France’s foreign minister says she’s hopeful that French nationals will be among the first hostages released as part of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas.

“We hope that French nationals are among them and even, if possible, among the first group that will be released,” the minister, Catherine Colonna, said Wednesday on France Inter radio. “We are working for that.”

France counts eight people missing, some of them confirmed as hostages, from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants that ignited their latest and deadliest war. France also counts 40 killed in the attack. Colonna said that not all the hostages taken on Oct. 7 were captured by Hamas. But she said that in the course of negotiations, the militant group has said that “it could assemble together all of the hostages.”

In a message on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said “we are working tirelessly to ensure that all hostages are released.” He also hoped the truce will “enable aid to be brought in” and help the Gaza people.

TURKEY SAYS IT HOPES TRUCE WILL LEAD TO A LASTING PEACE

ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey, a vocal critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza, welcomed the four-day truce as a “positive development to prevent more bloodshed.”

A Foreign Ministry statement released Wednesday said Turkey expects full compliance with the agreement.

“We hope that the humanitarian pause will help permanently end the current conflict as soon as possible and initiate a process towards a just and lasting peace based on a two-state solution,” it said.

US STRIKES BACK AT IRAN-BACKED MILITANTS IN IRAQ

BAGHDAD — The United States military said Wednesday that it has carried out strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have launched attacks on U.S. forces.

The U.S. Central Command said in a statement Wednesday that its forces had “conducted discrete, precision strikes against two facilities in Iraq … in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups,” including one on Tuesday involving the use of close-range ballistic missiles.

Two officials with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said the strikes hit three locations in the area of Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad, killing eight members of the Kataeb Hezbollah militant group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Iranian-backed militants have launched dozens of attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. While most of the more than five dozen attacks have been ineffective, at least 60 U.S. personnel have reported minor injuries. The militant groups have said the strikes are in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

ROME — Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted a town hall meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday, booing and heckling him when he addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The protesters chanted “Shame on you” and accused Kristersson of supporting genocide after he said Sweden condemns Hamas and supports Israel’s right to self-defense. Police removed some of them from the venue in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second biggest city.

Kristersson criticized the protesters in a Facebook post after the event.

“When we met tonight with a few hundred Gothenburgers the meeting was disrupted by a screaming and shouting group of people who refused to respect everyone else who had come to ask questions,” he wrote. “These political saboteurs appeared to have come to our question-and-answer session only to shout out their anger over Sweden and the EU’s political position about the conflict in the Middle East -– they were particularly disappointed over the condemnation of the terror organization Hamas.”

Kristersson’s center-right government has strongly sided with Israel in the Gaza conflict, condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and supporting Israel’s right to self-defense. Pro-Palestinian groups and the left-leaning opposition have accused the government of ignoring the plight of Palestinian civilians.

1141935325,20231122,"In the face of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the U.S.’s unwavering moral support for Israel’s military response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack is angering the international community — including close allies.

The Biden administration has refused to heed growing calls for a total ceasefire amid tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties and devastating conditions in the besieged enclave. This has prompted accusations of double standards, threatening the U.S.‘s grip on power in the Global South and the Middle East.

“We look forward to a stronger role on the part of great powers such as China in order to stop the attacks against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,” Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry told his Chinese counterpart during a visit to Beijing, where a delegation of Arab and Muslim leaders pushed for an end to hostilities in Gaza after failed negotiations with the West.

“Unfortunately, there are major countries that give cover to the current Israeli attacks,” he added.

“The Biden administration has done things no other administration has by giving gifts to a Netanyahu government that has been more far right than ever,” Yousef Munayyer, head of the Arab Center’s Palestine/Israel Program, told Semafor. Unlike former U.S. President Barack Obama, Biden has especially tempered his tone with Israel and taken a less critical stance on the Israel-Palestine issue. The U.S’s historically close-knit relationship with the Jewish state also puts it in a “very difficult position” on the world stage, Munayyer said, as there are inevitable constraints to what the U.S. can publicly say and do. This has led Arab leaders to engage with countries like China instead, who they view as a “refreshing alternative” to the West. “The Chinese are not beholden to the pro-Israel orthodoxy,” Munayyer said.

The Arab world’s perception of “American complicity in the carnage in Gaza” will weaken the U.S. in its competition with China which, unlike the U.S., has championed the Palestinian cause despite its own record of human rights violations, Tuqa Nusairat, a Middle East expert from the Atlantic Council, writes for the L.A. Times. Those in the Arab world and Global South have pointed out the double standards in past American statements about “respect for human rights” and international laws of war, when it comes to the U.S. response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Every U.S.-made missile dropped on Gaza’s besieged population along with America’s tepid response to the war will damage U.S. standing in the region and around the world for years to come,” Nusairat writes.

The U.S. is also losing credibility with developing nations who view its inaction towards Israel’s campaign in Gaza as hypocritical — particularly in comparison to its stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration’s decision to veto a United Nations resolution for a “humanitarian pause” in Gaza this October sparked outrage, with one African diplomat telling Reuters that “the veto told us that Ukrainian lives are more valuable than Palestinian ones.” Even the European Union’s inconsistency over its support for Ukrainians, but not for Palestinians, is “geopolitical kryptonite,” the Financial Times’ Brussels bureau chief wrote.

Domestically too, Biden’s position is being challenged by progressive Democrats. In a recent poll, the U.S. president’s national approval rating dropped to an all-time low of 40% with a majority of voters disapproving of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Sen. Bernie Sanders recently proposed that Congress require U.S. military aid to Israel to be “conditional,” while a group of Democratic senators wrote to Biden calling for increased protection of civilians in Gaza. “We are concerned that increased and prolonged suffering in Gaza is not only intolerable for Palestinian civilians there but will also negatively impact the security of Israeli civilians by exacerbating existing tensions and eroding regional alliances,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter."
1141940033,20231122,"France ""is pushing for sanctions at the European level against senior Hamas figures, individually, because for the moment ... the European Union only condemns the organisation as a whole,"" Laurence Boone, secretary of state for European affairs, told AFP on the sidelines of an international meeting in Madrid.

The idea would be to ""specifically target certain individuals"" with ""mainly financial"" sanctions such as an asset freeze, she added without specifying who should be targeted.

READ | US issues second round of sanctions on Hamas, members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard

France also wants EU sanctions slapped on people linked to Hamas and its ally, Lebanon's pro-Iran Hezbollah, like the sanctions the bloc has imposed on some Iranians over their role in the war in Ukraine.

The EU in February imposed sanctions on seven Iranian firms which make drones used by Russia to strike targets in Ukraine.

France's proposal could be adopted by EU foreign ministers in December, Boone said. It has the backing of Germany and Italy, according to her entourage.

The United States in October imposed sanctions against 10 ""key"" members of Hamas based in Gaza, Sudan, Turkey, Algeria and Qatar who are involved in financing the group's activities.

Israel has bombarded the Gaza Strip following the October 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people. The group took 239 hostages.

1141940035,20231122,"Helsinki accuses Moscow of weaponising desperate refugees and migrants in retaliation for its recent entry into NATO.

Finland has announced it will close all but one of its border crossings with Russia after a rise in the arrivals of refugees and migrants whom the government claims Moscow is intentionally pushing to the country’s frontiers.

Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Wednesday that as of the end of Friday, only its northernmost border crossing with Russia, Raja-Jooseppi, will remain open.

Finland had already shut four of its eastern border checkpoints last week and is set to close three of the four remaining crossing points.

“Raja-Jooseppi is the northernmost [border crossing], and it requires a real effort to get there,” Orpo said at a press conference.

More than 600 asylum seekers have entered Finland via Russia in November, compared with only a few dozen in September and October. They were mostly from countries such as Yemen, Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria, according to border officials. Most were young men in their 20s, but some were families with children, border guard data and photos from news outlets showed.

Officials also said Finnish border guards and soldiers have begun erecting barriers, including concrete obstacles topped with barbed wire, at some of the crossing points.

After the recent closures, arrivals shifted north along the countries’ 1,340km (832-mile) border to Vartius and Salla, two border stations that still accepted asylum applications, Finland said.

“Undoubtedly Russia is instrumentalising migrants” as part of its “hybrid warfare” against Finland, Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said on Wednesday.

Moscow has denied it is funneling desperate migrants and refugees to the Finnish border.

Finland joined NATO in April after decades of military non-alignment and pragmatic friendly relations with Moscow. Its border with Russia serves as the European Union’s external border and makes up NATO’s northeastern flank.

Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Russian authorities are ready to work together with Finnish officials to reach an agreement on the border issue. Finland should have “put forward its concerns to work out a mutually acceptable solution or receive explanation”, she argued.

On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the Finnish ambassador in Moscow to lodge a formal protest over the closure of the most used checkpoints on the border.

About 30 to 70 refugees and migrants are arriving each day at the Vartius checkpoint in Kainuu and the Salla checkpoint in Finland’s Arctic Lapland region, where winter conditions have meant temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) and plenty of snow.

Andrei Chibis, governor of northern Russia’s Murmansk region, which borders Finland, on Wednesday posted pictures of migrants in a tent near the Salla checkpoint set up by the regional authorities to let them warm themselves up, eat and drink hot tea.

He described the situation as a “humanitarian crisis” and blasted the Finnish authorities, saying “foreign citizens can’t cross the border” to the Finnish side.

“At the EU border with Finland, Russian border guards have been letting people through without Schengen visas or EU residence permits. People who are being misled. People who are being used by Russia,” EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said on Tuesday.

“The Finnish border is the EU’s border. The European Union is behind you,” Johanssen said, adding that Finland has requested additional operational support from Frontex, the EU’s border agency, and up to 60 officers.

In 2011, 3,000 to 4,000 asylum seekers became stranded in no-man’s land on the border between Poland and Belarus as Warsaw deployed security forces to stop migrants and refugees from entering at a time of freezing winter temperatures and lack of access to vital supplies and medical care.

Lithuania and Latvia also reported sharp increases in the number of people trying to cross their borders at the time.

The EU accused Minsk of deliberately enticing migrants and refugees to Belarus and then funnelling them westwards with promises of easy entry into the bloc as part of a “hybrid attack” on its member states in retaliation for sanctions. Warsaw accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of masterminding the crisis.

Both Belarus and Russia denied the allegations.

Human rights groups accused Poland of conducting illegal pushbacks at its border and raised concerns for the wellbeing of the stranded refugees and migrants."
1141940038,20231122,
1141942155,20231122,"NEW YORK (AP) — It’s been quite a week for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — and co-founder Sam Altman.

Altman, who helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research lab back in 2015, was removed as CEO Friday in a sudden and mostly unexplained exit that stunned the industry. And while his chief executive title was swiftly reinstated just days later, a lot of questions are still up in the air.

If you’re just catching up on the OpenAI saga and what’s at stake for the artificial intelligence space as a whole, you’ve come to the right place. Here’s a rundown of what you need to know.

WHO IS SAM ALTMAN AND HOW DID HE RISE TO FAME?

Altman is co-founder of OpenAI, the San Francisco-based company behind ChatGPT (yes, the chatbot that’s seemingly everywhere today — from schools to health care ).

The explosion of ChatGPT since its arrival one year ago propelled Altman into the spotlight of the rapid commercialization of generative AI — which can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. And as he became Silicon Valley’s most sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of this technology, Altman helped transform OpenAI into a world-renowned startup.

But his position at OpenAI hit some rocky turns in a whirlwind that was the past week. Altman was fired as CEO Friday — and days later, he was back on the job with a new board of directors.

Within that time, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has rights to its existing technology, helped drive Altman’s return, quickly hiring him as well as another OpenAI co-founder and former president, Greg Brockman, who quit in protest after the CEO’s ousting. Meanwhile, hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to resign.

Both Altman and Brockman celebrated their returns to the company in posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, early Wednesday.

WHY DOES HIS REMOVAL — AND REINSTATEMENT — MATTER?

There’s a lot that remains unknown about Altman’s initial ousting. Friday’s announcement said he was “not consistently candid in his communications” with the then-board of directors, which refused to provide more specific details.

Regardless, the news sent shockwaves throughout the AI world — and, because OpenAI and Altman are such leading players in this space, may raise trust concerns around a burgeoning technology that many people still have questions about.

“The OpenAI episode shows how fragile the AI ecosystem is right now, including addressing AI’s risks,” said Johann Laux, an expert at the Oxford Internet Institute focusing on human oversight of artificial intelligence.

The turmoil also accentuated the differences between Altman and members of the company’s previous board, who have expressed various views on the safety risks posed by AI as the technology advances.

Multiple experts add that this drama highlights how it should be governments — and not big tech companies — that should be calling the shots on AI regulation, particularly for fast-evolving technologies like generative AI.

“The events of the last few days have not only jeopardized OpenAI’s attempt to introduce more ethical corporate governance in the management of their company, but it also shows that corporate governance alone, even when well-intended, can easily end up cannibalized by other corporate’s dynamics and interests,” said Enza Iannopollo, principal analyst at Forrester.

The lesson, Iannopollo said, is that companies can’t alone deliver the level of safety and trust in AI that society needs. “Rules and guardrails, designed with companies and enforced by regulators with rigor, are crucial if we are to benefit from AI,” he added.

WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI? HOW IS IT BEING REGULATED?

Unlike traditional AI, which processes data and completes tasks using predetermined rules, generative AI (including chatbots like ChatGPT) can create something new.

Tech companies are still leading the show when it comes to governing AI and its risks, while governments around the world work to catch up.

In the European Union, negotiators are putting the final touches on what’s expected to be the world’s first comprehensive AI regulations. But they’ve reportedly been bogged down over whether and how to include the most contentious and revolutionary AI products, the commercialized large-language models that underpin generative AI systems including ChatGPT.

Chatbots were barely mentioned when Brussels first laid out its initial draft legislation in 2021, which focused on AI with specific uses. But officials have been racing to figure out how to incorporate these systems, also known as foundation models, into the final version.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., President Joe Biden signed an ambitious executive order last month seeking to balance the needs of cutting-edge technology companies with national security and consumer rights.

The order — which will likely need to be augmented by congressional action — is an initial step that is meant to ensure that AI is trustworthy and helpful, rather than deceptive and destructive. It seeks to steer how AI is developed so that companies can profit without putting public safety in jeopardy."

Network Rail intends to procure a framework for Reactive and Small Scheme works covering its building and civil assets within the Eastern Region. The types of works to be procured under the framework will be reactive works and small schemes that are of low complexity. Such works predominately impact the operation of the railway and will cover the following categories of works:

The Reactive and Small Schemes framework is envisaged to be the Eastern Region’s route to market to deliver such projects and requirements under NR’s Strategic Business Plan during CP7.

The framework will be lotted as outlined below covering the geographical scope of the Eastern Region (https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/our-regions/eastern/):

To ensure supply chain resilience NR will retain the flexibility to allow Suppliers to work across Lots but only restricted to their specific discipline. This will only apply in instances where it has been deemed by NR that Suppliers within the relevant Lot under the same discipline cannot fulfil Network Rail’s requirement(s).

The initial term of the framework is 5 years with the option to extend for a further two periods of one year each.

The indicative values provided for each of the Lots are estimates only, these are based on CP7 Strategic Business Plan budgets rather than delivery plan values. As such, they are not guaranteed and do not act as a minimum or maximum workbank value for the control period or a volume guarantee.

The maximum value of the framework exceeds the combined value of the lots, this is so as the value is inclusive of the estimated values of optional extensions for the framework.

1141944244,20231122,"The EU says development aid for the Palestinian territories was not misappropriated.The bloc will continue supporting humanitarian efforts in the region.

The European Union announced a review of its development aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip immediately after Hamasterrorists attacked Israel on October 7. After a European Commission meeting in Strasbourg, a decision has now been reached to continue providing development aid. There are no indications that Hamas — deemed a terrorist organization by the EU, the US and others — misappropriated EU funds.

European Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi said that the audit of this year's payments had not revealed a misuse of funds and that the EU could continue cooperating with various agencies and authorities in the Palestinian territories.

After the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, Varhelyi had initially wanted to stop all payments. This, however, had angered the EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell. Consequently, an agreement was reached to audit previous payments.

Since then, 119 development aid contracts worth €330 million ($358 million) have been reviewed. Non-governmental organizations have been requested to answers additional question with regard to 51 of these contracts. The European Commission has said that seven contracts regarding infrastructure in the Gaza Strip have been suspended due to the ongoing conflict. The EU had earmarked a total of €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) in development aid for the Palestinian territories for the period 2020 to 2024.

The German government had also said that it would review its development aid to the Palestinian territories. On the sidelines of a meeting of foreign affairs and development ministers in Brussels, Germany's state secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development Jochen Flasbarth said that the government had so far audited development projects in Gaza and Jordan. He added that Germany would continue its cooperation with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

""The review of other areas is still ongoing, but should be completed soon,"" Flasbarth said in reference to the West Bank, which is occupied by Israel and governed by the Palestinian Authority.

It was right to carefully vet all funding programs in light of the serious situation, Flasbarth added. ""We have found nothing unusual and have heard from other states that have chosen a similar path that they have also carried out checks and found everything to be above board.""

Varhelyi wants to make future development aid conditional on tougher checks. Going forward, there will be checks to see whether aid organizations have made ""inflammatory"" or antisemitic remarks. There are also plans to check whether families seeking EU welfare payouts for example have engaged in hate speech. So far, this rule only applied to the head of the families in need.

But not everyone agrees with these stricter rules. Some European commissioners at the meeting in Strasbourg said they considered the restrictions exaggerated and unjustified.

Some of the EU funds go towards paying the salaries of Palestinian Authority officials in the West Bank. They also indirectly provide social aid to Gazan families via aid organizations. The EU severed all direct contact with Hamas in 2007.

Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization, with which the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Protestant aid agency Brot für die Welt (Bread for the World) used to cooperate, will no longer receive funds. A spokesperson for the ministry recently said that organizations that supported armed resistance to Israel were not appropriate partners.

Direct humanitarian aid provided to the Palestinians in the form of food, shelter and medical care, which is distinct from development projects, remains unaffected and the EU is planning to extend this. After the start of Israel's offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the bloc would quadruple aid to €100 million ($108 million).

EU member states have granted a further €260 million in urgently needed humanitarian assistance, of which €160 million will be paid for by Germany, according to German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.

The bloc will also continue to provide funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) , which has been operating in the region for decades and supporting people in the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Two thirds of Gazan were already dependent on UNRWA assistance even before the current war between the Israeli army and Hamas erupted. The UN agency has 13,000 employees in Gaza.

Last year, UNRWA's largest donors were the US, which supplied $343 million (€315 million), followed by Germany with $202 million (€185 million) and the EU with $114 million (€105 million). The UNRWA budget totaled $1.17 billion (€1 billion) in 2022.

Meanwhile, Belgian Minister of Development Cooperation Caroline Gennez has called for fighting to stop in Gaza, saying that short pauses as proposed by the EU in October are not adequate. ""I think it is very clear that the violence should end now,"" she said. ""There have been too many innocent victims in Gaza and still too many Israeli hostages taken. It is important that the violence stops and humanitarian aid is secured and that one day we start negotiations for a durable tenable two-state-solution.""

France, too, has called for an end to the hostilities.

1141944247,20231122,
1141949931,20231122,"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will be allowed to visit hostages held by Hamas in Gaza as part of Israel’s temporary ceasefire agreement with the terror group, Benjamin Netanyahu has said.

Fifty of the 240 hostages kept captive by Hamas are expected to be released over a four-day period under the deal, in exchange for the freeing of 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.

There will also be a pause in fighting, which is expected to start tomorrow at 10am.

Mr Netanyahu said that the deal allows for representatives of the ICRC to tend to those who will continue to be held in Gaza.

“I expect the Red Cross to do its job, and to visit them all and to bring them the medication that they need,” he said during a press conference on Wednesday evening.

The ICRC has not yet confirmed Mr Netanyahu’s claim but had earlier said it was ready to facilitate the release of the hostages.

The hostages are expected to be transported to Israel through Egypt, the only other country to share a border with the Gaza Strip.

Thank you for following our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict. The key developments from the day were the following:
• None The process of recovering 50 Israeli hostages is due to begin tomorrow, and the four-day ceasefire is expected to start at 10am.
• None Israel will not notify the families of hostages due to be released by Hamas until they are out of Gaza.
• None The White House hopes several hundred more aid trucks carrying food, water and medicine will reach Gaza in the coming days, amid the conflict with Israel, national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday.
• None Israel’s Supreme Court has rejected a legal challenge to the hostage deal, which will also see 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails released.
• None The head of the United Nations children’s agency has called the besieged Gaza Strip “the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.”



Israel will not notify the families of hostages due to be released by Hamas until they are out of Gaza, a senior Israeli official has said.

The decision has been taken amid concerns that Hamas may not free the specific hostages it committed to release under the deal reached on Wednesday, the Times of Israel reported, citing the unnamed official.

The agreement – which will see a four-day pause in fighting, and 50 Israeli hostages released in batches in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails – will take effect from 10am tomorrow.

After being returned to Israel, the hostages will be immediately flown to hospitals, the official said.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has said it is ready to facilitate the release of the hostages.

They are expected to be transported to Israel through Egypt, the only other country to share a border with the Gaza Strip.

Netanyahu says hostage deal does not include 'release of murderers'

The hostage deal does not include the “release of murderers,” Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday, according to CNN.

Most Israelis have welcomed the agreement, but there has been concern from some that perpetrators of fatal attacks on Israelis could be among the list of Palestinians set to be released as part of the trade.

White House hopes hundreds of aid trucks will reach Gaza in coming days

The White House hopes several hundred more aid trucks carrying food, water and medicine will reach Gaza in the coming days, amid the conflict with Israel, national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday.

Yoav Gallant, Israeli defence minister, has told a press conference that Israel is “slowly but surely” dismantling the military framework of Hamas.

The defence minister said he recommended to the Israeli parliament that the armed forces should go further into Gaza – to show Hamas the powers of Israel’s military and rescue hostages.

He says that he “sincerely” hopes that the hostage release agreement “will be actually executed”.

Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking now live on TV at a press conference to talk about the hostage deal.

He also said he is still working to get an agreement to release “all, and I mean all” hostages held by Hamas.

Discussing his conversations with the families of the hostages, he said: “I heard about the constant fear…the constant terror, the suffering and …anxiety,” he said.

He also said the Red Cross will be allowed to visit the remaining hostages in Gaza.

Israeli military reiterates it is still at war with Hamas

Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, has reiterated that the planned upcoming ceasefire is “an operational pause” only.

“Israel is still at war with Hamas,” Hagari told a news conference on Tuesday evening. He said that the IDF was committed to bringing every hostage home.

“The Hamas massacre of October 7 was a genocidal attack,” Hagari said.

Biden calls Qatari emir to thank him for mediation

US President Joe Biden called Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to thank him for mediation between Israel and Hamas that resulted in a truce, the emir’s press office said on Wednesday.

Yemen’s Houthis have launched a number of missiles towards military posts in Israel’s Eilat, the group’s spokesman said in a post on X on Wednesday, which was reported by Reuters.

Israel’s Supreme Court has rejected a legal challenge to the hostage deal.

The Almagor association, which was set up in 1986 to represent victims of terror, had claimed that the government’s decision, intensified the risk of “the recurrence of serious acts of terrorism to which all the citizens and residents of the country are exposed.”

Almagor had asked the Supreme Court to “annul the government’s decision … [and] order [the government] to discuss again the terms of the deal with Hamas,” according to information released by the Court.

The Court said it rejected the petition outright on the grounds that the hostage deal “is a clear political issue to which this court does not consider its involvement as necessary.”

France wants the European Union to impose sanctions against top Hamas leaders, a senior French official said Wednesday.

France “is pushing for sanctions at the European level against senior Hamas figures, individually, because for the moment ... the European Union only condemns the organisation as a whole,” Laurence Boone, secretary of state for European affairs, told AFP on the sidelines of an international meeting in Madrid.

The idea would be to “specifically target certain individuals” with “mainly financial” sanctions such as an asset freeze, she added without specifying who should be targeted.

The Swiss government has decided to draft a law explicitly banning Hamas activities or support for the Palestinian terror group.

“The ban has the sole aim of preventing the terrorist activities of this organisation, and the people who support them,” Justice Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider told a press conference.

She said banning Hamas would make it easier to expel “dangerous people” and speed up criminal proceedings against “potential terrorists”.

The act, to be drafted by the end of February, is aimed at giving Swiss authorities the tools to counter Hamas activities or support for the group within Switzerland, AFP reported.

Netanyahu and members of war cabinet to hold news conference Wednesday

Benjamin Netanyahu and members of the war cabinet will hold a news conference at 7:15 pm (9:15 pm local time) Wednesday in Tel Aviv, according to the prime minister’s office.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who are members of the emergency war cabinet, are expected to be among those at the conference.

Humanitarian and human rights organisations have said a four-day truce in the Israel-Hamas war was too short and called for more time to deliver vital aid to the Gaza Strip.

Paul O’Brien, from Amnesty International USA, said on a conference call of major non-governmental organisations that the four-day truce was “not enough and it’s certainly not enough in human rights terms”.

A dispute has broken out over whether Pope Francis used the word “genocide” to describe events in Gaza, with Palestinians who met with him insisting that he did and the Vatican saying he did not, Reuters has reported.

The opposing versions emerged at an afternoon press conference with 10 Palestinians who met the Pope on Wednesday morning at his Vatican residence. That meeting followed a separate one with Israeli relatives of hostages in Gaza.

“When we shared the stories of the families that have been killed (in Gaza) he mentioned ‘I see the genocide’,” said Shireen Awwad Hilal, who teaches at the Bethlehem Bible College.

“It was very clear, the word genocide did not come from us. It came from His Holiness, Pope Francis,” she said.

But a statement sent by Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni, in response to a question texted by a reporter, said the opposite.

“I am not aware that he (the Pope) used such a word. He used terms that he expressed during the general audience and words that in any case represent the terrible situation that is being lived out in Gaza,” Bruni’s statement said.

UN says Gaza world's 'most dangerous place' for children

The head of the United Nations children’s agency has called the besieged Gaza Strip “the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.”

UNICEF’s executive director Catherine Russell said over 5,300 children have reportedly been killed in Gaza since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel, accounting for 40 percent of the deaths.

“This is unprecedented,” saidMs Russell, who had just returned from a trip to southern Gaza. “I am haunted by what I saw and heard.”

British foreign minister David Cameron has met his counterparts from Arab and Islamic countries in London to discuss the Israel-Hamas conflict.

“We discussed how to use this step forward to think about the future and how we can build a peaceful future which provides security for Israel but also peace and stability for the Palestinian people”, Cameron said in a statement.

Foreign Ministers from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Indonesia and Nigeria, as well as the Secretary General of the League of Arab States and Ambassador of Qatar attended the meeting, Britain said.

The Israeli military has said it intercepted a cruise missile fired towards the south of the country.

After reports of “an infiltration by a hostile aircraft” near the southern Red Sea resort of Eilat, an Israeli fighter jet “successfully intercepted a cruise missile that was launched toward Israel”, it said in a statement.

“No infiltration into Israeli territory was identified,” the military added.

Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who have declared themselves part of the “axis of resistance” of Iran’s allies and proxies, have fired a series of drones and missiles towards Israel since the Gaza war erupted on October 7.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has welcomed the four-day agreement and said he hoped the deal would bolster efforts to achieve an outright end to the conflict.

Mr Ramaphosa has been one of the most prominent voices on the African continent on the brutal war between Israel and Hamas.

South Africa’s strong support for Palestinians dates back to former President Nelson Mandela’s days, with the country likening their plight to its own before the end of apartheid in 1994. Israel rejects the comparison.

“It is my hope that the achievement of this pause will strengthen efforts to achieve an outright end to the current conflict,” Mr Ramaphosa said in a statement, reported by Reuters.

He said there needed to be a durable political resolution in the Middle East.

Saudi’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, was cautious in response to the Israel-Hamas deal.

“It’s good news.. but only one step in the right direction,” he said, speaking at a press conference in London.

He added: “We hope it can be a basis for extended pauses which lead to a ceasefire.”

Speaking at a news conference, he said they had been “tasked to convey a message to the world – the violence in Gaza must stop immediately”, the BBC reported.

The Israeli military on Wednesday said it intercepted a cruise missile fired towards the south of the country.

After reports of “an infiltration by a hostile aircraft” near the southern Red Sea resort of Eilat, an Israeli fighter jet “successfully intercepted a cruise missile that was launched toward Israel”, it said in a statement.

Gaza has evacuated 284 patients to Egypt since Israel launched attacks on the enclave following the October 7 massacre, according to Egyptian government press office director Ayman Walash.

He added that 2,222 tons of medical aid had been delivered via the Rafah crossing, as well as 6,063 tons of food, 4,625 tons of water, and 1,407 tons of other aid.

Since November 21, 378 tons of fuel have been delivered.

The Swiss government announced Wednesday it would bring forward a draft law by the end of February explicitly banning Hamas activities or support for the Palestinian militant group within Switzerland.

“The Federal Council decided to draft a federal act banning Hamas, considering this to be the most appropriate response to the situation that has prevailed in the Middle East since October 7,” the government said in a statement.

“The act will provide the federal authorities with the necessary tools to counter any Hamas activities or support for the organisation in Switzerland.”

The Swiss government also called for respect for international humanitarian law and particularly the protection of civilians in Gaza.

Hostage exchange to be repeated later this month

The Israel-Hamas deal agreed on Wednesday for the freeing of 50 hostages held in Gaza in exchange for the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners will be repeated later this month, a Palestinian official told Reuters.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that would mean a total release of 100 of the around 240 people Hamas seized on October 7.

In return, Israel would free a total of 300 Palestinian prisoners in the two exchanges - a number corresponding to a list of women and teenaged male inmates it published on Wednesday as candidates.

“The second batch will follow the first batch. They would need four or five days to organise it will involve 50 Israeli (hostages) in return for 150 Palestinian (prisoners),” the Palestinian official said. He said the prisoners would include elderly, women and children and the conditions will be the same.

Israeli officials did not immediately confirm this. But Israel has offered, in a cabinet statement, to extend the pause by a day for every additional 10 hostages handed over by Hamas.

Jeremy Hunt expressed his “horror” in parliament today at the October 7 massacre and loss of life on both sides since then.

The chancellor also announced additional funds to fight antisemitism.

“I am deeply concerned about the rise of antisemitism in our country, so I am announcing up to £7m over the next three years for organisations like the Holocaust Educational Trust to tackle antisemitism in schools and universities.

“I will also repeat the £3m uplift to the Community Security Trust. When it comes to antisemitism and all forms of racism, we must never allow the clock to be turned back.”

Syria's two main airports still shut month after Israeli strikes

Syria’s two main airports are still shut a month after simultaneous Israeli strikes put them out of service - the longest such closure since the Syrian conflict began, a war monitor said Wednesday.

Flights to and from Damascus and Aleppo airports have been suspended since the October 22 strikes damaged the runways.

Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said both airports “are closed” despite the completion of repair works.

Syrian authorities did not respond to an AFP request for comment on the extended closures.

Since Syria’s conflict began in 2011 after the government repressed pro-democracy protests, Israel has repeatedly targeted Damascus airport, but this is the first time the country’s main such facility has been shut for a month, Abdel Rahman added.

IDF will implement 'operational pause' rather than ceasefire

The Israeli Defence Forces will be implementing an “operational pause” rather than a ceasefire, a spokesperson has said.

“Our terminology is not ceasefire, our terminology is an operational pause,” Lt Col Richard Hecht, the IDF’s international spokesperson, told a briefing.

He added that the IDF was still waiting on the final details of the agreement and that he could not confirm when the fighting would stop or how it would operate.

“We still haven’t got the nitty gritty of this framework,” he said.

“We still have probably, maybe a day-plus before this thing matures, and things can happen in that day. And I assume today is going to be a day of fighting in Gaza.”

The Syrian Army has accused Israel of launching aerial strikes on outposts in the vicinity of Damascus.

Syrian state television said the country’s air defences shot down one of two missiles launched from the Golan Heights.

There were no casualties or damage, the Syrian Army added.

The Maldives could ban Israeli tourists from visiting the tropical Indian Ocean island.

An MP in the Muslim-majority country has proposed a bill that would stop holidaymakers from Israel visiting.

The two countries have never had diplomatic relations.

The SNP urged the Prime Minister to call for a permanent ceasefire in the Middle East now that a humanitarian pause had been brokered.

SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn told the Commons: “I think all of us in the chamber are united in our relief at reports that hostages are due to be release by Hamas in Gaza, but we can’t afford to lose sight of what comes at the other side of the temporary pause in hostilities that we are about to see.

“At the end of four days do we simply see the return to the killing of children in Gaza every 10 minutes?

“Or do we choose in this House to instead back a permanent ceasefire?”

Rishi Sunak replied: “Of course we want to see all hostages released as quickly as possible, including British nationals, and I would urge all parties involved to deliver the agreement in full.”

The Prime Minister thanked Qatar for its role in the negotiations, and said the UK would “maximise the opportunity of this temporary pause to step up aid to suffering civilians in Gaza”.

Rishi Sunak welcomed the humanitarian paused agreed in the Israel-Hamas conflict as a “crucial step towards ending the nightmare” for the families of those taken hostage.

The Prime Minister told the Commons: “We welcome the agreement reached overnight for a humanitarian pause in Gaza.

“This is something that we have consistently pushed for and is a crucial steps towards ending the nightmare for families of those taken hostage in Hamas’s terror attack and also addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

The United Nations on Wednesday welcomed the deal between Israel and Hamas, but said much more needed to be done.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres “welcomes the agreement reached by Israel and Hamas, with the mediation of Qatar supported by Egypt and the United States”, a spokesman for Guterres said in a statement.

“This is an important step in the right direction, but much more needs to be done,” they added.

Eight killed in US airstrike in Iraq

At least eight pro-Iranian fighters were killed by US strikes in Iraq today, according to the Iraqi group.

The United States said the strikes were in response to attacks on their troops.

The Hezbollah Brigades, a pro-Iran group within Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi, said that the US bombardment “left eight martyrs” and “will not go unpunished”.

Ceasefire to begin at 10am tomorrow, according to reports

A temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is expected to begin tomorrow at 10am local time (8am GMT), according to Hamas officials.

More than 1,000 wounded arrive at Kamal Adwan hospital overnight

More than 60 dead and 1,000 wounded people have arrived at Kamal Adwan hospital since last night, the hospital’s director has claimed.

The reports have not been independently verified.

Israeli troops have been photographed displaying the flag of the Israel Border Police inside of Gaza.

Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who yesterday cautioned against Israel striking any deal with Hamas, shared the imagine on X.

He wrote: “The flag of the Border Guard is raised proudly in the heart of Gaza – in memory of the soldiers of the Border Guard who fell. Keep yourselves heroes, eliminate as many enemies as possible and return to us in peace.”

Arab foreign ministers welcomed an agreement for a temporary truce but said it should be extended and become a first step toward a full cessation of hostilities.

The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan said at a roundtable discussion with journalists in London that the agreement, which includes hostage releases and stepped-up aid into the devastated Gaza Strip, should also ultimately lead to a resumption of talks for a two-state solution.

The Arab foreign ministers are leading a so-called contact group of mostly Muslim countries which are lobbying Israel’s major allies to bring about an end to the Gaza war.

President Tayyip Erdogan said he may travel to Egypt soon and discuss how to accelerate the evacuation of patients from Gaza and other steps, broadcaster Haberturk and other Turkish media reported on Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters on his plane returning from a trip to Algeria, Erdogan was reported as saying the Islamic world must act in a spirit of unity and solidarity on Gaza, and that Israel must be forced to comply with international law and give account of its actions in Gaza.

The process of recovering Israeli hostages is due to begin tomorrow, according to the country’s foreign minister.

At least 400 tunnel shafts have been destroyed by Israeli troops in Gaza since the beginning of the ground offensive last month.

Soldiers from the Israeli Defence Forces’ elite Yahalom combat engineering unit have played a key role, the IDF said.

Entrances to the tunnels have been uncovered embedded in civilian infrastructure, including inside hospitals, schools, residential buildings and other sites.

Israel has used the discoveries to bolster their claims that Hamas has used the Palestinian population as human shields.

Patients are being evacuated from al-Shifa Hospital by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society.

They have dispatched 14 ambulances, accompanied by the UN and Doctors Without Borders.

Kidney patients will be transferred to Abu Youssef Al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah, while those injured by Israeli strikes will be transferred to the European hospital south of Khan Younis.

French President Emmanuel Macron has welcomed the agreement between Hamas and Israel.

“We are working non-stop so that all the hostages are freed,” he said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

The French presidency did not return requests for a comment on French media reports that three French hostages could be liberated initially.

The Israeli Defence Forces are continuing operations in Gaza as a ceasefire looms on the horizon.

Israeli fighter jets are carrying out strikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, according to the Israeli Defence Forces.

The IDF said that the targets include a military compound where terrorists had convened, alongside other infrastructure.

The strikes follow rising tensions along the border and repeated attacks by Hezbollah and allied Palestinian factions.

Conflict between Israel and Hamas has gone beyond war to 'terrorism', Pope says

Pope Francis on Wednesday met separately with Israeli relatives of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinians with family in Gaza and said the conflict had gone beyond war to become “terrorism”.

Speaking in unscripted remarks at his Wednesday general audience in St. Peter’s Square shortly after the early morning meetings in his residence, Francis said he heard directly how “both sides are suffering”.

Six Palestinians killed in Israeli strike on West Bank

Six Palestinians were killed on Wednesday in Tolkurm camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement.

The Palestinians were targeted in an Israeli drone strike, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported earlier on Wednesday.

Another Palestinian was killed by Israeli forces near the city of Qalqilia, WAFA said, raising the number of Palestinians killed in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday to seven.

The Palestinian Authority on Wednesday welcomed a humanitarian truce agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, a senior Palestinian official said.

“President Mahmud Abbas and the leadership welcome the humanitarian truce agreement, value the Qatari-Egyptian effort made and reaffirm the call for a comprehensive cessation of the Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people and the entry of humanitarian aid,” senior official Hussein al-Sheikh wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

Palestinians injured as a result of the attacks of the Israeli army are being taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital for treatment in Deir al-Balah, Gaza.

Jordan hopes Gaza truce will be a step to end the war

Jordan said on Wednesday it hoped the Gaza truce would be a step that would end the war in Gaza and prevent the targeting of Palestinians and their displacement from their land.

In a statement on state media, the foreign ministry said it hoped the four-day pause will allow much-needed humanitarian aid.

The Almagor Terror Victims Association is set to file a petition against the hostage and ceasefire deal in Israel’s high court at noon today.

In a letter to Israeli Justice Minister Yariv Levin, Almagor founder Meir Indoor said:

“Almagor demands to see the list of prisoners Israel is considering releasing as part of the deal.

“The organisation also demands to see all details of the commitments Israel is making to Hamas regarding restrictions on combat during the ceasefire period, including the cessation of intelligence gathering, as well as the delivery of fuel and other supplies which may help Hamas conduct terror operations against residents of Israel.’

“Additionally, they call on justice minister Yariv Levin to disclose ‘the general commitments Israel is making to Hamas that have been given directly or through a third party.’”

Operations by the Israeli Defence Forces are ongoing in Gaza, with strikes being carried out against infrastructure and ground clashes with Hamas fighters.

The 7th Armored Brigade called in a number of airstrikes overnight, the IDF said, adding that the attacks were against sites where gunfire was directed at troops.

Sheikh Za’id, near Jabaliya, was raided by troops from the Givati Infantry Brigade and a number of Hamas observation posts were destroyed.

Several Hamas terrorists were killed as the Harel Armored Reserve Brigade struck Hamas tunnel infrastructure in northern Gaza, the IDF added.

A building in northern Gaza sheltering Hamas operatives and weapons was also destroyed by the 261st Reserve Brigade, killing those inside.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian is starting a regional tour following the announcement of the truce, the Nournews agency affiliated to Iran’s top security body reported on Wednesday.

“The visit is in line with Iran’s diplomatic efforts to halt the Zionist regime’s attacks on Gaza, lift the blockade and send humanitarian aid to the oppressed people of Gaza,” Nournews said.

Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said the temporary ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was a “crucial step”.

Hamas will release dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli prisons.

At least 53 journalists killed in conflict

At least 53 journalists have been killed in the conflict since October 7, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).

The total includes 46 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese, the CPJ said.

A reporter and photojournalist working for Lebanese media outlet Al Mayadeen are the most recent deaths.

They were killed on Tuesday during Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon, where tensions have flared in recent weeks.

The CPJ said that the conflict has been the deadliest period for journalists since it began tracking data in 1992.

“CPJ is also investigating numerous unconfirmed reports of other journalists being killed, missing, detained, hurt, or threatened,” the statement added.

Israel provided details on Wednesday about Palestinian prisoners slated for release under a foreign-mediated deal to recover hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza, a publication that appeared intended to allow for any last-minute legal challenges.

The list posted on the Justice Ministry appeared to include 300 prisoners, twice the jailed 150 females and minors that Israel has agreed to free in return for 50 hostages.

France hopes for release of its hostages

France hopes its eight citizens believed held as hostages will be released as a result of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas, Foreign Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna said on Wednesday.

“We hope that there will be French people among the first batch of hostages to be released,” Colonna told France Inter radio.

Ursula Von der Leyen, European Commission President, says that she welcomes the agreement reached between Israel and Hamas on the release of the 50 hostages and on a pause in hostilities in Gaza.

“The European Commission will do its utmost to use this pause for a humanitarian surge to Gaza,” she said in a statement.

As this picture of the United Nations delivering supplies on Tuesday shows, people in Gaza are desperate for basics like fresh water:

Russia “welcomes” a humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas, according to Moscow’s foreign ministry.

“Moscow welcomes the agreement between Israel and Hamas on a four-day humanitarian pause,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a post on Telegram.

Has Putin been trying to use the Israel-Palestine conflict to try to restore Russia’s reputation?

The family of American-Israeli hostage Abigail Edan are praying for the release of the little girl, who turns four on Friday.

“For our family, we have spent the last seven weeks...worrying, wondering, praying, hoping,” Abigail’s great aunty Liz Hirsh Naftali. told CNN.

“The one thing that we all hold on to is that hope now that Abigail comes home, she comes home by Friday...her 4th birthday. We need to see Abigail come out and then we will be able to believe it.”

Abigail’s parents were murdered at a kibbutz during the terror attack by Hamas on October 7.

The White House issued a statement from the US President:

“Jill and I have been keeping all those held hostage and their loved ones close to our hearts these many weeks,” Mr Biden said.

“I am extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls, who have endured weeks of captivity and an unspeakable ordeal, will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented.”

He added: “Today’s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released.”

Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear Israel will continue fighting at the end of the ceasefire, declaring last night “we will continue the war” until “we achieve all our goals”.

Qatari mediators, however, expressed hope the deal reached on Wednesday morning would lead to a permanent ceasefire.

Qatar’s chief negotiator, Minister of State at the Foreign Ministry Mohammed Al-Khulaifi, told Reuters that the International Committee of the Red Cross would be working inside Gaza to facilitate the hostages’ release during the “intensive period”.

“We’re going to be 24/7 in direct communication with the ICRC and the two parties making sure that we perfect the release of the hostages,” Mr Al-Khulaifi said.

He said that the truce means there would be “no attack whatsoever. No military movements, no expansion, nothing.”

Mr Al-Khulaifi added that Qatar hopes the deal “will be a seed to a bigger agreement and a permanent cease of fire. And that’s our intention.”

He added: “In our understanding it’s the light at the end of the tunnel. It is a positive development to this very difficult and complicated crisis that we’re living.”

First hostages could be freed in 24 hours

If everything goes to plan, the first of 50 hostages – all women and children – will be released by Hamas during a ceasefire to start as early as tomorrow.

Israel and Hamas have agreed on a complete pause in fighting for four days but that may be extended if the terror group frees more hostages, according to a US official who briefed journalists overnight.

“In terms of proof of life, we are confident that the 50 are there and will come out and we we believe there are others being held in this category [women and children],” the official said, adding “we do anticipate it’ll be more than 50”.



If Hamas need “additional days” to collect extra hostages before releasing them “that’s something that we’ll deal with”, the official said.

Washington also expressed hope the deal would lead to full pause in hostilities on the north of the Lebanese border.

Three Americans expected to be included in Gaza hostage release

Three Americans held by Hamas in Gaza since its attack on Israel last month are expected to be among at least 50 hostages to be released by the terrorist group, a senior US official said.

The three include a three-year-old girl whose parents were among the more than 1,200 people killed in Hamas’ initial Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel.

The American girl, named Abigail, will turn four on Friday, the official said. The hostage group will also include two American women.

Initial releases of hostages are expected within 24 hours of the deal’s announcement, with the first likely to be freed on Thursday morning, the official said.

“I would say it’s at least 50 of the women and children over a period of four to five days,” the official said, without providing details of any other nationalities expected to be released.

Hamas released a statement welcoming the “humanitarian truce”, which it said would also see 150 Palestinians released from Israeli jails.

“The provisions of this agreement were formulated according to the vision of the resistance and its determinants that aim to serve our people and enhance their steadfastness in the face of aggression,” a Hamas statement said.

We are hearing more about the mood inside the meeting room.

The vote passed after six hours of tense discussions in Tel Aviv.

Officials from Qatar, which has been mediating negotiations, as well as the US, Israel and Hamas had for days been saying a deal was imminent.

But before the vote this morning there was believed to be a revolt by hard-Right coalition partners who were opposing the release of Palestinian prisoners and the delivery of aid to Gaza.

Urging ministers to support the ceasefire deal, Benjamin Netanyahu reminded his colleagues on Tuesday night that the hostages’ return was a “sacred and top goal”.

Israel says the first hostages to be released would be women and children.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stipulated during the government meeting that the agreement would include visits by the Red Cross to hostages who have not yet been released, as well as the supply of medicine.

According to Haaretz news agency, which cited a senior Israeli official, Hamas would be expected to release 30 kidnapped children, eight mothers and 12 more women.

We have just received confirmation that Israel’s government has approved a ceasefire deal with the Hamas militant group.

• None EU sends tranche of 1.5 billion euros in macro-financial assistance to Ukraine
• None Military reports destroying almost 80% of Russian equipment near Avdiivka

Germany handed over 20 Marder armored vehicles, a Wisent-1 demining tank, 2,380 155mm shells, and other aid in its latest delivery to Ukraine, the German government said on Nov. 22.

Berlin previously provided Kyiv with 80 Marder infantry fighting vehicles drawn from military and industry stocks.

The delivery also included five Warthog ambulance carriers, two other ambulances, two 8x8 Hx81 tractors with two semi-trailers, and nine transport vehicles of various types. Ukraine received 2,428 crypto phones.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced a $1.4-billion defense aid package for Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv on Nov. 21.

This new package includes four IRIS-T SLM air defense systems, 20,000 155mm shells, and anti-tank mines, Pistorius said.

The same day, the Lithuanian Defense Ministry said it delivered 3 million units of 7.62x51mm small arms ammunition, remote detonation systems, and winter equipment to the Ukrainian military.

Lithuania on Nov. 10 announced it had supplied Ukraine with National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS).

Meanwhile, the Bulgarian parliament on Nov. 22 ratified an agreement to provide armored transport vehicles to Ukraine, together with corresponding armament and spare parts, the Bulgarian News Agency reported.

The agreement between the Bulgarian Interior Ministry and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry was supported by 131 Bulgarian lawmakers, with 49 voting against and one abstaining.

The deal was signed in Sofia on Aug. 8 and in Kyiv on Nov. 13.

The vehicles in question are no longer needed by the country's Interior Ministry, the news agency reported, without specifying the type or the number of the vehicles.

In addition, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called on Ukraine's allies during the 17th Ramstein-format meeting on Nov. 22 to strengthen Ukraine's air defenses ahead of the coming winter months.

Russia launched a mass wave of attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure during the fall and winter of 2022-2023, causing regular blackouts.

The European Union has sent the latest 1.5 billion euro ($1.6 billion) installment of its macro-financial assistance package to Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Nov. 22.

The tranche is part of an 18 billion euro ($19.6 billion) support package for 2023, known as the Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) package for Ukraine, which is disbursed in monthly tranches.

The package aims to assist Ukraine with paying for essential public services, maintaining macroeconomic stability, and restoring critical infrastructure destroyed by Russian attacks.

""Europe's funding has supported Ukraine's economic stability and public services since the start of Russia’s war,"" von der Leyen said on X.

EU support to Ukraine ""has now reached €85 billion ($92.7 billion),"" with ""more to come.""

The European Parliament voted in October to endorse a proposal for a $53 billion financing package for Ukraine's recovery until 2027.

Meanwhile, the European Union has prepared a framework to provide Ukraine with long-term security assistance, including the continued provision of weapons, training of Ukrainian troops, and support for Ukraine's domestic defense industry, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 21, citing internal EU documents.

The proposed measures will be discussed with EU ambassadors in the upcoming week and with senior EU leadership in December, according to the report.

The proposed G7 security guarantees would entail explicit and long-lasting obligations, as well as bolster Ukraine's ability to resist Russian aggression. They would also cover sanctions, financial aid, and post-war reconstruction.

The proposal comes as it appears likely the EU will fail to deliver on its pledge of one million shells to Ukraine by March 2024.

Weapons provisions from the EU would continue to operate under The European Peace Facility, in which member states are reimbursed for military aid sent to Ukraine.

North Macedonia completed the training of the first group of Ukrainian soldiers, a process kept confidential until now for security reasons, Balkan Insight reported on Nov. 22, citing the country's Defense Minister Slavjanka Petrovska.

The Balkan country will continue the training throughout 2024 and ""for as long as there is a need for it,"" Petrovska said in a comment for the national broadcaster Macedonian Television on Nov. 22.

The minister said that the instructions took place in facilities owned by the North Macedonian military, but she did not clarify the type of training or the number of Ukrainian soldiers that went through it.

A NATO member since 2020, North Macedonia has provided Ukraine with a number of Soviet-era military hardware as it is restocking with Western equipment. The supplied aid includes four Su-25 aircraft, T-72 tanks, small arms, munitions, and other support.

The country's government also reportedly approved the provision of combat helicopters earlier this year.

Over 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have already received training in partner countries since the start of the full-scale invasion, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Nov. 21.

Russia deployed several columns of armored vehicles during unsuccessful attacks near Avdiivka on Nov. 22, losing almost 80% of equipment, the Tavria group spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun said.

Russian forces continue trying to surround Avdiivka, launching 13 unsuccessful attacks against the front-line town and settlements on its flanks, Shtupun said today on television.

According to the spokesperson, Russian forces are dealing with desertion, and seven Russian soldiers surrendered to Ukrainian troops on Nov. 21.

Russian forces intensified ground attacks against Avdiivka and surrounding settlements in early October in an attempt to encircle the town. The campaign has been supported by heavy shelling and air strikes, which continue to inflict casualties among civilian residents.

Shtupun warned on Nov. 18 that Russia is preparing to launch the third wave of attacks against Avdiivka.

Russia's onslaught against Avdiivka, the gateway to occupied Donetsk, has been very costly for Moscow.

According to the Ukrainian military, Russian forces lost around 10,000 soldiers, more than 100 tanks, over 250 other armored vehicles, and seven Su-25 aircraft in the month of fighting near Avdiivka.

Russia has been trying to capture the small industrial town just north of occupied Donetsk since 2014.

On the southeastern front lines, Russian forces have significantly increased assaults and airstrikes, but Ukrainian troops have hindered Russian gains, General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, the commander of the Tavria Group, reported on Nov. 22.

Russian forces have carried out 29 airstrikes and almost 1,000 artillery barrages over the past day, according to Tarnavskyi.

During their assaults, Russian forces suffered heavy losses, totaling up to 500 casualties, as well as three tanks, several other pieces of military hardware, and three ammunition depots, said Tarnavskyi.

The general also said Ukrainian forces continue their offensive in the direction of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol.

Meanwhile, dozens of Russian marines were killed by a Ukrainian strike during an awards ceremony near occupied Starobesheve southeast of Donetsk on Nov. 19, the Ukrainian military reported on Nov. 22.

The unit confirmed the strike on the marines and said the number of casualties had been reported by Russian propagandists.

Robert “Magyar” Brovdi, a commander at Ukraine's 59th Brigade, reported on Nov. 21 that 25 Russian marines had been killed and more than 100 had been injured.

Ukraine's Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said the strike on the 128th Brigade was the result of basic security measures being ignored, adding that it likely could have been avoided.

1141966661,20231123,"Day 637 of the invasion of Ukraine. Summary of key events in the last 24 hours:
• Putin allowed ""negotiations"" about the ""tragedy"" in Ukraine and compared Russia to Israel
• Putin's administration quells a protest by relatives of those mobilized with money
• Ukraine claims to have killed 320,000 Russians since the war began
• The EU will produce 1.4 million shells for Ukraine by spring

Putin allowed ""negotiations"" about the ""tragedy"" in Ukraine and compared Russia to Israel

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his country is ""ready for negotiations"" and must think about how to end the ""tragedy"" in Ukraine.

In his first statement to the G20 group of nations since Russia invaded Ukraine, he also attacked Kyiv with accusations of the failure of dialogue so far and tried to compare the invasion to the conflict between Israel and the Islamist movement Hamas.

This G20 summit, two months after the leaders' in-person meeting in New Delhi, India (which Putin did not attend due to his ""busy schedule""), was video-conferenced. US President Joe Biden decided not to participate in it, and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, according to Bloomberg, was represented by Premier Li Qiang.

Putin hit back at other leaders who said they were shaken by the war, which has become (if military casualties are taken into account) Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II and the most serious confrontation between Russia and the West in decades.

""Yes, of course, military action is always a tragedy,"" Putin said. ""And, of course, we have to think about how to stop this tragedy,"" Putin said. ""By the way, Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine.""

Last October, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree calling talks on Ukraine ""impossible"" under the current leadership in the Kremlin, although he left the door open to negotiations with Russia. Meanwhile, a Russian official told Reuters that Moscow cannot work with the current government in Kyiv either, and the ""special military operation"" (i.e., the war) must continue in order to ""demilitarize"" Ukraine.

This comes days after Zelensky began issuing warnings about a Russian plan to oust him from power. He said yesterday that Moscow's plan is to carry out this intention by the end of the year.

After calling the hostilities a ""tragedy"", he moved on to the war between Israel and Hamas, saying: ""And the extermination of the civilian population in Palestine, in the Gaza Strip, didn't this shake people today? And the fact that doctors have to operate children, to operate with a scalpel on children's bodies without anesthesia - doesn't that shake people?""

Since the beginning of the war, Russia has been in contact with Hamas and has strongly advocated an end to the war and the fighting in Gaza.

Israel, however, turned out to be only one point in his comparison of tragedies, which he mentioned before the 2014 revolution in Ukraine that toppled President Viktor Yanukovych: ""And the bloody coup in Ukraine in 2014, followed by the Kyiv regime's war against its own people in Donbas - didn't that shake you?""

Russia insists that the events that began in Ukraine in 2013 due to Ukraine's departure from the EU, chosen by Yanukovych, were a Western-directed scenario that led to the ""coup"". Moscow also insists that Kyiv is committing encroachments against ""Russian-speaking"" people in eastern Ukraine, which prompted its de facto intervention in the Donbas in 2014, which escalated into a full-scale invasion in 2022.

Putin's administration quells a protest by relatives of those mobilized with money



The administration of the Russian president has advised the regional authorities to ""suppress with money"" the protests of the relatives of mobilized servicemen who insist on their return from the front, Verstka reports, citing its sources.

The Kremlin is sure that ""the wives are waiting for the bank cards with the salary from the war, not their husbands"".

""If it is not possible to solve all the problems, to pay everyone the maximum amount of money. <...> At the same time, it is necessary to separate the dissatisfied as much as possible on private issues - some need a husband, others money, others just to be listened to,"" one of the sources described the Kremlin's recommendations.

AP believes that the dissatisfaction of the relatives of those mobilized is one of the main problems of the presidential election campaign.

In recent weeks, relatives of those mobilized have tried to hold rallies in several Russian regions. In most cases the authorities refused them; in Novosibirsk, they allowed a ""closed rally"". In Moscow, the authorities refused to hold a rally on October 25, citing the epidemiological situation. The day before, the organizers challenged this decision in court. Relatives of those mobilized submitted a request to hold a concert on December 16 at ""Teatralna Square"" dedicated to Mother's Day.

Ukraine claims to have killed 320,000 Russians since the war began

Over the past 24 hours, 850 Russian soldiers have been killed in Ukraine, and since the beginning of the full-scale war, the total combat losses of the enemy have amounted to 320,670 people, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Army.

A huge amount of destroyed equipment is also reported, in particular artillery systems - 7769 (+17 in the past day), tanks - 5446 (+7), armored fighting vehicles - 10188 (+14), operational-tactical UAV - 5784 (+ 13), air defense equipment - 589 (+1), automotive equipment and tankers - 10159 (+25), special equipment - 1105 (+7).

In addition, since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 899 enemy MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket System), 323 aircraft, 324 helicopters, 1,564 cruise missiles, 22 ships/boats and one submarine have been destroyed, writes the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN.

The General Staff also reported drone and cruise missile attacks that night.

The Air Force reported that Russian forces attacked from the southeast direction (Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Russia) with 14 Shahed drones and an X-22 cruise missile from a Tu22M3 aircraft from the same direction. All 14 Shahed-131/136 drones were destroyed.

The Kh-22 cruise missile missed its target and fell in the Zaporizhzhia region in the open, and private houses were damaged by the blast wave. According to preliminary data, no one was injured.

Ukraine was attacked with 14 drones and several missiles last night, Kyiv reported. Air defense systems have disabled all drones.

In the waters of the Black Sea, in the direction of Crimea, 4 sea drones were destroyed, the Russian Ministry of Defense wrote on its Telegram channel.

The European Union will keep its promise to provide one million shells to Ukraine and even more. This was said by the European Commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, in Strasbourg.

According to him, this unit will be produced in the spring. A week ago, the European Union's high representative for foreign policy, Josep Borrell, admitted that the Union may not be able to deliver the promised shells by the end of the year.

The EU will produce 1.4 million shells for Ukraine by spring

The EU will produce 1.3 or 1.4 million 152 and 155 caliber shells for Ukraine by spring, surpassing the promised 1 million.

This was stated by the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He answered questions from MEPs about how the EU would fulfill its promise to deliver 1 million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine by March 2024.

""We made the commitment in the spring when there was such an opportunity. I have told this Parliament that it will be implemented,"" Breton pointed out.

Breton also recalled another commitment made by EU member states. It is to supply munitions from their stockpiles through joint purchasing and other means as the industrial base grows and as opportunity arises.

The reason the EU currently does not have the power to produce enough ammunition is the fact that capacity has declined in peacetime.

Thierry Breton admitted that 40 percent of EU arms production currently goes outside Europe.

""We must ask all member states' defense ministers to clearly and firmly state and tell their defense businesses to prioritize exports to Ukraine in the coming months. I make this request here, in front of you, in front of the European Parliament, to all ministers,"" said the European Commissioner.

He tried to calm the MEPs by saying that the commitment was for spring, and now winter has not yet come. Breton recalled that he had visited a number of countries where weapons were produced.

“If the funds are there, the capacity will be there. If the production enterprises in France, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria show discipline and put pressure on the producers, we will keep the commitment,"" assured Breton.

Video shows how Russia helps migrants cross the border with Finland

Finland has accused Russia of handing out bicycles and scooters to migrants to help them cross the border as part of a plan to destabilize Europe.

Antti Hakkanen, Finland's defense minister, accused the Kremlin of using its hybrid warfare ""playbook"" by encouraging migrants to enter the country without documents.

Helsinki ordered the closure of four of its eight road crossing points with Russia, and the European Commission promised to send a border control unit to Finland.

After supplying Russia with missiles, Pyongyang was able to launch a missile with a military satellite

South Korea has announced it is unilaterally suspending part of a 2018 inter-Korean agreement to reduce military tensions in response to the launch of a military satellite by its northern neighbor.

North Korea said it had placed its first spy satellite into orbit on Tuesday and promised to launch it in the near future. Pictures released by North Korean state media showed leader Kim Jong-un watching the missile launch.

South Korea and Japan, which first reported the launch, said they were still verifying that the satellite was in orbit, and the Pentagon said the US military was still assessing whether the launch was successful.

Seoul will resume intelligence and border surveillance under a proposal approved at an emergency cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Han Dak-su.

""North Korea has clearly demonstrated its unwillingness to abide by the Sept. 19 military agreement aimed at reducing military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and building confidence,"" Yonhap news agency quoted Han Duck-sooas saying.

It is noted that Seoul will immediately resume intelligence operations in the area of the Military Demarcation Line separating the two Koreas, also known as the Demilitarized Zone.

""The ability of our armed forces to identify threat targets and their readiness to respond will be greatly improved,"" the prime minister said.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is on a state visit to the UK, approved the denunciation remotely.

The launch is the first since Kim Jong-un met Russian President Vladimir Putin at Russia's state-of-the-art space facility in September, where the Russian president pledged to help Pyongyang build satellites.

South Korean officials said the latest launch likely involved technical assistance from Moscow as part of a growing partnership in which North Korea sends millions of artillery shells to Russia.

Earlier, Pyongyang announced its first successful launch of the Chollima-1 launch vehicle, which put the Mulligen-1 satellite into orbit, as well as plans to launch several more such satellites ""soon.""

Previously, Pyongyang made two unsuccessful attempts to put a reconnaissance satellite into orbit - in May and August this year.

Finland will leave just one border crossing open on its frontier with Russia to stem a flow of asylum seekers that is believed to be a hybrid operation masterminded by Moscow.

The European Union has presented member states with a framework to give Ukraine lasting security commitments, including a mechanism for longer-term military support, the training of Ukrainian troops and help to boost the country’s defence industry.

After months of acrimony, a much-anticipated meeting between Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky ended with both sides reaching an understanding of each other’s positions on Russia’s war.

China was willing to strengthen ties with Russia and jointly promote the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in a meeting on Wednesday with Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin of the Duma, Russia’s lower legislative house, according to state-run broadcaster CCTV.

Volodin said Russia adhered to the one-China policy and firmly supported China in safeguarding territorial integrity, according to the statement.

Beijing has provided Moscow with diplomatic and economic support since Vladimir Putin ordered the attack on Ukraine in February 2022, support that has mitigated the effects of Western sanctions on Russia.

Finland seals bulk of Russian border with one station left open

Finland will leave just one border crossing open on its frontier with Russia to stem a flow of asylum seekers seen as a hybrid operation masterminded by Moscow.

The Nordic country will close another three road checkpoints after already shuttering the four busiest ones last week, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Wednesday, citing a “worsening situation”.

Only the northernmost crossing, Raja-Jooseppi in Lapland, will stay open starting in the early hours of 25 November, Interior Minister Mari Rantanen told reporters in Helsinki. The decision is “unavoidable,” she said, adding the government stands ready to do more if needed.

Orpo had on Monday warned Russia that more border crossings would be closed if migrants continued to be brought there by Russian officials.

Asylum seekers from countries including Yemen and Afghanistan have continued to arrive at Salla and Vartius checkpoints, which are located in remote areas. Many come lightly clothed in freezing weather, most with bicycles, including children’s bikes, local media have reported. Their lack of gear and suitable vehicles indicates they are getting transport from Russia.

Finland’s government says the operation threatens national security, and on Saturday sealed the southeastern stretch of the border in response.

The newest member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation guards 1,300km of border with Russia, the alliance’s longest stretch facing its main adversary.

The European Union has presented member states with a framework to give Ukraine lasting security commitments, including a mechanism for longer-term military support, the training of Ukrainian troops and help to boost the country’s defence industry.

The draft paper, which has been seen by Bloomberg, will be discussed by EU ambassadors this week and by the bloc’s leaders next month. It will also form the basis of consultations with Kyiv and the Group of Seven nations.

G7 members agreed at a Nato summit earlier this year to negotiate a collection of bilateral security guarantees with Ukraine aimed at deterring future Russian aggression. For its part, Ukraine committed to continuing a series of reforms, including to law enforcement, its judiciary as well as security and defence sectors. Some of Kyiv’s key allies are seeking to conclude bilateral agreements this year.

The EU’s framework aims to build on those bilateral arrangements, with proposals including:
• “A predictable, efficient, sustainable and long-term mechanism for the provision of military equipment to Ukraine” that mobilises the European defence industry.
• Greater cooperation with the Ukrainian defence industry to boost capacity and align standards.
• Strengthening Ukraine’s ability to counter cyber and hybrid threats as well as disinformation.
• Helping Ukraine with its reform agenda relating to its EU accession process, as well as boosting its ability to monitor stocks of firearms, light weapons and ammunition and counter any illegal trafficking.

Russian oil-product flows have surged this month as local refiners boost processing rates due to the end of seasonal maintenance and the nation’s continued easing of export restrictions.

The rebound helps to offset what has been a grinding decline in seaborne crude cargoes over the past several weeks. That’s important because Russia counts combined crude and fuel flows as metrics for compliance with a pact with Opec+. The producer group will meet in the next several days to discuss future supply plans.

Led by a hike in diesel, Russia’s fuel shipments jumped to about 2.4 million barrels a day through 18 November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from analytics firm Vortexa. That’s up about 333,000 barrels a day from October, meaning they’re on pace to reach a four-month high.

After months of acrimony, a much-anticipated meeting between Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky ended with both sides reaching an understanding of each other’s positions on Russia’s war.

The two presidents also promised to maintain contact, officials from each nation said after Wednesday’s exchange, which took place on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

Lula, who has refrained from taking sides between Russia and Ukraine, described the event as “the meeting that was supposed to happen and needed to happen”.

“I know it’s difficult for both him and Putin,” Lula told journalists after being with Zelensky. “No one will have 100% in a war, no one can win everything.” The Latin American leader also said it was necessary to build “a lasting peace so that there will never again be a territorial occupation like Russia did”.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the bilateral as an “important moment,” as Zelensky sought to rally support from the Global South for the 18-month-old war. Lula has claimed that Ukraine and the US shared blame for escalating it.

“The conversation was very warm and honest. And I think both presidents now understand each other’s position much better than before it,” Kuleba told reporters in New York, before accidentally referring to Lula as “President Putin”. DM"

1141962331,20231123,"Olha Stefanishyna, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, expressed hope that EU members would not allow Hungary to block the start of negotiations with Ukraine on joining the EU.

Source: Stefanishyna in an interview with Sofiia Sereda, journalist of Ukrainska Pravda, as reported by European Pravda

Details: The official admitted that Hungary has a ""legal opportunity"" to block the start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession to the European Union at a summit in mid-December. She called ""alarming"" the fact that the European Commissioner for Hungary at one of the recent events did not mention the European Commission's recommendation on negotiations whatsoever.

Quote: ""But I think that Hungary's veto is much more important for strong EU states than for Ukraine. Because the future of Europe is at stake – from Albania to Chisinau – and the understanding that the decisions that are being made now affect stability in Europe in general,"" she added.

Stefanishyna explained that after Ukraine’s victory, Europe should ""cement this victory on the continent"" and neutralise other possible conflicts.

""And therefore I am sure that the most influential and progressive EU states will not allow Hungary to be at the centre of all events, because the future of Europe should be at the centre of events,"" the vice prime minister concluded.

On 8 November, the European Commission recommended that the European Council begin accession negotiations with Moldova and Ukraine. The final decision on the start of negotiations should be made by the leaders of the member countries at a meeting on 14-15 December.

In recent days, there have been signals from the EU that the Union may not support the start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession during the December summit. There is allegedly a possibility of postponing this decision until March due to a lack of unity in the European Union. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said the European Union should not start EU accession negotiations with Ukraine, adding that this is Hungary's ""clear"" stance.

1141962335,20231123,"NEW YORK – It's been quite a week for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — and co-founder Sam Altman.

Altman, who helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research lab back in 2015, was removed as CEO Friday in a sudden and mostly unexplained exit that stunned the industry. And while his chief executive title was swiftly reinstated just days later, a lot of questions are still up in the air.

If you're just catching up on the OpenAI saga and what's at stake for the artificial intelligence space as a whole, you've come to the right place. Here's a rundown of what you need to know.

WHO IS SAM ALTMAN AND HOW DID HE RISE TO FAME?

Altman is co-founder of OpenAI, the San Francisco-based company behind ChatGPT (yes, the chatbot that's seemingly everywhere today — from schools to health care ).

The explosion of ChatGPT since its arrival one year ago propelled Altman into the spotlight of the rapid commercialization of generative AI — which can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. And as he became Silicon Valley’s most sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of this technology, Altman helped transform OpenAI into a world-renowned startup.

But his position at OpenAI hit some rocky turns in a whirlwind that was the past week. Altman was fired as CEO Friday — and days later, he was back on the job with a new board of directors.

Within that time, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has rights to its existing technology, helped drive Altman's return, quickly hiring him as well as another OpenAI co-founder and former president, Greg Brockman, who quit in protest after the CEO's ousting. Meanwhile, hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to resign.

Both Altman and Brockman celebrated their returns to the company in posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, early Wednesday.

WHY DOES HIS REMOVAL — AND REINSTATEMENT — MATTER?

There's a lot that remains unknown about Altman's initial ousting. Friday's announcement said he was “not consistently candid in his communications” with the then-board of directors, which refused to provide more specific details.

Regardless, the news sent shockwaves throughout the AI world — and, because OpenAI and Altman are such leading players in this space, may raise trust concerns around a burgeoning technology that many people still have questions about.

“The OpenAI episode shows how fragile the AI ecosystem is right now, including addressing AI’s risks,” said Johann Laux, an expert at the Oxford Internet Institute focusing on human oversight of artificial intelligence.

The turmoil also accentuated the differences between Altman and members of the company’s previous board, who have expressed various views on the safety risks posed by AI as the technology advances.

Multiple experts add that this drama highlights how it should be governments — and not big tech companies — that should be calling the shots on AI regulation, particularly for fast-evolving technologies like generative AI.

“The events of the last few days have not only jeopardized OpenAI’s attempt to introduce more ethical corporate governance in the management of their company, but it also shows that corporate governance alone, even when well-intended, can easily end up cannibalized by other corporate’s dynamics and interests,” said Enza Iannopollo, principal analyst at Forrester.

The lesson, Iannopollo said, is that companies can’t alone deliver the level of safety and trust in AI that society needs. “Rules and guardrails, designed with companies and enforced by regulators with rigor, are crucial if we are to benefit from AI,” he added.

WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI? HOW IS IT BEING REGULATED?

Unlike traditional AI, which processes data and completes tasks using predetermined rules, generative AI (including chatbots like ChatGPT) can create something new.

Tech companies are still leading the show when it comes to governing AI and its risks, while governments around the world work to catch up.

In the European Union, negotiators are putting the final touches on what’s expected to be the world’s first comprehensive AI regulations. But they’ve reportedly been bogged down over whether and how to include the most contentious and revolutionary AI products, the commercialized large-language models that underpin generative AI systems including ChatGPT.

Chatbots were barely mentioned when Brussels first laid out its initial draft legislation in 2021, which focused on AI with specific uses. But officials have been racing to figure out how to incorporate these systems, also known as foundation models, into the final version.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., President Joe Biden signed an ambitious executive order last month seeking to balance the needs of cutting-edge technology companies with national security and consumer rights.

The order — which will likely need to be augmented by congressional action — is an initial step that is meant to ensure that AI is trustworthy and helpful, rather than deceptive and destructive. It seeks to steer how AI is developed so that companies can profit without putting public safety in jeopardy."
1141962338,20231123,"Finland will close all but the northernmost crossing point on its border with Russia from Friday in a bid to halt a flow of asylum seekers to the Nordic nation, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Wednesday.

Since the beginning of the month, more than 600 people without valid travel documents to the European Union have come to Finland via Russia, prompting Helsinki to shut several crossings and accuse Moscow of funneling migrants. The Kremlin denies the charge.

""The government has today decided to close more border stations,"" Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told a press conference.

The asylum seekers come from a wide range of nations including Yemen, Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria, according to immigration authorities.

The Finnish border guard said on Wednesday that organized illegal entry to Finland continued at the Russian border and had moved further north along the 1340-km border to Vartius and Salla, two border stations that still accepted asylum applications.

""There are growing signs that the situation is worsening on the eastern border,"" Mr. Orpo said.

Finland will close three of the four remaining border crossing points starting at midnight on Friday, leaving only the Raja-Jooseppi open.

""Raja-Jooseppi is the northernmost (border crossing) and it requires a real effort to get there,"" Mr. Orpo said.

Finland's President Sauli Niinisto on Monday said returning people who don't meet the criteria for asylum had become impossible and called for an EU-wide solution to stop uncontrollable entry to Europe's passport-free Schengen area.

The Kremlin said on Monday it had lodged a formal protest over the partial border closure, saying the decision reflected an anti-Russian stance.

In 2021, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia accused Moscow's close ally Belarus of artificially creating a migrant crisis on their borders by flying in people from the Middle East and Africa and attempting to push them across the frontier - an accusation Belarus repeatedly denied."

1141975607,20231123,"SKOPJE, North Macedonia — Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama urged NATO on Wednesday to further boost its military forces in Kosovo and secure the country’s borders with Serbia, warning that recent ethnic violence in Kosovo could potentially trigger a wider Balkan conflict.

Kosovo’s border with Serbia was “out of control,” Rama said after an informal meeting of Western Balkan NATO members in North Macedonia.

He said the frontier was being used for a host of illegal activities, including drugs and arms smuggling and infiltration by ultra nationalists, that could lead to “great disturbances” in the region.

Kosovo, which has an ethnic Albanian majority, is a former Serbian province. It gained independence with the help of a NATO military campaign, launched in 1999 to end a bloody Serb crackdown on an armed separatist movement.

Tensions remain high, with violence breaking out twice in recent months, and Western countries fear that Russia could try to foment trouble in the Balkans to avert attention from the war in Ukraine.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the meeting in North Macedonia’s capital, Skopje, insisted after Wednesday’s talks that NATO doesn’t see any military threat to its allies in the Western Balkans.

“But what we do see is an increase in tensions, especially in Kosovo,” Stoltenberg said.

He said that NATO has strengthened its military presence in Kosovo - established after the 1999 bombing campaign against Serbia - with about 1,000 additional troops and heavier weaponry.

“We are cautious, of course. We are closely monitoring the situation and we will certainly do what is necessary to protect and defend our allies,” Stoltenberg said.

During a visit to Kosovo on Monday, Stoltenberg said that NATO was considering deploying additional peacekeeping troops there. On Tuesday in Belgrade, he said that the recent violent outbreaks in Kosovo were unacceptable and perpetrators must be brought to justice.

In May, Serb demonstrators in northern Kosovo clashed with NATO peacekeeping troops. In September, a Kosovo police officer and three Serb gunmen were killed in a shootout after about 30 masked men opened fire on a police patrol near the Kosovo village of Banjska.

Serbia doesn’t recognize Kosovo’s formal declaration of independence in 2008. Both countries want to join the European Union, which is mediating a dialogue between the former foes. Brussels has warned both that refusal to compromise jeopardizes their chances of joining the bloc.

Wednesday’s talks in Skopje were attended by Rama, the prime ministers of North Macedonia and Montenegro, Dimitar Kovačevski and Milojko Spajić, as well as Croatian President Zoran Milanović."

Israel’s national security adviser said late Wednesday that cease-fire talks with the Hamas militant group were still ongoing, and the hostage release will not take place before Friday. Tzachi Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

The cease-fire agreement between the Hamas militant group and Israel had earlier been confirmed by both parties, along with Washington and Qatar, which helped broker the deal that would bring a temporary halt to the devastating war that is now in its seventh week.

The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas will free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages taken in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel will release some Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Egyptian state media say the truce will begin Thursday morning. Egypt helped mediate the cease-fire agreement, which would bring the first respite to war-weary Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Wednesday he told U.S. President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with the war after a cease-fire expires. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United States military says one of its warships in the Red Sea has shot down bomb-carrying drones launched from territory controlled by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.

The military arm of Yemen’s Houthi rebels said earlier Wednesday that it launched a batch of long-range large missiles toward southern Israel, including the Red Sea city of Eilat. The Iran-backed rebel group has launched at least six aerial attacks against Israel since the conflict broke out on Oct. 7.

The Houthi are staunch foes of Israel and have vowed to continue aerial attacks and hijackings of Israeli ships.

The American military’s Central Command said the USS Thomas Hudner, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, shot down the drones early Thursday morning.

“The ship and crew sustained no damage or injury,” Central Command said, but did not identify what it believed the drones were targeting.

BEIRUT — An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon late Wednesday is believed to have killed the son of the head of Hezbollah’s parliamentary bloc in Lebanon, Mohammed Raad. Hezbollah announced early Thursday that five of its fighters were killed, among them Abbas Mohammed Raad, identified by local media as the son of the legislator.

The Lebanese militant group has a political wing that has long held seats in the country’s parliament.

The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli airstrike on a house in the town of Beit Yahoun late Wednesday killed four people and wounded one. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike.

On Wednesday, Hamas announced that Khalil Kharraz, a commander of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing in Lebanon, was killed in an Israeli airstrike the day before. Also on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike killed two journalists from the pan-Arab TV channel Al Mayadeen as they were reporting in south Lebanon. The Israeli military has said it is looking into the incident.

The Lebanon-Israel border has seen daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. While mostly limited to the border area, the clashes have stirred fears of a wider regional war.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser says a planned hostage-for-prisoner swap with Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.

In a statement released late Wednesday, Tzachi Hanegbi said that contacts on the deal were continuing. “The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday,” he said.

The swap is to take place as part of a four-day truce expected to begin on Thursday.

Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has instructed the country’s Mossad spy agency to track down the leadership of the Hamas militant group living in other countries outside Gaza.

“I have instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas, wherever they are,” Netanyahu told a news conference.

Most of Hamas’ top leadership lives in exile, primarily in the Gulf state of Qatar and the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The Mossad has been accused in a series of assassinations overseas of Palestinian militants and Iranian nuclear scientists over the years.

CAIRO — The U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that almost 1,037,000 internally displaced Palestinians were currently seeking shelter in 156 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip.

In its report, the aid agency said that the number of its workers killed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza stands at 108. The information in the report was valid as of Tuesday.

Earlier Wednesday, UNRWA’s Secretary General, Philippe Lazzarini, gave a press conference in southern Gaza warning that the suffering of Palestinians will only worsen with the coming of winter, and that the besieged territory is on the verge of a waterborne disease outbreak.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a temporary truce was agreed between Israel and Hamas that will facilitate the release of dozens of people taken hostage during the militant group’s assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

The move has been welcomed by UNRWA whose leaders have continually called for a cease-fire.

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with Israel’s war against Hamas after a temporary cease-fire expires.

Netanyahu said he delivered the message to Biden in a phone call on Wednesday.

“I want to be clear. The war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals,” Netanyahu said.

A four-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is expected to take effect on Thursday.

Hamas can extend the truce by releasing more of the hostages it is holding.

But Netanyahu, along with the other members of his special war cabinet, told a press conference they will resume the war until Hamas is destroyed and all of the 240 hostages it is holding are released.

JERUSALEM — The Israeli army says it has released an award-winning Palestinian poet it detained in Gaza.

Mosab Abu Toha has been contributing pieces to western media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire picture of its toll on civilians through his personal experience.

His family announced Monday that Abu Toha had been arrested while evacuating to southern Gaza from his home in the hard-hit Jabaliya refugee camp. Abu Toha last posted to X on Nov. 15, writing: “Alive. Thanks for your prayers.”

Diana Buttu, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and friend of the family, said Abu Toha was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint and held for two days with dozens of other Palestinians at an Israeli detention center. She says he was was accused of having Hamas connections and beaten up in custody. She said he was released on Tuesday, apparently after the case attracted international attention.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that Abu Toha had been released. It gave no further details.

Buttu said Abu Toha was safe in central Gaza after receiving medical treatment. The poet, whose son is an American citizen, is trying to leave the besieged territory.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — More than 100 bodies were buried Wednesday in a mass grave in Khan Younis, the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheets fastened with cable ties.

Medical workers placed dozens of bodies brought from various areas in northern Gaza, including Shifa Hospital, into a huge trench that was dug using a bulldozer.

Workers wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the bodies to the grave and performed funeral prayers.

GENEVA — International aid groups that have lined up thousands of aid trucks for Gaza say they’re ready to move quickly to send in food, water and other supplies during an agreed, but yet undated, pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Details remain unclear about both the mechanics of getting more aid for beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza and the possible release of hostages kidnapped from Israel whose families have desperately sought their release.

“The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to the fine print of the announced deal.

Della Longa lamented bottlenecks that have confounded the scant deliveries of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He said IFRC hopes that a deal would include provisions to allow for a “faster track” of aid shipments.

The only route for international humanitarian aid into Gaza since Oct. 7 has been through the Rafah Crossing into Egypt, and planeloads of supplies have been flown into the nearby Egyptian city of El-Arish — and trucks have queued up near Gaza, where intense Israeli inspections of trucks and cargo have slowed entry.

WASHINGTON — A major Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq has warned it may strike additional U.S. targets after U.S. warplanes killed multiple militants in response to the first use of short-range ballistic missiles against U.S. forces at Al-Asad Air Base earlier this week.

U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and a Kataib Hezbollah command and control node south of Baghdad on Tuesday, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional sensitive details of the attacks.

There were Kataib Hezbollah personnel at both sites at the time of the strikes, but the officials said they could not yet confirm whether anyone there was killed.

Militia officials in Iraq said the attack had killed eight Kataib Hezbollah members.

Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday that it was considering “expanding the scope of targets” if the U.S. military continues with its strikes, adding that the attack “will not go unpunished.”

The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities on Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. The attacks have continued unabated since, with at least 66 rocket and missile attacks hitting U.S. facilities and wounding at least 62 service members.

Associated Press writers Tara Copp in Washington, D.C., and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed.

GENEVA — Switzerland’s executive branch said Wednesday it will ask parliament to ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The Federal Council said the government will also end contracts it has with three Palestinian non-governmental organizations. They were among 11 Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that had been under review by Swiss officials following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.

Four days after the deadly rampage in Israel, the council moved to designate Hamas as a terrorist group and instructed the Foreign Ministry to consider a possible ban.

The seven-member council, which includes the Swiss president, reiterated its condemnation of the attacks “in the strongest possible terms” and expressed its regret about the deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict.

The United States and the European Union, which does not count Switzerland as a member, have long considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on the international community to provide “timely and sustained humanitarian assistance” to the Palestinians in Gaza.

Modi was speaking at a virtual meeting of Group of 20 nations on Wednesday before India’s presidency ends on Nov. 30.

“We agree that terrorism is unacceptable to all of us. The death of civilians anywhere is condemnable,” Modi said. “We welcome the news today concerning the release of the hostages. We hope that all the hostages will be released soon.”

Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the war in Gaza — a breakthrough that will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages held by militants as well as Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and bring a large influx of aid to the besieged territory, officials said Wednesday.

“It is important to provide timely and sustained humanitarian assistance. It is also important to ensure that the war between Israel and Hamas does not take any regional form,” Modi said.

CAIRO — Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV says the Israel-Hamas truce will take effect at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) Thursday.

Egypt helped mediate the four-day cease-fire, which will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The deal will also see the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israeli media also reported that the truce would begin Thursday at 10 a.m.

CAIRO — The World Health Organization has documented 178 attacks on healthcare facilities that killed 553 people, including 22 healthcare workers, since the war started on Oct. 7, the agency’s regional director said Wednesday.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari said in an online briefing that about 800 people, including 48 healthcare workers, were injured in the attacks, which damaged 24 hospitals and 32 ambulances.

The war has forced the shutdown of 27 out of 36 hospitals and 47 out of 72 primary health care clinics across Gaza, he said. The facilities stopping providing services mainly because of a lack of fuel and attacks, he said.

“Hospitals must be allowed to replenish the resources they need to continue functioning,” he said. “We cannot keep providing drops of aid in an ocean of needs.”

CAIRO — The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering.

It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers.

The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike.

Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.”

Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives.

WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.”

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.”

In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives in Gaza.

Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath.

Francis said: “Here we’ve gone beyond war. This isn’t war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.”

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s Justice Ministry has published a list of 300 Palestinian detainees and prisoners who could potentially be released in a hostage deal.

Most of those on the list published Wednesday are teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses, including throwing rocks or alleged incitement. None was convicted of murder, though some served sentences for attempted murder.

The youngest detainee on the list is 14, and it also includes around 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

According to the truce-for-hostages deal announced Wednesday, 50 hostages will be released over four days, likely starting Thursday, during which fighting will pause.

After that, every additional 10 hostages released will result in one additional day in the pause and the release of additional Palestinian prisoners.

Israel is expected to release 150 Palestinian prisoners in the first four days, though the Ministry of Justice published the list of 300 in case the deal is extended. Under Israeli law, the public has 24 hours to object to any release.

CAIRO — The evacuation of patients trapped in Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has begun, the Palestinian Red Crescent says.

The charity said 14 ambulances arrived at the hospital on Wednesday, and the evacuation has been coordinated with the United Nations and Doctors without Borders medical group.

Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, has said there were over 250 patients at the facility, which was besieged by the Israeli military earlier this month. Over 400 displaced people sheltering in the facility have also been trapped there, he said.

Israel has accused Hamas of using the hospital, the largest in Gaza, to conduct militant operations. Hamas and health officials have denied the allegation.

Over the weekend, the World Health Organization coordinated the evacuation of 31 premature babies from Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza. Of them, 28 babies were later transferred to Egypt.

BRUSSELS — The European Union’s crisis management chief has welcomed the Israeli hostage release agreement and says the halt in fighting that is part of the deal must be used to flood Gaza with desperately needed aid.

“We hope that the agreement on a pause of hostilities that has just been reached will allow for a substantial surge in humanitarian aid delivery into and within Gaza,” Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic said Wednesday.

“We certainly hope that this will not be a one-off,” he told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France, and called for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses throughout Gaza.”

The 27-nation EU is the world’s biggest aid donor to the Palestinians. Lenarcic said 15 EU aid cargo flights have been sent, with most of that aid already in Gaza, and that more is on the way.

Lenarcic said getting into Gaza is “extremely challenging” and that fewer than 50 trucks a day make it through, a number which he described as “woefully inadequate.” He welcomed Israel’s decision to allow some fuel in, but said it only covers about one third of Gaza’s basic needs.

LONDON — The British government has welcomed an agreement to release some of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza and urged all parties to ensure it is “delivered in full.”

Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the agreement was “a crucial step towards providing relief to the families of the hostages and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.”

“This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis,” he said. “The U.K. will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.”

BEIJING — The Chinese government says it welcomes the four-day truce reached between Israel and Hamas.

“We welcome the provisional truce reached by the parties concerned and hope it will help to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, de-escalate the conflict and ease tensions,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.

China has been calling for a cease-fire and refrained from criticizing the initial Hamas attack on Israel that started the latest conflict. A delegation of foreign ministers from Arab nations and Indonesia held talks with China’s foreign minister this week as they started a tour to press their case for a cease-fire with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.

MOSCOW — The Kremlin on Wednesday hailed a deal between Israel and Hamas for a halt to the war and the release of hostages as step toward ending the hostilities.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the announcement of the deal was “the first good news from Gaza in a long time.”

Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he noted that Russia along with most other countries had called for a truce and humanitarian pauses, adding that “only on the basis of such pauses future attempts to find a lasting settlement to the problem could be made.”

PARIS — France’s foreign minister says she’s hopeful that French nationals will be among the first hostages released as part of a truce deal between Israel and Hamas.

“We hope that French nationals are among them and even, if possible, among the first group that will be released,” the minister, Catherine Colonna, said Wednesday on France Inter radio. “We are working for that.”

France counts eight people missing, some of them confirmed as hostages, from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas militants that ignited their latest and deadliest war. France also counts 40 killed in the attack. Colonna said that not all the hostages taken on Oct. 7 were captured by Hamas. But she said that in the course of negotiations, the militant group has said that “it could assemble together all of the hostages.”

In a message on X, formerly Twitter, Macron said “we are working tirelessly to ensure that all hostages are released.” He also hoped the truce will “enable aid to be brought in” and help the Gaza people.

ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey, a vocal critic of Israel’s actions in Gaza, welcomed the four-day truce as a “positive development to prevent more bloodshed.”

A Foreign Ministry statement released Wednesday said Turkey expects full compliance with the agreement.

“We hope that the humanitarian pause will help permanently end the current conflict as soon as possible and initiate a process towards a just and lasting peace based on a two-state solution,” it said.

BAGHDAD — The United States military said Wednesday that it has carried out strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq that have launched attacks on U.S. forces.

The U.S. Central Command said in a statement Wednesday that its forces had “conducted discrete, precision strikes against two facilities in Iraq … in direct response to the attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces by Iran and Iran-backed groups,” including one on Tuesday involving the use of close-range ballistic missiles.

Two officials with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq said the strikes hit three locations in the area of Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad, killing eight members of the Kataeb Hezbollah militant group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Iranian-backed militants have launched dozens of attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17. While most of the more than five dozen attacks have been ineffective, at least 60 U.S. personnel have reported minor injuries. The militant groups have said the strikes are in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

ROME — Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted a town hall meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday, booing and heckling him when he addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The protesters chanted “Shame on you” and accused Kristersson of supporting genocide after he said Sweden condemns Hamas and supports Israel’s right to self-defense. Police removed some of them from the venue in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second biggest city.

Kristersson criticized the protesters in a Facebook post after the event.

“When we met tonight with a few hundred Gothenburgers the meeting was disrupted by a screaming and shouting group of people who refused to respect everyone else who had come to ask questions,” he wrote. “These political saboteurs appeared to have come to our question-and-answer session only to shout out their anger over Sweden and the EU’s political position about the conflict in the Middle East -– they were particularly disappointed over the condemnation of the terror organization Hamas.”

Kristersson’s center-right government has strongly sided with Israel in the Gaza conflict, condemning Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and supporting Israel’s right to self-defense. Pro-Palestinian groups and the left-leaning opposition have accused the government of ignoring the plight of Palestinian civilians."

The donation was to help Nigeria restrain the outbreak of the disease, particularly in curbing the spread in the most affected communities in the northern part of the country, the EU delegation to Nigeria said in a statement.

Once thought to be under control, diphtheria, a highly contagious bacterial infection that affects a person’s nose, throat, and, sometimes, skin, is resurging in Nigeria. At least 19 Nigerian states out of the 36, including the Federal Capital Territory, are battling the disease.

“Nigeria is currently facing the world’s second-largest diphtheria outbreak with 10,322 confirmed and 16,616 suspected cases since the beginning of the year,” the EU statement said.

The northwestern state of Kano is the epicenter of the outbreak, with over 8,447 confirmed cases and 589 deaths so far in that state alone, the EU said, noting six northern states collectively account for 96 percent of all suspected cases.

Last month, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control confirmed that over 600 people were killed by the disease, which can be curbed through vaccination.

“Despite control efforts since the start of the outbreak in late 2022, the disease has gradually spread to other states in the northwest and northeast regions. Children aged 1 to 14 years represent 72 percent of all confirmed cases,” the EU said.

Analysis of the vaccination status showed that over 60 percent of all suspected cases had not been vaccinated, the statement added."

Russian President Vladimir Putin reframed the Kremlin’s stance on the Israeli-Hamas war to a much more anti-Israel position in an attempt to demonstrate the supposed hypocrisy of Western condemnations of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Putin stated that attendees of the G20 summit who expressed shock at the continued Russian war in Ukraine should instead be “shocked” by the “bloody” 2014 Euromaidan Revolution in Ukraine and the subsequent war that the “Kyiv regime waged against its own people” in Donbas and by the “extermination of the civilian population in Palestine, in the Gaza sector.”[1] Putin’s November 22 statement on the Israel-Hamas war referring to the “extermination of the civilian population of Palestine” was a departure from previous Kremlin framing that largely focused on calling for peace and claiming that the Israel-Hamas war will distract from the provision of Western military aid to Ukraine.[2] Putin’s November 22 framing of the Israeli-Hamas war continues to exploit that war to undermine Western support for Ukraine, as ISW has previously assessed, and also signals potentially increasing support for Iranian interests in the region and an increased willingness to antagonize Israel.[3]

 

 Putin also reiterated boilerplate rhetoric falsely portraying Russia as willing to engage in meaningful negotiations, likely to pressure the West into prematurely pushing Ukraine to negotiate with Russia. Putin stated that the world must “think about how to stop this tragedy [the Russian-initiated war in Ukraine],” falsely signaling a willingness to engage in meaningful peace negotiations in Ukraine.[4] Putin and other Russian officials have routinely falsely claimed that the Kremlin is ready to negotiate to end the war while signaling that the Kremlin maintains its maximalist objectives, including territorial claims and regime change.[5] Kremlin officials have pushed this narrative while claiming that Ukraine is unwilling to negotiate with Russia, likely to coerce Western officials into prematurely offering concessions favorable to Russia rather than engage in meaningful, good faith negotiations.[6] Ukrainian officials have routinely expressed their willingness to negotiate with Russia as soon as Russia removes its forces from Ukraine’s internationally-recognized territory, including Donbas and Crimea.[7] ISW has observed no indications that Putin does not retain his maximalist objectives and continues to assess that a premature cessation of hostilities in Ukraine greatly increases the likelihood of renewed Russian aggression on terms far more favorable to the Kremlin in the near future.[8]

US National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby reported on November 21 that Iran is supplying Russia with glide bombs and that Iran may be preparing to transfer short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.[9] ISW has observed Russian forces increasingly using glide bombs, particularly modified FAB-500, KAB-500, and RPK-500 aerial bombs equipped with glide bomb structures, in the Lyman and Kherson directions.[10] It is unclear whether Kirby meant that Iran is supplying Russia with glide bomb components or with fully constructed glide bombs. The Critical Threats Project (CTP)-ISW’s Iran Update reported on August 14 that Iran produces a variety of glide bombs domestically, such as the Ghaem glide bombs, Yasin long-range glide bombs, Sadid glide bombs, and Balaban glide bombs.[11] Iran commonly uses these bombs with its various drone platforms, likely including the Shahed-131/136 drones that Iran supplies to Russia. A Russian milblogger previously amplified claims that Russian Su-25 aircraft may be compatible with Iranian glide bombs.[12] Iran presented several glide bomb variants at the Russian Army-2023 Forum in Moscow in August 2023 and possibly during Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu’s visit to Tehran in September 2023.[13] Kirby added that Iran also continues to supply Russia with drones and artillery ammunition.[14] Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Deputy Chief Major General Vadym Skibitskyi stated on November 6 that Iran may continue to send small batches of Shahed-131/136 drones to Russia despite increased Russian efforts to produce Shahed drones domestically and Iran’s fulfillment of its first Shahed supply contracts with Russia.[15] CTP-ISW previously assessed that Iran and Russia may conclude a drone and missile sale agreement following the expiration of UN missile restrictions against Iranian missile and missile-related technology exports on October 18, 2023.[16]

The Kremlin appears to be inexplicably concerned about the outcome of the upcoming March 2024 Russian presidential elections, despite apparent widespread Russian approval of Putin. Russian Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairperson Ella Pamfilova stated on November 21 that some Russian citizens who left Russia and others still in Russia have already begun efforts to discredit the upcoming Russian presidential elections.[17] Pamfilova’s statement suggests that the Russian government will continue to intensify censorship efforts under the guise of fighting attempted internal election meddling ahead of the presidential elections. Putin also stated on November 15 that the Russian government will suppress any foreign or domestic election interference at a meeting with Russian election commission representatives.[18] Two unnamed sources from Russian federal and regional authorities told Russian opposition outlet in an article published on November 22 that the Kremlin instructed Russian regional authorities to stop relatives of mobilized personnel from protesting by paying them.[19] The sources added that the Kremlin advised Russian regional governments to “make every effort” to ensure that the governments issue payments to the relatives of mobilized personnel and address other complaints about poor treatment of mobilized personnel in response to rising dissatisfaction among the relatives.[20] The sources also told that the Kremlin considers the relatives of mobilized personnel a social group that may pose one of the greatest threats to the beginning of Putin’s still unannounced presidential campaign.[21]

The Kremlin may also be concerned about a perceived lack of support for Putin from the Russian veteran community.[22] This veteran community is a subsection of the Russian ultranationalist community and has routinely argued in favor of full mobilization and continued Russian offensive operations in Ukraine, as opposed to freezing the current frontlines.[23] The Kremlin’s apparent concern about Putin’s support is odd given that the Levada Center - an independent Russian polling organization - found that 82 percent of Russians approve of Putin's performance as of October 2023.[24] The Kremlin may also want Putin to receive an even higher percentage of the vote and may be attempting to placate specific groups that vocally express dissatisfaction with Putin’s decisions.

Russian Investigative Committee Head Alexander Bastrykin called for Russia to codify an unspecified state ideology in the Russian constitution, suggesting that some Russian officials may want to explicitly end nominal constitutional protections for civil rights, democratic pluralism, and ethnic equality. Bastrykin made the call on November 22 during a conference about the Russian constitution at the Russian Ministry of Justice in Moscow and argued that dismissing his call would not work.[25] Bastrykin previously called on Russian Constitutional Court Chairperson Valery Zorkin to look into ways of establishing an unspecified state ideology in May 2023, although Zorkin rebuffed Bastrykin by noting that the current constitution contains a set of values that protect civil society.[26] The Russian constitution declares that Russia is a democratic state in which Russia’s multinational people should exercise power directly and that the “supreme direct expression” of that power are referendums and free elections.[27] The constitution establishes that the Russian state’s obligation is to recognize, observe, and protect human and civil rights.[28] Article 13 of the Russian constitution notably forbids Russia from proclaiming a state ideology and commits the Russian state to recognize ideological diversity, political diversity, and a multi-party system.[29] Bastrykin's calls would require Russian officials to amend or even repeal Article 13 of the Russian constitution, and possibly would require more extensive amendments depending on the potential new state ideology. Russia adopted its current constitution in 1993 and laid out codified state protections for multiethnic democratic pluralism and human and civil rights to mark a definitive break with the Soviet system of autocratic one-party ideological rule. Bastrykin, who has previously advocated for Stalinist-era domestic policies, may hope that a new ideology enshrined in the Russian constitution would further weaken or outright cancel Russia’s existing constitutional commitment to democratic pluralism and human and civil rights.[30] Bastrykin may be voicing this position on behalf of a wider group of Russian officials wishing to end these nominal constitutional projections, but the Kremlin has shown no indication that it wishes to do away with the veneer of legitimacy that these nominal constitutional protections offer.[31]

Bastrykin has yet to detail what a potential Russian state ideology should be, although the Kremlin’s support for Russian ultranationalism would likely heavily influence any potential Russian state ideology. The Kremlin has heavily courted the Russian ultranationalist community against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, a community that supports Russian imperial goals, efforts to Russify and ethnically cleanse occupied territories, and nationalist demands to protect ethnic Russian communities.[32] The focus on protecting and enforcing the Russian ethnic identity would likely be a key component of any state ideology should the Kremlin entertain Bastrykin’s calls. Bastrykin himself may have had this Russian ultranationalism in mind when he called for a state ideology given that he has heavily sought to capitalize on heightened ethnic tensions in Russia and is increasingly casting himself as a prominent anti-migration figure.[33] Bastrykin and the Russian Investigative Committee have reportedly directly engaged in the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and the forced placement of Ukrainian children into Russian military training programs — parts of a campaign to destroy Ukrainian ethnic identity and Russify Ukraine.[34] The Kremlin’s support for Russian ultranationalism is also heavily focused on promoting Russian Orthodoxy and appeals to “traditional” social values. Putin most recently signed a decree on November 22 declaring 2024 the “Year of the Family” to focus on preserving traditional family values.[35] ISW has previously assessed that the war in Ukraine is likely exacerbating an emerging identity crisis within Russian society resulting from tensions between Russian identity and Russian nationalism.[36] This crisis as well as pronounced ethnoreligious tensions will likely worsen if the ultranationalist Kremlin decides to pursue codifying a state ideology. Putin and elements of the Kremlin, highly aware of the potential for these ethnic, religious, and national tensions to prompt instability and discontent, are unlikely to support Bastrykin’s calls to codify an explicit state ideology in the short term.

reported on November 21 that the European Union (EU) proposed a plan to strengthen security commitments from EU member states to Ukraine.[37] reported, citing a draft proposal, that the EU’s proposal would build on existing bilateral agreements established within the framework of the Group of Seven’s (G7) declaration on security guarantees for Ukraine. The proposal reportedly includes mechanisms for: long-term military aid; training of Ukrainian forces; cooperation with Ukraine’s domestic defense industrial base (DIB); strengthening Ukraine’s ability to counter cyber and hybrid threats; demining assistance; support for Ukraine’s reform agenda as part of the EU accession process; assistance for Ukraine’s energy transition and nuclear safety efforts; and the sharing of intelligence and satellite imagery. EU Foreign Affairs Representative Josep Borrell stated on November 13 that Ukraine is the EU’s top priority and that the EU’s commitment to Ukraine will not waiver.[38] reported that EU member states are expected to consider the EU’s draft proposal in December 2023.

Russian forces conducted a series of missile and drone strikes against Ukraine on the night of November 21 to 22. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces shot down all 14 Shahed-131/136 drones that Russia launched at Ukraine.[39] Ukrainian military officials reported that Russian forces also launched two missiles, of which one Kh-22 cruise missile fell in an unpopulated area in Zaporizhia Oblast.[40] Ukrainian Air Force Spokesperson Colonel Yuriy Ihnat stated on November 21 that Russian forces have paused their use of cruise and ballistic missiles and began using KAB glide bombs and Kh-59 and Kh-31 missiles to conduct strikes against Ukraine.[41]

Russian milbloggers appear to be focusing renewed complaints against the Russian military command for what milbloggers perceive as poor choices that contribute to Russian casualties. Russian milbloggers expressed anger on November 21 and 22 after a Ukrainian HIMARS strike on Kumachove, Donetsk Oblast (37km southeast of Donetsk City and 61km from the frontline) allegedly killed over 25 and injured over 100 personnel of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade (Black Sea Fleet) who were attending a concert for a Russian military holiday on November 19.[42] The milbloggers largely focused on poor security measures, criticizing the Russian command for allowing a large gathering of people within HIMARS range of the frontline in violation of operational security principles.[43] The milbloggers largely called for the Russian military to ban such events and expressed frustration that the Russian military command has not learned this lesson despite nearly two years of war and multiple instances in which publicly available information facilitated Ukrainian strikes.[44]

Though this strike does not affect the battlefield situation in Ukraine, the Russian milbloggers’ reaction to this strike reflects the Russian ultranationalist community’s continued frustration with the Russian military command’s management of the war. Russian milbloggers have recently begun to complain about the Russian military command following a period of self-censorship likely prompted by the death of Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin and the arrests of highly critical Russian ultranationalist milbloggers in summer 2023.[45] The milbloggers’ complaints have largely focused on how the Russian military command’s poor conduct of the war and poor discipline have led to poor treatment of Russian military personnel and casualties instead of focusing on the success or failure of Russian military operations. Russian milbloggers have routinely complained that the Russian military command’s orders to use ""meat assaults” to push Ukrainian forces from positions on the east (left) bank of Kherson Oblast have led to extensive Russian casualties, for example.[46]

Russian forces continued ground attacks along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on November 22 and made a confirmed advance. Geolocated footage published on November 22 indicates that Russian forces made a limited advance east of Synkivka (8km northeast of Kupyansk).[47] A Russian milbloger claimed that Russian forces slightly advanced in the Serebryanske forest area (10km southwest of Kreminna), although ISW has not observed visual evidence of this claim.[48] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces unsuccessfully attacked near Synkivka and Ivanivka (20km southeast of Kupyansk), northeast and east of Petropavlivka (7km east of Kupyansk), and in the direction of Siversk (19km south of Kreminna).[49] Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets assessed that Russian forces in the Kupyansk direction are completing a force regrouping and may soon increase the pace of offensive operations in the area.[50]

Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted unsuccessful ground attacks near Kupyansk and south of Kreminna on November 22. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian attacks near Synkivka and Dibrova (7km southwest of Kreminna).[51] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian attacks near the Serebryanske forest area and Torske (14km west of Kreminna).[52]

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces continued assaults south of Bakhmut on November 22, although Ukrainian forces did not make any confirmed or claimed gains.[53]

Russian forces continued ground attacks near Bakhmut on November 22 but did not make any confirmed advances. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian assaults near Klishchiivka (7km southwest of Bakhmut).[54] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces successfully established a foothold on the northern outskirts of Klishchiivka, although ISW has not observed visual confirmation of this claim.[55] Another Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are assaulting Ukrainian positions on tactical heights near Klishchiivka and near Khromove (immediately west of Bakhmut), and Bohdanivka (6km northwest of Bakhmut).[56] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) posted footage purporting to show elements of the Russian 98th Guards Airborne (VDV) Division operating near Bakhmut.[57] A Russian milblogger claimed that elements of the 119th and 137th VDV Regiments (both of the 106th VDV Division) are also operating in the Bakhmut direction.[58]

Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted unsuccessful ground attacks northwest of Horlivka on November 22. The Russian MoD claimed that elements of the Russian Southern Grouping of Forces repelled a Ukrainian assault near Pivdenne (immediately northwest of Horlivka).[59] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian light infantry assaults near waste heaps northwest of Horlivka.[60] A Russian milblogger claimed that artillery elements of the Russian 132nd Motorized Rifle Brigade (1st Donetsk People's Republic [DNR] Army Corps) repelled Ukrainian attacks northwest of Horlivka.[61]

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian counterattacks northwest of Horlivka near Pivdenne on November 22.[62]

Russian forces intensified offensive operations near Avdiivka and reportedly advanced on Avdiivka’s southeastern outskirts on November 22. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces conducted more than 22 unsuccessful assaults east of Novobakhmutivka (12km northwest of Avdiivka); north of Lastochkyne (5km west of Avdiivka); and near Avdiivka, Sieverne (6km west of Avdiivka), and Pervomaiske (11km southwest of Avdiivka).[63] Ukrainian Tavriisk Group of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Oleksandr Shtupun stated that Russian forces significantly intensified assault operations near Avdiivka and that Ukrainian forces in the area have noted a 25 to 30 percent increase in Russian assaults over the past day.[64] Shtupun stated that Russian forces conducted mechanized assaults with around a dozen armored vehicles in the Avdiivka direction and that Ukrainian forces repelled the assaults, destroying two tanks and seven armored fighting vehicles.[65] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces conducted a successful surprise attack and quickly occupied five buildings in the industrial zone on Avdiivka’s southeastern outskirts.[66] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces also captured Ukrainian defensive fortifications southwest of the industrial zone.[67] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces made unspecified gains near Stepove (3km north of Avdiivka) and that the settlement remains a contested “gray zone.”[68] Shtupun noted that Russian aviation has also intensified operations near Avdiivka, and Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces intensified artillery and air strikes on Ukrainian positions on Avdiivka’s northern and southern flanks.[69] Shtupun stated that weather conditions are not currently impacting the tempo of hostilities in the Avdiivka direction and that reduced foliage in the area due to cold weather is improving Ukrainian visibility against Russian infantry assaults.[70] Ukrainian military observer Konstyantyn Mashovets stated that the Russian command committed elements of the 255th Motorized Rifle Regiment (20th Motorized Rifle Division, 8th Combined Arms Army, Southern Military District) to battles in the Avdiivka direction.[71]

A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces counterattacked north of Avdiivka near Stepove on November 22 but did not specify an outcome.[72]

1142010680,20231123,"London: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol gets down to business Wednesday on the second day of his state visit to Britain, meeting political leaders and signing a new diplomatic accord.

He will later hold talks with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as well as speak to opposition leader Keir Starmer, who is tipped to become Britain's next leader at an election expected in 2024.

Earlier, Yoon addressed a business forum attended by CEOs and other representatives from both countries, which will kickstart talks on a beefed-up UK-South Korea free trade deal.

While meeting Sunak, he will formally agree a new pact -- the ""Downing Street Accord"" -- set to deepen cooperation on technology, defence and security, and ""redefine the relationship"", according to the UK government.

Yoon has said the visit is ""a springboard"" for greater cooperation, with South Korea aiming to expand business opportunities and high-tech industry supply chains as well as bolster diplomatic and defence ties.

Addressing British lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday -- the first day of his three-day visit -- he said their bilateral relations ""will be reborn as true global strategic partners"".

Wednesday's meetings follow the formal royal welcome Yoon and his wife, First Lady Kim Keon Hee, received on their first day, which saw London roll out the red carpet.

King Charles III threw a lavish state banquet at Buckingham Palace -- attended by an array of VIPs, including other UK royals and K-pop stars Blackpink -- to end a packed day of pomp-filled ceremony.

Earlier, the first couple of South Korea enjoyed a private lunch at the palace and visited Westminster Abbey, where Charles was formally crowned monarch six months ago.

Yoon is the first foreign leader hosted by Charles since his May coronation, with the visit coming as Britain forges stronger post-Brexit ties with fast-growing economies in the Indo-Pacific region.

The new accord to be signed Wednesday follows the signing of similar partnerships with Singapore and Japan earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Britain and South Korea are set to broaden cooperation on AI, cybersecurity, nuclear energy and defence, along as working to tackle North Korea's threat, according to Yoon.

The bid to upgrade their free trade arrangements follow the launch last year of a consultation on an enhanced deal.

The existing accord replicates the European Union's agreement with South Korea, and London is eager to showcase the benefits of having left the bloc by striking FTAs with Indo-Pacific nations.

UK Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch launched the talks with her South Korean counterpart at the business forum taking place alongside the state visit.

The two countries are set to announce £21 billion ($26 billion) of investments in green energy and infrastructure projects across the UK at the forum, according to her ministry.

Badenoch said an enhanced deal would boost Britain's vital services sector, while also creating ""new opportunities"" for UK exports in the food and luxury goods sectors.

Total trade in goods and services between the UK and South Korea was £16.1 billion in the year to the end of June.

Defence cooperation will also be part of the new accord, with both countries pledging to step up joint training and operations ""to create the most comprehensive exercise regime between the UK and any partner other than the US"".

The pact comes as North Korea launched what it claims is a spy satellite, Seoul said Tuesday, in Pyongyang's third attempt this year to get a military eye in the sky."
1142012595,20231123,"The European Union announced a review of its development aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip immediately after Hamasterrorists attacked Israel on October 7. After a European Commission meeting in Strasbourg, a decision has now been reached to continue providing development aid. There are no indications that Hamas — deemed a terrorist organization by the EU, the US and others — misappropriated EU funds.

European Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi said that the audit of this year’s payments had not revealed a misuse of funds and that the EU could continue cooperating with various agencies and authorities in the Palestinian territories.

After the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, Varhelyi had initially wanted to stop all payments. This, however, had angered the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell. Consequently, an agreement was reached to audit previous payments.

European Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi initially wanted to stop sending money to the Palestinian territories altogetherImage: Büro des Premierministers des Kosovo Since then, 119 development aid contracts worth €330 million ($358 million) have been reviewed. Non-governmental organizations have been requested to answers additional question with regard to 51 of these contracts. The European Commission has said that seven contracts regarding infrastructure in the Gaza Strip have been suspended due to the ongoing conflict. The EU had earmarked a total of €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) in development aid for the Palestinian territories for the period 2020 to 2024.

Germany to keep providing aid The German government had also said that it would review its development aid to the Palestinian territories. On the sidelines of a meeting of foreign affairs and development ministers in Brussels, Germany’s state secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development Jochen Flasbarth said that the government had so far audited development projects in Gaza and Jordan. He added that Germany would continue its cooperation with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

“The review of other areas is still ongoing, but should be completed soon,” Flasbarth said in reference to the West Bank, which is occupied by Israel and governed by the Palestinian Authority.

It was right to carefully vet all funding programs in light of the serious situation, Flasbarth added. “We have found nothing unusual and have heard from other states that have chosen a similar path that they have also carried out checks and found everything to be above board.”

Stricter funding checks proposed Varhelyi wants to make future development aid conditional on tougher checks. Going forward, there will be checks to see whether aid organizations have made “inflammatory” or antisemitic remarks. There are also plans to check whether families seeking EU welfare payouts for example have engaged in hate speech. So far, this rule only applied to the head of the families in need.

But not everyone agrees with these stricter rules. Some European commissioners at the meeting in Strasbourg said they considered the restrictions exaggerated and unjustified.

Some of the EU funds go towards paying the salaries of Palestinian Authority officials in the West Bank. They also indirectly provide social aid to Gazan families via aid organizations. The EU severed all direct contact with Hamas in 2007.

Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization, with which the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Protestant aid agency Brot für die Welt (Bread for the World) used to cooperate, will no longer receive funds. A spokesperson for the ministry recently said that organizations that supported armed resistance to Israel were not appropriate partners.

Direct humanitarian aid remains unaffected Direct humanitarian aid provided to the Palestinians in the form of food, shelter and medical care, which is distinct from development projects, remains unaffected and the EU is planning to extend this. After the start of Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the bloc would quadruple aid to €100 million ($108 million).

EU member states have granted a further €260 million in urgently needed humanitarian assistance, of which €160 million will be paid for by Germany, according to German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.

The EU has helped finance the construction of schools in GazaImage: picture-alliance/AP Photo/K. Hamra The bloc will also continue to provide funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) , which has been operating in the region for decades and supporting people in the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Two thirds of Gazan were already dependent on UNRWA assistance even before the current war between the Israeli army and Hamas erupted. The UN agency has 13,000 employees in Gaza.

Last year, UNRWA’s largest donors were the US, which supplied $343 million (€315 million), followed by Germany with $202 million (€185 million) and the EU with $114 million (€105 million). The UNRWA budget totaled $1.17 billion (€1 billion) in 2022.

Meanwhile, Belgian Minister of Development Cooperation Caroline Gennez has called for fighting to stop in Gaza, saying that short pauses as proposed by the EU in October are not adequate. “I think it is very clear that the violence should end now,” she said. “There have been too many innocent victims in Gaza and still too many Israeli hostages taken. It is important that the violence stops and humanitarian aid is secured and that one day we start negotiations for a durable tenable two-state-solution.”

France, too, has called for an end to the hostilities.

1142012597,20231123,"Cambodia and the European Union (EU) are committed to fostering cooperation on the development of agriculture and natural resources in Cambodia.

The commitment was made in a meeting between H.E. Dith Tina, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, and a working group of the EU delegation here in Phnom Penh on Nov. 22.

H.E. Dith Tina shared with the EU delegation a new agricultural community policy, which was launched on Nov. 20, adding that the policy needs cooperation and support from development partners as well as other players.

The minister welcomed the EU working group to promote green agri-trade and added value to agricultural products that benefit small-scale farmers.

He also encouraged the EU working group to cooperate and conduct studies on its development projects, especially those in line with the Cambodian government's priorities."
1142012603,20231123,"Israel's national security adviser said late Wednesday that cease-fire talks with the Hamas militant group were still ongoing, and the hostage release will not take place before Friday. Tzachi Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

The cease-fire agreement between the Hamas militant group and Israel had earlier been confirmed by both parties, along with Washington and Qatar, which helped broker the deal that would bring a temporary halt to the devastating war that is now in its seventh week.

The Israeli government said that under an outline of the deal, Hamas will free over a four-day period at least 50 of the roughly 240 hostages taken in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel will release some Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Egyptian state media say the truce will begin Thursday morning. Egypt helped mediate the cease-fire agreement, which would bring the first respite to war-weary Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed, according to health authorities.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Wednesday he told US President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with the war after a cease-fire expires. Some 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, mostly during the initial incursion by Hamas.

Currently: - Truce deal raises hopes of freeing hostages in Gaza and halting worst Mideast violence in decades.

- How the hostage deal came about: Negotiations stumbled, but persistence finally won out.

- Israel unveils what it claims is a major Hamas militant hideout beneath Gaza City's Shifa Hospital.

- The shadowy Hamas leader in Gaza is at the top of Israel's hit list.

- During truce, humanitarians want more aid for Gaza, access to hostages - and more time.

US DESTROYER SHOOTS DOWN BOMB-CARRYING DRONES LAUNCHED FROM HOUTHI-CONTROLLED TERRITORY DUBAI- The United States military says one of its warships in the Red Sea has shot down bomb-carrying drones launched from territory controlled by Yemen's Houthi rebels.

The military arm of Yemen's Houthi rebels said earlier Wednesday that it launched a batch of long-range large missiles toward southern Israel, including the Red Sea city of Eilat. The Iran-backed rebel group has launched at least six aerial attacks against Israel since the conflict broke out on Oct. 7.

The Houthi are staunch foes of Israel and have vowed to continue aerial attacks and hijackings of Israeli ships.

The American military's Central Command said the USS Thomas Hudner, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, shot down the drones early Thursday morning.

“The ship and crew sustained no damage or injury,” Central Command said, but did not identify what it believed the drones were targeting.

ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE IN SOUTH LEBANON BELIEVED TO HAVE KILLED SON OF HEAD OF HEZBOLLAH'S PARLIAMENTARY BLOC BEIRUT - An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon late Wednesday is believed to have killed the son of the head of Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc in Lebanon, Mohammed Raad. Hezbollah announced early Thursday that five of its fighters were killed, among them Abbas Mohammed Raad, identified by local media as the son of the legislator. The Lebanese militant group has a political wing that has long held seats in the country's parliament.

The state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli airstrike on a house in the town of Beit Yahoun late Wednesday killed four people and wounded one. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike.

On Wednesday, Hamas announced that Khalil Kharraz, a commander of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing in Lebanon, was killed in an Israeli airstrike the day before. Also on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike killed two journalists from the pan-Arab TV channel Al Mayadeen as they were reporting in south Lebanon. The Israeli military has said it is looking into the incident.

The Lebanon-Israel border has seen daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. While mostly limited to the border area, the clashes have stirred fears of a wider regional war.

ISRAEL SAYS CEASE-FIRE TALKS ARE ONGOING AND HOSTAGE RELEASE WON'T HAPPEN BEFORE FRIDAY JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's national security adviser says a planned hostage-for-prisoner swap with Hamas has been delayed until at least Friday.

In a statement released late Wednesday, Tzachi Hanegbi said that contacts on the deal were continuing. “The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday,” he said.

The swap is to take place as part of a four-day truce expected to begin on Thursday.

Hanegbi gave no explanation for the delay, and it was not immediately clear when the cease-fire might begin.

NETANYAHU SAYS SPY AGENCY WILL ACT AGAINSt HAMAS LEADERS OVERSEAS JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has instructed the country's Mossad spy agency to track down the leadership of the Hamas militant group living in other countries outside Gaza.

“I have instructed the Mossad to act against the heads of Hamas, wherever they are,” Netanyahu told a news conference.

Most of Hamas' top leadership lives in exile, primarily in the Gulf state of Qatar and the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

The Mossad has been accused in a series of assassinations overseas of Palestinian militants and Iranian nuclear scientists over the years.

OVER A MILLION DISPLACED IN GAZA ARE SHELTERING IN UN FACILITIES CAIRO - The U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday that almost 1,037,000 internally displaced Palestinians were currently seeking shelter in 156 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip.

In its report, the aid agency said that the number of its workers killed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza stands at 108. The information in the report was valid as of Tuesday.

Earlier Wednesday, UNRWA's Secretary General, Philippe Lazzarini, gave a press conference in southern Gaza warning that the suffering of Palestinians will only worsen with the coming of winter, and that the besieged territory is on the verge of a waterborne disease outbreak.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a temporary truce was agreed between Israel and Hamas that will facilitate the release of dozens of people taken hostage during the militant group's assault on Israel on Oct. 7.

The move has been welcomed by UNRWA whose leaders have continually called for a cease-fire.

NETANYAHU VOWS WAR WILL KEEP GOING AFTER CEASE-FIREJERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has told President Joe Biden that he will press ahead with Israel's war against Hamas after a temporary cease-fire expires.

Netanyahu said he delivered the message to Biden in a phone call on Wednesday.

“I want to be clear. The war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals,” Netanyahu said.

A four-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is expected to take effect on Thursday.

Hamas can extend the truce by releasing more of the hostages it is holding.

But Netanyahu, along with the other members of his special war cabinet, told a press conference they will resume the war until Hamas is destroyed and all of the 240 hostages it is holding are released.

ISRAEL RELEASES AWARD-WINNING PALESTINIAN POET WHO WAS DETAINED BY TROOPS IN GAZA JERUSALEM - The Israeli army says it has released an award-winning Palestinian poet it detained in Gaza.

Mosab Abu Toha has been contributing pieces to western media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, painting a dire picture of its toll on civilians through his personal experience.

His family announced Monday that Abu Toha had been arrested while evacuating to southern Gaza from his home in the hard-hit Jabaliya refugee camp. Abu Toha last posted to X on Nov. 15, writing: “Alive. Thanks for your prayers.” Diana Buttu, a former Palestinian peace negotiator and friend of the family, said Abu Toha was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint and held for two days with dozens of other Palestinians at an Israeli detention center. She says he was was accused of having Hamas connections and beaten up in custody. She said he was released on Tuesday, apparently after the case attracted international attention.

The Israeli military said Wednesday that Abu Toha had been released. It gave no further details.

Buttu said Abu Toha was safe in central Gaza after receiving medical treatment. The poet, whose son is an American citizen, is trying to leave the besieged territory.

MASS GRAVE FOR OVER 100 PALESTINIANS DUG IN SOUTHERN GAZA KHAN YOUNIS - More than 100 bodies were buried Wednesday in a mass grave in Khan Younis, the corpses wrapped in blue plastic sheets fastened with cable ties.

Medical workers placed dozens of bodies brought from various areas in northern Gaza, including Shifa Hospital, into a huge trench that was dug using a bulldozer.

Workers wearing surgical masks and gloves carried the bodies to the grave and performed funeral prayers.

AID TRUCKS AT GAZA BORDER AWAIT PAUSE IN FIGHTING GENEVA - International aid groups that have lined up thousands of aid trucks for Gaza say they're ready to move quickly to send in food, water and other supplies during an agreed, but yet undated, pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel.

Details remain unclear about both the mechanics of getting more aid for beleaguered Palestinians in Gaza and the possible release of hostages kidnapped from Israel whose families have desperately sought their release.

“The entire humanitarian sector is ready to scale up once everything is set,” said Tommaso Della Longa, a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to the fine print of the announced deal.

Della Longa lamented bottlenecks that have confounded the scant deliveries of humanitarian aid into Gaza. He said IFRC hopes that a deal would include provisions to allow for a “faster track” of aid shipments.

The only route for international humanitarian aid into Gaza since Oct. 7 has been through the Rafah Crossing into Egypt, and planeloads of supplies have been flown into the nearby Egyptian city of El-Arish - and trucks have queued up near Gaza, where intense Israeli inspections of trucks and cargo have slowed entry.

IRANIAN-BACKED MILITANT GROUP VOWS TO EXPAND CONFLICT IF US AIRSTRIKES CONTINUE WASHINGTON - A major Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq has warned it may strike additional U.S. targets after U.S. warplanes killed multiple militants in response to the first use of short-range ballistic missiles against U.S. forces at Al-Asad Air Base earlier this week.

U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and a Kataib Hezbollah command and control node south of Baghdad on Tuesday, two defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide additional sensitive details of the attacks.

There were Kataib Hezbollah personnel at both sites at the time of the strikes, but the officials said they could not yet confirm whether anyone there was killed.

Militia officials in Iraq said the attack had killed eight Kataib Hezbollah members.

Kataib Hezbollah said in a statement Wednesday that it was considering “expanding the scope of targets” if the U.S. military continues with its strikes, adding that the attack “will not go unpunished.” The dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities on Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. The attacks have continued unabated since, with at least 66 rocket and missile attacks hitting U.S. facilities and wounding at least 62 service members.

___ SWISS PARLIAMENT TO CONSIDER BAN ON HAMAS GENEVA - Switzerland's executive branch said Wednesday it will ask parliament to ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The Federal Council said the government will also end contracts it has with three Palestinian non-governmental organizations. They were among 11 Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that had been under review by Swiss officials following Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.

Four days after the deadly rampage in Israel, the council moved to designate Hamas as a terrorist group and instructed the Foreign Ministry to consider a possible ban.

The seven-member council, which includes the Swiss president, reiterated its condemnation of the attacks “in the strongest possible terms” and expressed its regret about the deaths of thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict.

The United States and the European Union, which does not count Switzerland as a member, have long considered Hamas a terrorist organization.

EGYPTIAN MEDIA SAY TRUCE WILL BEGIN THURSDAY MORNING Egypt's state-run Qahera TV says the Israel-Hamas truce will take effect at 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT) Thursday. Egypt helped mediate the four-day cease-fire, which will facilitate the release of dozens of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. The deal will also see the release of dozens of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the entry of more humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israeli media also reported that the truce would begin Thursday at 10 a.m. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTS 178 ATTACKS ON GAZA HEATH CARE FACILITIES CAIRO - The World Health Organization has documented 178 attacks on healthcare facilities that killed 553 people, including 22 healthcare workers, since the war started on Oct. 7, the agency's regional director said Wednesday.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari said in an online briefing that about 800 people, including 48 healthcare workers, were injured in the attacks, which damaged 24 hospitals and 32 ambulances.

The war has forced the shutdown of 27 out of 36 hospitals and 47 out of 72 primary health care clinics across Gaza, he said. The facilities stopping providing services mainly because of a lack of fuel and attacks, he said.

“Hospitals must be allowed to replenish the resources they need to continue functioning,” he said. “We cannot keep providing drops of aid in an ocean of needs.” A WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION STAFF MEMBER AND HER FAMILY ARE KILLED IN STRIKE CAIRO - The World Health Organization says one of its local staff members in Gaza was killed along with her family when a strike hit the home where they were sheltering.

It said Dima Abdullatif Mohammed Alhaj, 29, was killed Tuesday along with her husband, their 6-month-old son and her two brothers.

The U.N. health agency said in a statement late Tuesday that over 50 people were reportedly killed in the strike. It was not immediately possible to confirm the report or to determine who carried out the strike.

Israel has launched airstrikes across Gaza in the war triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. Palestinian militants have fired rockets at Israel, some of which have fallen short.

Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO's representative for the Palestinian territories, said Alhaj “was a wonderful person with a radiant smile, cheerful, positive, respectful. She was a true team player.” Alhaj, who had worked as a patient administrator with WHO since 2019, was among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled from northern Gaza to shelter in the south. She had left her home in Gaza City and was staying with relatives.

WHO said her death “is another example of the senseless loss in this conflict.'' POPE BEGS FOR PEACE AND AN END TO TERRORISM' VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has met separately with Israeli and Palestinian delegations and begged for peace and an end to what he called terrorism and “passions that are killing everyone.” In encounters arranged before the Israeli-Hamas hostage deal was announced, Francis met Wednesday with relatives of hostages held in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 raid in southern Israel. And he met separately with a delegation of Palestinians with relatives in Gaza.

Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said he heard from both how much they are suffering and the toll that the war was taking. In the audience were people holding Palestinian flags and scarves as well as small posters showing apparent bodies in a ditch and the word “Genocide” written underneath.

Francis said: “Here we've gone beyond war. This isn't war, this is terrorism. Please, let us go forward for peace. Pray for peace, pray a lot for peace.”"

Russian President Vladimir Putin reframed the Kremlin’s stance on the Israeli-Hamas war to a much more anti-Israel position in an attempt to demonstrate the supposed hypocrisy of Western condemnations of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Putin stated that attendees of the G20 summit who expressed shock at the continued Russian war in Ukraine should instead be “shocked” by the “bloody” 2014 Euromaidan Revolution in Ukraine and the subsequent war that the “Kyiv regime waged against its own people” in Donbas and by the “extermination of the civilian population in Palestine, in the Gaza sector.”[1] Putin’s November 22 statement on the Israel-Hamas war referring to the “extermination of the civilian population of Palestine” was a departure from previous Kremlin framing that largely focused on calling for peace and claiming that the Israel-Hamas war will distract from the provision of Western military aid to Ukraine.[2] Putin’s November 22 framing of the Israeli-Hamas war continues to exploit that war to undermine Western support for Ukraine, as ISW has previously assessed, and also signals potentially increasing support for Iranian interests in the region and an increased willingness to antagonize Israel.[3]

Putin also reiterated boilerplate rhetoric falsely portraying Russia as willing to engage in meaningful negotiations, likely to pressure the West into prematurely pushing Ukraine to negotiate with Russia. Putin stated that the world must “think about how to stop this tragedy [the Russian-initiated war in Ukraine],” falsely signaling a willingness to engage in meaningful peace negotiations in Ukraine.[4] Putin and other Russian officials have routinely falsely claimed that the Kremlin is ready to negotiate to end the war while signaling that the Kremlin maintains its maximalist objectives, including territorial claims and regime change.[5] Kremlin officials have pushed this narrative while claiming that Ukraine is unwilling to negotiate with Russia, likely to coerce Western officials into prematurely offering concessions favorable to Russia rather than engage in meaningful, good faith negotiations.[6] Ukrainian officials have routinely expressed their willingness to negotiate with Russia as soon as Russia removes its forces from Ukraine’s internationally-recognized territory, including Donbas and Crimea.[7] ISW has observed no indications that Putin does not retain his maximalist objectives and continues to assess that a premature cessation of hostilities in Ukraine greatly increases the likelihood of renewed Russian aggression on terms far more favorable to the Kremlin in the near future.[8]

US National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby reported on November 21 that Iran is supplying Russia with glide bombs and that Iran may be preparing to transfer short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.[9] ISW has observed Russian forces increasingly using glide bombs, particularly modified FAB-500, KAB-500, and RPK-500 aerial bombs equipped with glide bomb structures, in the Lyman and Kherson directions.[10] It is unclear whether Kirby meant that Iran is supplying Russia with glide bomb components or with fully constructed glide bombs. The Critical Threats Project (CTP)-ISW’s Iran Update reported on August 14 that Iran produces a variety of glide bombs domestically, such as the Ghaem glide bombs, Yasin long-range glide bombs, Sadid glide bombs, and Balaban glide bombs.[11] Iran commonly uses these bombs with its various drone platforms, likely including the Shahed-131/136 drones that Iran supplies to Russia. A Russian milblogger previously amplified claims that Russian Su-25 aircraft may be compatible with Iranian glide bombs.[12] Iran presented several glide bomb variants at the Russian Army-2023 Forum in Moscow in August 2023 and possibly during Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu’s visit to Tehran in September 2023.[13] Kirby added that Iran also continues to supply Russia with drones and artillery ammunition.[14] Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Deputy Chief Major General Vadym Skibitskyi stated on November 6 that Iran may continue to send small batches of Shahed-131/136 drones to Russia despite increased Russian efforts to produce Shahed drones domestically and Iran’s fulfillment of its first Shahed supply contracts with Russia.[15] CTP-ISW previously assessed that Iran and Russia may conclude a drone and missile sale agreement following the expiration of UN missile restrictions against Iranian missile and missile-related technology exports on October 18, 2023.[16]

The Kremlin appears to be inexplicably concerned about the outcome of the upcoming March 2024 Russian presidential elections, despite apparent widespread Russian approval of Putin. Russian Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairperson Ella Pamfilova stated on November 21 that some Russian citizens who left Russia and others still in Russia have already begun efforts to discredit the upcoming Russian presidential elections.[17] Pamfilova’s statement suggests that the Russian government will continue to intensify censorship efforts under the guise of fighting attempted internal election meddling ahead of the presidential elections. Putin also stated on November 15 that the Russian government will suppress any foreign or domestic election interference at a meeting with Russian election commission representatives.[18] Two unnamed sources from Russian federal and regional authorities told Russian opposition outlet Verstka in an article published on November 22 that the Kremlin instructed Russian regional authorities to stop relatives of mobilized personnel from protesting by paying them.[19] The sources added that the Kremlin advised Russian regional governments to “make every effort” to ensure that the governments issue payments to the relatives of mobilized personnel and address other complaints about poor treatment of mobilized personnel in response to rising dissatisfaction among the relatives.[20] The sources also told Verstka that the Kremlin considers the relatives of mobilized personnel a social group that may pose one of the greatest threats to the beginning of Putin’s still unannounced presidential campaign.[21]

The Kremlin may also be concerned about a perceived lack of support for Putin from the Russian veteran community.[22] This veteran community is a subsection of the Russian ultranationalist community and has routinely argued in favor of full mobilization and continued Russian offensive operations in Ukraine, as opposed to freezing the current frontlines.[23] The Kremlin’s apparent concern about Putin’s support is odd given that the Levada Center - an independent Russian polling organization - found that 82 percent of Russians approve of Putin's performance as of October 2023.[24] The Kremlin may also want Putin to receive an even higher percentage of the vote and may be attempting to placate specific groups that vocally express dissatisfaction with Putin’s decisions.

Russian Investigative Committee Head Alexander Bastrykin called for Russia to codify an unspecified state ideology in the Russian constitution, suggesting that some Russian officials may want to explicitly end nominal constitutional protections for civil rights, democratic pluralism, and ethnic equality. Bastrykin made the call on November 22 during a conference about the Russian constitution at the Russian Ministry of Justice in Moscow and argued that dismissing his call would not work.[25] Bastrykin previously called on Russian Constitutional Court Chairperson Valery Zorkin to look into ways of establishing an unspecified state ideology in May 2023, although Zorkin rebuffed Bastrykin by noting that the current constitution contains a set of values that protect civil society.[26] The Russian constitution declares that Russia is a democratic state in which Russia’s multinational people should exercise power directly and that the “supreme direct expression” of that power are referendums and free elections.[27] The constitution establishes that the Russian state’s obligation is to recognize, observe, and protect human and civil rights.[28] Article 13 of the Russian constitution notably forbids Russia from proclaiming a state ideology and commits the Russian state to recognize ideological diversity, political diversity, and a multi-party system.[29] Bastrykin's calls would require Russian officials to amend or even repeal Article 13 of the Russian constitution, and possibly would require more extensive amendments depending on the potential new state ideology. Russia adopted its current constitution in 1993 and laid out codified state protections for multiethnic democratic pluralism and human and civil rights to mark a definitive break with the Soviet system of autocratic one-party ideological rule. Bastrykin, who has previously advocated for Stalinist-era domestic policies, may hope that a new ideology enshrined in the Russian constitution would further weaken or outright cancel Russia’s existing constitutional commitment to democratic pluralism and human and civil rights.[30] Bastrykin may be voicing this position on behalf of a wider group of Russian officials wishing to end these nominal constitutional projections, but the Kremlin has shown no indication that it wishes to do away with the veneer of legitimacy that these nominal constitutional protections offer.[31]

Bastrykin has yet to detail what a potential Russian state ideology should be, although the Kremlin’s support for Russian ultranationalism would likely heavily influence any potential Russian state ideology. The Kremlin has heavily courted the Russian ultranationalist community against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, a community that supports Russian imperial goals, efforts to Russify and ethnically cleanse occupied territories, and nationalist demands to protect ethnic Russian communities.[32] The focus on protecting and enforcing the Russian ethnic identity would likely be a key component of any state ideology should the Kremlin entertain Bastrykin’s calls. Bastrykin himself may have had this Russian ultranationalism in mind when he called for a state ideology given that he has heavily sought to capitalize on heightened ethnic tensions in Russia and is increasingly casting himself as a prominent anti-migration figure.[33] Bastrykin and the Russian Investigative Committee have reportedly directly engaged in the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and the forced placement of Ukrainian children into Russian military training programs — parts of a campaign to destroy Ukrainian ethnic identity and Russify Ukraine.[34] The Kremlin’s support for Russian ultranationalism is also heavily focused on promoting Russian Orthodoxy and appeals to “traditional” social values. Putin most recently signed a decree on November 22 declaring 2024 the “Year of the Family” to focus on preserving traditional family values.[35] ISW has previously assessed that the war in Ukraine is likely exacerbating an emerging identity crisis within Russian society resulting from tensions between Russian identity and Russian nationalism.[36] This crisis as well as pronounced ethnoreligious tensions will likely worsen if the ultranationalist Kremlin decides to pursue codifying a state ideology. Putin and elements of the Kremlin, highly aware of the potential for these ethnic, religious, and national tensions to prompt instability and discontent, are unlikely to support Bastrykin’s calls to codify an explicit state ideology in the short term.

Bloomberg reported on November 21 that the European Union (EU) proposed a plan to strengthen security commitments from EU member states to Ukraine.[37] Bloomberg reported, citing a draft proposal, that the EU’s proposal would build on existing bilateral agreements established within the framework of the Group of Seven’s (G7) declaration on security guarantees for Ukraine. The proposal reportedly includes mechanisms for: long-term military aid; training of Ukrainian forces; cooperation with Ukraine’s domestic defense industrial base (DIB); strengthening Ukraine’s ability to counter cyber and hybrid threats; demining assistance; support for Ukraine’s reform agenda as part of the EU accession process; assistance for Ukraine’s energy transition and nuclear safety efforts; and the sharing of intelligence and satellite imagery. EU Foreign Affairs Representative Josep Borrell stated on November 13 that Ukraine is the EU’s top priority and that the EU’s commitment to Ukraine will not waiver.[38] Bloomberg reported that EU member states are expected to consider the EU’s draft proposal in December 2023.

Russian forces conducted a series of missile and drone strikes against Ukraine on the night of November 21 to 22. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces shot down all 14 Shahed-131/136 drones that Russia launched at Ukraine.[39] Ukrainian military officials reported that Russian forces also launched two missiles, of which one Kh-22 cruise missile fell in an unpopulated area in Zaporizhia Oblast.[40] Ukrainian Air Force Spokesperson Colonel Yuriy Ihnat stated on November 21 that Russian forces have paused their use of cruise and ballistic missiles and began using KAB glide bombs and Kh-59 and Kh-31 missiles to conduct strikes against Ukraine.[41]

Russian milbloggers appear to be focusing renewed complaints against the Russian military command for what milbloggers perceive as poor choices that contribute to Russian casualties. Russian milbloggers expressed anger on November 21 and 22 after a Ukrainian HIMARS strike on Kumachove, Donetsk Oblast (37km southeast of Donetsk City and 61km from the frontline) allegedly killed over 25 and injured over 100 personnel of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade (Black Sea Fleet) who were attending a concert for a Russian military holiday on November 19.[42] The milbloggers largely focused on poor security measures, criticizing the Russian command for allowing a large gathering of people within HIMARS range of the frontline in violation of operational security principles.[43] The milbloggers largely called for the Russian military to ban such events and expressed frustration that the Russian military command has not learned this lesson despite nearly two years of war and multiple instances in which publicly available information facilitated Ukrainian strikes.[44]

Though this strike does not affect the battlefield situation in Ukraine, the Russian milbloggers’ reaction to this strike reflects the Russian ultranationalist community’s continued frustration with the Russian military command’s management of the war. Russian milbloggers have recently begun to complain about the Russian military command following a period of self-censorship likely prompted by the death of Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin and the arrests of highly critical Russian ultranationalist milbloggers in summer 2023.[45] The milbloggers’ complaints have largely focused on how the Russian military command’s poor conduct of the war and poor discipline have led to poor treatment of Russian military personnel and casualties instead of focusing on the success or failure of Russian military operations. Russian milbloggers have routinely complained that the Russian military command’s orders to use ""meat assaults” to push Ukrainian forces from positions on the east (left) bank of Kherson Oblast have led to extensive Russian casualties, for example.[46]

1142016262,20231123,"AS the world concludes plans for the United Nations Climate Conference (COP28), the Minister of Environment, Balarabe Abbas Lawal, received a European Union (EU) delegation led by EU Ambassador to Nigeria, Samuela Isopi. The meeting was part of efforts to establish areas of collaboration between Nigeria and European countries ahead of COP28 and to understand the support Nigeria will receive in implementing climate action.

At the meeting, the minister stated that “Nigeria’s dedication to combating climate change is unwavering, and I am thankful to the European Ambassadors who registered their commitment to collaborate with Nigeria in improving renewable energy capacity and push for the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

“Our cooperation will extend beyond COP28. We are happy to continue to work jointly and assiduously in combating climate change.”

Meanwhile, the Environment Minister of State, Dr Iziaq Salako, at the ECOWAS Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) coordination meeting in Abuja on Monday, stated that the Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Ministry of Environment, is committed to ratifying BBNJ treaty in line with the focus of President Bola Tinubu to pursue development by unlocking the energy and natural resources of the nation in a sustainable manner.

He noted that biodiversity loss and climate change should no longer be seen as two different problems. “They are part of the same crisis, and we cannot solve one without solving the other.”

He stated that “The status of the world’s oceans today is a clear indication of this dire interaction.

“Our oceans are under threat today more than ever before with sea level rise, temperature increases, acidification, pollution, biodiversity loss, unsustainable exploitation of marine resources, depletion of fish stocks, the near disappearance of coral reefs, and the destruction of fragile ecosystems.

“The urgent need to address this threat has led Nigeria and its sister ECOWAS member nations to unite and call on the international community to be more ambitious in its response. Our appeal for an ambitious global response to the biodiversity crisis is urgent and focused.”

He added that “With the adoption of the high-seas treaty last June, we are one step closer to achieving our goals. In September this year, at the High Ambition for the High Seas event on the sideline of UNGA, Nigeria joined other 22 countries to symbolically sign a commitment to ratify the BBNJ treaty. We must now rally to ratify the new high-seas treaty promptly so it can come into force.”"
1142018060,20231123,"Yves here. As I regularly stress, Simon Watkins regularly provided early and important intelligence about developments in the oil and gas industry, particularly in the Middle East, along with comments on their geopolitical importance. However, as you can see here, Watkins also brings a lot of Cold War baggage along with him. Regardless of what greater designs one attributes to China and Russia, it’s a remarkable proof of US failure that they are becoming major gas development partners with Iraq after our hugely expensive wars and aftermath there.

By Simon Watkins, a former senior FX trader and salesman, financial journalist, and best-selling author. He was Head of Forex Institutional Sales and Trading for Credit Lyonnais, and later Director of Forex at Bank of Montreal. He was then Head of Weekly Publications and Chief Writer for Business Monitor International, Head of Fuel Oil Products for Platts, and Global Managing Editor of Research for Renaissance Capital in Moscow.

• Russia and China are positioning to benefit from Iraq’s sixth gas licensing round.
• The huge Akkas gas field and the surrounding area are absolutely crucial in Iraq’s strategic plan for natural gas.
• The field itself has around 5.6 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves, and Iraq’s Oil Ministry plans for it to produce around 400 million cubic feet per day of gas.

Any major project connected to Iraq’s oil and gas sector has an incalculably greater significance than just extracting oil or gas. Situated in the heart of the Middle East, sharing its eastern border with Iran, its northern border with Turkey, its western border with Syria and Jordan, and its southern border with Saudi Arabia, Iraq is perhaps the single most geopolitically important country to Russia, China, and the U.S. in the entire region. In turn, the lawless western desert province of Anbar is perhaps the most geopolitically vital area in all of Iraq. And the most strategically important position in Anbar is the huge Akkas gas field. It is little wonder, then, that Russia and China have been angling for the best position to benefit from Iraq’s sixth gas licensing round, centre stage of which will be the bidding for the giant Akkas gas field and its surrounding area.

The field itself has around 5.6 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves, and Iraq’s Oil Ministry plans for it to produce around 400 million cubic feet per day of gas. But that is not the point at all – it could have nothing in it, and Russia and China would still do anything to get it. One core reason is that oil and gas companies are legally entitled to secure their oil and/or gas field operations around the world through whatever means they feel necessary. In practical terms, this can include stationing a massive heavily-armed security force around an oil and/or gas field. Such a site can also house anyone else that the company wishes, in whatever job function they care to label them. In China’s case, this link between the corporate world and the state is explicit. For the many national-level state firms (and virtually all others), board directors and company executives are under the standing instruction to ‘execute the will of the Central Committee of the China Communist Party’. A similar directive applies to Russian state companies. In the West, the links between the corporate world and the state are much less direct. In sum, though, the outcome is largely the same: an oil and/or gas field exploration and development site anywhere in the world can effectively be regarded as part of the country of the company that operates it, not as part of the country in which it is geographically situated.

For China, then, a growing presence in Iraq brings several significant advantages to its overarching plan to act as – at least – the global superpower counterpoint to the U.S. One of these, as reiterated recently in the Iraq Cabinet meeting that gave its full support to rolling out all aspects of the ‘Iraq-China Framework Agreement’ signed in December 2021, is plentiful cheap oil, gas, and petrochemicals. This agreement is very similar in scope and scale to the all-encompassing ‘Iran-China 25-Year Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement’, as first revealed anywhere in the world in my 3 September 2019 article on the subject and fully examined in my new book on the new global oil market order. A key part of both deals is that China has first refusal on all oil, gas, and petrochemicals projects that come up in Iraq for the duration of the deal, and that it is given at least a 30 percent discount on all oil, gas, and petrochemicals it buys. Another key part of the Iraq-China Framework Agreement is that Beijing is allowed to build factories across the country, with a corollary build-out of supportive infrastructure. This includes – importantly for its ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ – railway and other transport and logistical links, all overseen by its own management staff from Chinese companies on the ground in Iraq.

For Russia, the stakes are even higher. Iraq – under the enduring influence of Iran – is a key part of the Shia Crescent countries over which Moscow extends its influence across the Middle East, as also analysed in depth in my new book. This augments the geopolitical power it wields in and around its Former Soviet Union (FSU) satellite states. Already in a controlling position in all key countries in the Shia Crescent of power in the Middle East – Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen (via Iran) – Russia continues to work on those countries on the edges of the Crescent in which it already directly or indirectly had a foothold. These include Azerbaijan (75% Shia and an FSU state) and Turkey (25% Shia and furious at not being accepted fully into the European Union). Others also remain longer-term targets, including Bahrain (75% Shia) and Pakistan (up to 25% Shia and previously a sanctuary to sworn-U.S. enemies Al Qaeda and the Taliban). Iraq is the vital link for Russia, then, between Iran (over which it has significant control, along with China) and Syria – the biggest country on the western side of the Shia Crescent.

The Akkas gas field itself is one of three big gas fields that form a skewed triangle across southern Iraq, stretching from the Mansuriya field near the eastern border with Iran, down to Siba field in the south (extremely close to the key Iraqi Basra export hub), and then all the way west across to Akkas itself (extremely close to the border with Syria). Russia thought it had finally gained control over these three sites when in September 2019 its Stroytransgaz signed a preliminary contract with Iraq’s Oil Ministry to develop the hitherto virtually unknown Block 17 in Iraq’s lawless wasteland Anbar province, as also analysed in depth in my new book. A place so violent and unpredictable that it was even avoided where possible by Islamic State, the Block 17 site in Anbar province was perfect for Russia’s purposes, as it was right in the middle of what the U.S. military used to call ‘the spine’ of Islamic State where the Euphrates flows westwards into Syria and eastwards into the Persian Gulf, extremely close to the border with Iran.

Along the spine running from east to west are the historical ultra-nationalist and ultra-anti-West cities of Falluja, Ramadi, Hit and Haditha, and then Iraq turns into Syria, and it is just a short hop to the key strategic ports of Banias and Tartus, and to Latakia – all three of which are crucial globally strategic sites for Moscow. The Syrian port of Tartus remains a huge naval base for Russia and the only Mediterranean port it has access to. The port is just a short ride from Khmeimim airport, which – under a deal struck in 2015 – became a dual-use civilian-military airport-airbase for use by Russia. And just a short flight away from those two key assets is Russia’s Latakia intelligence-gathering listening station. Meanwhile, Banias had long been earmarked as the end point for the long-planned Iran-Iraq-Syria pipelines that would move Iranian, and later Iraqi, oil and gas from Iran through Iraq to Syria, and then into the less rigorously policed ports of southern Europe. This route would not only allow for the movement of sanctioned Iranian oil and gas into Europe, but also of anything else that Russia and Iran want to get into the continent without too many checks. This has long been the final part of Russian and Iranian plans to build a ‘land bridge’ from Tehran to the Mediterranean Sea by which they could exponentially increase the scale and scope of weapons delivery into southern Lebanon and the Golan Heights area of Syria to be used in attacks on Israel, as also analysed in depth in my new book on the new global oil market order. This core aim of this policy was to provoke a broader conflict in the Middle East that would draw in the U.S. and its allies into an unwinnable war of the sort seen recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.

It should come as no surprise, then, that – according to a source who works closely with Iraq’s Oil Ministry spoken to exclusively by OilPrice.com last week – Russia has now received assurances from the Iraqi government that it will be awarded an exploratory and production licence for the Akkas gas field. The enormous pressure that Russia brought to bear on Baghdad, both through its activities in the south of the country and through its tight grip over Kurdistan’s oil and gas sector in the north, was augmented by heavy lobbying of Iraq’s Oil Ministry from elements of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, added the source. “So the Russian licence will allow its chosen companies to subcontract parts of the contract for periods of 5-10 years during the 20-year license period, and this will heavily feature Chinese companies,” he concluded."

During the meeting, views were exchanged on the issues of the comprehensive agenda of Armenia-EU partnership. The interlocutors touched upon the steps being taken to further deepen the political dialogue between Armenia and the EU, as well as the prospects for further development of mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields.

Among other things, the interlocutors touched upon holding of the second high-level Armenia-EU Political and Security Dialogue last week in Brussels, the activities of the EU monitoring mission in Armenia, as well as the EU's consistent support to the reform agenda of Armenia and strengthening of democratic institutions, in accordance with the joint statement of October 5 by the Prime Minister of Armenia and the President of the European Commission.

In the context of the implementation of the Armenia-EU Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement and the intensification of people to people contacts, Minister Mirzoyan stressed the importance of directing positive dynamics towards the final decision to start the visa liberalization dialogue.

Regional security issues were discussed at the meeting. Ararat Mirzoyan presented Armenia's vision for the establishment of stability and lasting peace in the region. The Minister emphasized that it is based on the fundamental principles that were also reflected in the statement adopted after the quadrilateral meeting within the framework of the European political Community in Granada in October, and relate to mutual recognition of territorial integrity, border delimitation and unblocking of regional communications.

Ararat Mirzoyan briefed the EU Ambassadors on the project of ""Crossroads of Peace"" developed by the Government of Armenia which is based on the vision of effective unblocking communications and creation of beneficial interconnections in the region; it can also become a guarantee for peace.

Touching upon the large-scale military attack of Azerbaijan against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh in September and the resulting complete ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh, Minister Mirzoyan stressed in particular the imperative to address the needs and rights of the forcibly displaced Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, and the steps taken in that direction."

Details: A Russian military blogger claimed that Russian troops had made some progress near Serebrianka Forest (10 kilometres southwest of Kreminna), although the ISW found no visual evidence of this claim.

General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that Russian forces conducted unsuccessful attacks near Synkivka and Ivanivka (20 kilometres southeast of Kupiansk), northeast and east of Petropavlivka (7 kilometres east of Kupiansk), and towards Siversk (19 kilometres south of Kreminna).

In addition, Ukrainian military expert Kostiantyn Mashovets estimated that Russian troops are completing the regrouping of forces and may soon increase the pace of offensive actions on the Kupiansk front.

• None Russian Investigative Committee Head Alexander Bastrykin called for Russia to codify an unspecified state ideology in the Russian constitution, suggesting that some Russian officials may want to explicitly end nominal constitutional protections for civil rights, democratic pluralism, and ethnic equality.
• None Bastrykin has yet to detail what a potential Russian state ideology should be, although the Kremlin’s support for Russian ultranationalism would likely heavily influence any potential Russian state ideology.
• None Bloomberg reported on 21 November that the European Union (EU) proposed a plan to strengthen security commitments from EU member states to Ukraine.
• None Russian forces conducted a series of missile and drone strikes against Ukraine on the night of 21-22 November.
• None Russian milbloggers appear to be focusing renewed complaints against the Russian military command for what milbloggers perceive as poor choices that contribute to Russian casualties.
• None Russian forces continued offensive operations along the Kupiansk-Svatove-Kreminna line, near Bakhmut, northwest of Horlivka, near Avdiivka, west and southwest of Donetsk City, in the Donetsk-Zaporizhzhia Oblast border area, in western Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast and advanced east of Synkivka.

1142041575,20231123,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau kicked off a two-day summit with the top two heads of the European Union on Thursday night in a small brewpub on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean in Newfoundland and Labrador's capital city of St. John's.

Though formal discussions with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to begin Friday, Trudeau wasted no time making announcements during his summit-opening speech on Thursday night.

He said Canada is joining the European Union's $100-billion scientific research program, called Horizon Europe, which he called ""the greatest research and innovation mechanism in the world right now."" Canada has also worked out a deal to build water bombers and ship them to the EU, after both regions faced devastating forest fires this past summer, Trudeau told the crowd at the Quidi Vidi Brewery.

""These are the kinds of things that friends can do when they come together,"" he said, describing Canada and the EU as ""some of the best friends in the world.""

""As we talk about the transatlantic partnership, what better place to dig into it than a rock in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean?"" he added.

This year's EU-Canada Summit in St. John's is the 19th such meeting between Canada's prime minister and the heads of the bloc of 27 countries. The meetings are held every two years, and the last summit took place in Brussels in 2021.

The summit comes as wars rage in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, and both Trudeau and Michel spoke of the unrest on Thursday. Michel said Canada and the EU have long shared the same values about democracy, dignity and freedom, and the ongoing violence underscored the need for the two countries to work together on issues from peace and security to fighting climate change.

""We are not separated by an ocean, we are connected by this ocean,"" Michel said.

A group of about two dozen pro-Palestinian protesters lined the narrow street outside the building, waving Palestinian flags and chanting ""Ceasefire now!"" Canada has called for ""humanitarian pauses"" in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, though the Liberals have been under sustained pressure from humanitarian organizations, Muslim groups and even some of their MPs to endorse calls for a ceasefire.

Hydrogen energy will also be a big topic of discussion, as Atlantic Canada angles to become a major supplier of hydrogen fuel to European markets, particularly Germany, Trudeau said.

A man at the helm of that effort was among the crowd watching Trudeau's speech. Seafood tycoon John Risley is aiming to build a massive wind-powered hydrogen and ammonia production facility in western Newfoundland with his company, World Energy GH2. He helped bring German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to western Newfoundland last year to sign an agreement with Trudeau to build a hydrogen energy partnership.

Risley said he's looking for the Europeans to ante up. Canada, he said, has come up with programs and loans to back hydrogen developments, including a clean hydrogen investment tax credit. Risley also estimates his company will invest about $250 million into its project before he and his co-directors are ready to make a final investment decision.

He said now it's Europe's turn to make a solid, substantial investment to help move the hydrogen partnership along. Ideally, a country like Germany would announce a program that would help support one of its large industries, like steel production, transition to hydrogen energy, he added.

""Because industry isn't going to make the switch if they don't get some help,"" Risley said.

He said it's ""scary"" to be at the precipice of a new energy industry, waiting for action from slow-moving governments with so much of his own money at stake.

""But on the other hand, it's very exciting because we're standing up a whole new industry that could be huge,"" he said. Atlantic Canada has a ""natural right"" to lead a global transition from fossil fuels to hydrogen, he added.

""We've got the wind,"" Risley said. ""The wind blows more often than the sun shines. So let's take advantage.""

Trudeau is expected to hold formal meetings on Friday with Michel and von der Leyen.

1142044105,20231123,"Argentine President-elect, Javier Miley, offered to Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, to host a peace summit on the war. This was announced by Diana Mondino, head of foreign policy for her party, La Libertad Avanza. “We aim to function as a headquarters, if possible,” Mondino told the media at the Hotel Libertador, Miley’s headquarters, for weeks. The Ukrainian President thanked Miley for the “clear support”: “There is no ambiguity between good and evil. Just clear support for Ukraine. “We Ukrainians realize this and appreciate it very much,” Zelensky said. The relationship between Latin American countries and the Ukrainian government has been complicated since the beginning of the war. Kiev has invited leaders such as Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to visit the country on numerous occasions, but he has not done so so far.

“I think Putin participated in the G20 because it was easy to do so via video without leaving Moscow, and for him it was an opportunity to make political appearances, not to do propaganda but to defend his positions.” Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said this in joint statements with Chancellor Olaf Scholz as part of the Italian-German Ministerial Summit. “As for the fact that Russia, as Putin said, wants to work for peace, this – added the Prime Minister – pleases me, but if it wants peace it will be enough to withdraw the troops, and we must not forget that there is a solution.” The aggressor and the person being attacked.”

(Marta Serafini, sent to OdessaVladimir Putin immediately took advantage of his virtual participation in the G20 summit today to repeat what his propaganda machine has been saying for months. “We want to negotiate. It’s the Ukrainians who don’t want to.” It is clear that these statements have no basis in reality. Firstly Putin announced a new wave of military mobilization This is supposed to happen after the vote in Russia scheduled for March. 

second And he continues to send men to the front, or rather “human material”, ill-equipped and untrained to die on the Avdiivka Front (losses are also estimated at between 600 and 1,000 men per week) to keep the Ukrainians busy on the Eastern Front so that they advance further down the front. The southeastern front, where they made some progress, passing through the eastern bank of the Dnipro River. 

third It continues to affect the infrastructure of the port of Odessa – The latest raid yesterday afternoon – to limit Ukraine’s ability to export wheat and other raw materials. 

the fourth Not a day goes by without Russian forces bombing Kherson (the last raid was a few hours ago and resulted in one person being killed). 

Fifth, Moscow suspended prisoner exchange talks in August It is slowly agreeing to allow only some kidnapped minors to return to Ukraine.

in the end Putin is well aware of how concerned Europeans are at the present time about the possibility of Washington reducing its commitment In supporting Ukraine economically and militarily, a burden that will inevitably fall on the shoulders of Kiev’s European allies. So That is why he talks about negotiations in order to wink at the part of public opinion that calls for a cessation of hostilities. But he certainly does not do this because he wants peace in Ukraine in good faith.

Here is the text of the excerpt from Putin’s speech dedicated to Ukraine at the G20: “In their words, the leaders said they were shocked by Russia’s continued aggression against Ukraine. Of course: military action is always a tragedy for individuals, families and nations. Naturally, we have to think about how to stop this tragedy. Among other things, Russia has never refused to hold a peace dialogue with Ukraine. It was not Russia, but Ukraine, that publicly announced that it was leaving the negotiating table; An order was also signed, a presidential decree, prohibiting negotiations.” Russia’s decision to launch an attack on Ukraine sparked the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II, and raised tensions between Moscow and the West to levels not seen since the Cold War. A Russian government official said on Tuesday that Moscow cannot “coexist” with the current government in Kiev, and that the ongoing special military operation will continue until Ukraine is “demilitarized.” Moscow, which militarily and illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, now controls nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory recognized by the international community. Putin claims that the region is now entirely Russian. In Japan, a man stabbed a woman and then shot two policemen: all three died

The war in Ukraine is a “tragedy” and we must think about how to “put an end to it.” 

This was stated by Russian President Vladimir Putin during his video speech at the G20 summit. Russia – according to the Russian president – has never rejected peace talks on Ukraine. Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. He has never called the ongoing invasion of Ukraine a “war,” but merely a “special military operation.” The Russian president, who described the conflict in Ukraine as a “shock,” also spoke about the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, which Israel launched after the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. For Putin, what is happening “in Palestine” is “the annihilation of the civilian population.”

1142054033,20231123,"The European Union will ban environmental destruction tantamount to “ecocide,” outlawing acts that destroy or cause substantial damage to ecosystems.

The rule, agreed to last week, is part of a sweeping overhaul of the 27-member bloc’s existing environmental laws, which also criminalizes nine new specific offenses including illegal logging, the introduction of invasive species and illegal water withdrawals.

Offenders can face at least ten years in prison while companies can be hit with fines amounting to a minimum of 5 percent of their total revenues or alternatively as much as €40 million (approximately $43 million) per offense.

Environmental crimes are lucrative for organized crime rings and are among the top four types of criminal activity worldwide, costing over $1 trillion per year, according to the World Bank. The crimes impair ecosystem services like carbon storage, harm human health and can irreversibly deplete natural resources. The illegal wildlife trade alone has driven species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants to the brink of extinction—every 30 minutes an elephant is poached for its ivory tusks.

The final text of the new rules, known in EU parlance as a “directive,” is not yet publicly available but will be released in the coming weeks once ambassadors of EU nations sign off on the draft rules.

The European Parliament and Council of the EU then must formally adopt the text, a step expected to happen early next year and which lawyers say is all but assured following the political agreement reached last Thursday. Once that happens, EU countries will have two years to enact national legislation in line with the directive, which acts as a baseline from which governments can set more stringent rules.

Criminalizing environmental offenses is not new. Most governments use a mix of administrative and criminal laws to staunch activities that harm nature. The new EU rules will supplant an existing 2008 environmental crimes directive which was largely ineffective because the nine crimes enumerated weren’t adequately enforced, sanctions were inadequate and cross border cooperation was lacking, a 2020 European Commision report found. The replacement directive includes measures for improved training and increased resources for judges, prosecutors and police.

What stands out about the new directive is the inclusion of the catchall “ecocide” provision that bans acts which destroy or cause “widespread and substantial damage” that is “irreversible or long-lasting” to protected areas or ecosystems of “considerable size” or value. The language of that provision doesn’t explicitly say “ecocide,” but lawmakers involved in negotiating the rules say they drew from the proposed definition of ecocide advanced by a panel of legal experts convened by the Stop Ecocide Foundation in 2021.

It is unclear whether offenses qualifying under the EU catchall provision must be committed intentionally or if reckless or negligent conduct will suffice. It is also unclear whether the emission of greenhouse gasses, and in what amounts, could land emitters on the wrong side of the law.

Marie Toussaint, a French member of the European Parliament involved in the EU negotiations, said the new rules could cover a range of acts not specifically enumerated like oil spills or the discharge of PFAS.

Critics of increased environmental regulation often argue that more stringent laws in one area, like the European Union, will increase costs for companies operating there, and over time will shift operations into jurisdictions that are less stringent, creating pollution hot spots. Supporters of pollution bans contend the rules spur innovation that ultimately benefits industry and society more broadly.

European countries’ forthcoming criminal investigation and prosecution of a wide range of behaviors through the ecocide provision will likely spur companies and individuals carrying out ecologically risky activities, like mining and other resource extraction, to increase precautions to prevent harm to nature.

The new rules, which cover individuals and businesses that incite, aid or abet environmental crimes, are also likely to have an impact on insurance of, and investments into, those activities.

“One of the big effects of this directive is that it shows the power of criminal law and how it can upgrade how we operate on the planet,” said Jonas Roupé, an international consultant, board professional and co-founder of End Ecocide Sweden. “You need laws in place that make it matter for individuals in power.”

Environmentalists have long advocated for enshrining “ecocide” into the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, making it the court’s fifth crime alongside illegal war, crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Advocates argue that beyond the legal effects, such a move would influence public perception of what is and is not ethical behavior.

Monica Schüldt, co-founder of Ecocide Law Alliance, compared the new EU directive to laws criminalizing the corporal punishment of children. In 1979, Sweden was the first country in the world to do so, resulting in a significant drop in the amount of domestic violence against children.

“That was a controversial law when it was introduced because people had the mindset of ‘how can we raise responsible adults if we can’t use force,’” Schüldt said. “No one would dream of it being acceptable these days and that is what we’re looking at with our relationship with nature today. This is the kind of change in values and behavior that ecocide can catalyze.”

The origins of the idea of an ecocide crime date back to the United States’ use of Agent Orange during the Vietnam war. Other examples of ecocide commonly discussed are deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest, Russia’s destruction of the Kakhova dam this year in Ukraine and the Deep Water Horizon oil spill. In 2017, the late Scottish lawyer Polly Higgens and Jojo Mehta co-founded Stop Ecocide International, beginning a worldwide campaign to enshrine ecocide in international law.

“The next step is very obvious,” Schüldt said. “It’s time that we outlaw ecocide globally.”"
1142056513,20231123,"In an unexpected result, the party of far-right politician Geert Wilders has won the most seats in Dutch parliamentary elections.

Anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders said Thursday that he is ready to join the next Dutch coalition government after he surged to a huge election victory that marked a stunning lurch to the far right for a nation long known as a beacon of tolerance.

The result is sending shock waves through Europe, where far-right ideology is on the rise , and puts Wilders in line to lead talks to form the next governing coalition and possibly become the first far-right prime minister of the Netherlands.

“It is going to happen that the PVV is in the next Cabinet,” Wilders said, using the Dutch abbreviation for his Party for Freedom.

With nearly all votes counted, the party was forecast to win 37 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament, two more than predicted by an exit poll when voting finished Wednesday night and more than double the 17 it won at the last election.

Wilders got a standing ovation when he met his party’s lawmakers at the parliament building Thursday morning.

“Can you imagine it? Thirty-seven seats!” he said to cheers.

Other political parties were holding separate meetings Thursday to discuss the election’s outcome before the expected arduous process of forming a new governing coalition begins Friday.

Wilders’ election campaign included calls for a referendum on the Netherlands leaving the European Union, a total halt to accepting asylum seekers and migrant restrictions at Dutch borders.

It also advocates the . He says he wants no mosques or Islamic schools in the country, although he has been milder about Islam during this election campaign than in the past.

One of the most prominent Muslim organizations in the Netherlands said it had received emails expressing support since the election result.

“That’s reassuring,” the Contact Group Muslims and Government said in a statement. “In addition, Mr. Wilders has said that he will become prime minister of all Dutch people, regardless of their religion, sex or color. The Netherlands is a state governed by the rule of law and we trust that it is a tolerant country.”

In a statement on its website, the Dutch branch of Amnesty International said: “Yesterday human rights lost. A racist party won the Dutch elections.”

Although known for his harsh rhetoric , Wilders began courting other right-wing and centrist parties by saying in a victory speech that whatever policies he pushes will be “within the law and constitution.”

His victory appeared based on his campaign to curtail migration — the issue that caused the last governing coalition to — and to tackle issues such as the cost-of-living crisis and housing shortages.

“I think, to be honest, very many people are very focused on one particular problem,” voter Norbert van Beelen said in The Hague on Thursday morning. “It’s all about immigration.”

In his victory speech, Wilders said he wants to end what he called the “asylum tsunami,” referring to the migration issue.

“The Dutch will be No. 1 again,” Wilders said. “The people must get their nation back.”

Wilders, long an antagonist who lashed out at Islam, the EU and migrants, was in the past labeled a Dutch version of Donald Trump. His positions , but never fully to it.

But to become prime minister of a country known for compromise politics, he must persuade other party leaders to work with him in a coalition government. That will be tough, as mainstream parties are reluctant to join forces with him and his party. But the size of his victory strengthens his hand in any negotiations.

Wilders called on other parties to constructively engage in coalition talks. Pieter Omtzigt, a former centrist Christian Democrat who built his own New Social Contract party in three months to take 20 seats, said he would always be open to talks.

Kate Parker of the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a written analysis of the election that Wilders’ party “will have to moderate its far-right policy stance” if it is to attract support from Omtzigt’s party and the center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, also known as VVD, of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

The party that finished after Wilders’ in the election results was an alliance of the center-left Labor party and Green Left, which was forecast to win 25 seats. But its leader, Frans Timmermans, made clear that Wilders should not count on a coalition with him.

The historic victory came one year after the win of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose Brothers of Italy party’s roots were steeped in nostalgia for fascist dictator Benito Mussolini . Meloni has since mellowed her stance on several issues and has become the acceptable face of the hard right in the EU.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who boasts of turning Hungary into an “illiberal” state and has similarly harsh stances on migration and EU institutions, was quick to congratulate Wilders. “The winds of change are here! Congratulations,” Orban said.

During the final weeks of his campaign, Wilders somewhat softened his stance and vowed that he would be a prime minister for all Dutch people, so much so that he gained the moniker Geert “Milders.”

The election was called after Rutte’s fourth and final coalition government resigned in July after failing to agree to measures to rein in migration. He has been in office for 13 years, making him the Netherlands’ longest-serving leader, and plansto step down once a newcoalition government is formed.

Rutte was replaced by Dilan Yesilgoz-Zegerius, a former refugee from Turkey who could have become the country’s first female prime minister had her party won the most votes.

Instead, it was forecast to lose 10 seats to end up with 24.

The result is the latest in a series of elections altering the European political landscape.

In Slovakia, Spain and Germany, among other countries, populist and hard-right parties have made gains."

The investigation aims to verify the adoption of appropriate security measures on public and private websites to prevent “web scraping” of personal data used for AI training via third parties from “the ‘spiders’ of the manufacturers of artificial intelligence algorithms.”

According to the regulator, this “fact-finding survey” applies to all public and private subjects operating as data controllers, established in Italy, or offering services in Italy that provide freely accessible personal data online.

Although it did not name specific companies, it said that it is “in fact” known that “various AI platforms” scrape the web for the purpose of collecting large quantities of personal data. It said that after the investigation, it would take any necessary measures “even urgently.”

In July, Google was hit with a class-action lawsuit in the United States over its new AI data-scraping privacy policy across its web services for its own AI algorithmic training purposes.

Italian regulators invited AI industry experts, academics and others to participate in the process and share views or comments within 60 days.

The Italian privacy watchdog was one of the first to scrutinize AI after it banned the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT from operating in Italy due to privacy breaches in March 2023. In May, Italy set aside millions of euros in a designated fund for workers at risk of AI replacement.

Earlier this week, Italy, France and Germany entered into an agreement on future AI regulation, according to a joint paper seen by Reuters. The agreement is expected to help further similar negotiations at the European Union level.

The three countries backed the idea of creating voluntary commitments for large and small AI providers in the European Union.

1142063655,20231123,"France, which is already losing its influence in Africa and countries affected by former colonialism, has decided to choose a new outpost. The EU mission and France's new weapons that Armenia wants to bring to the region indicate that the South Caucasus has already been chosen as the next target.

Obviously, France has been pursuing a policy of colonisation since the 16th century. If we take a glance at the history of France, we can see that the country has ruled and is still ruling African countries, including Algeria, Morocco, Chad, Senegal, Tunisia, Benin, Gobon, Vietnam, and Cameroon as colonies. Currently, 13 states are strongly affected, and France keeps meddling in their domestic and foreign policies. The colonisation policy of France is usually observed through coups that, in the last year, shook countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Niger and brought some strong economic crises.

Although France has been among the developed countries since 1998, if we look at the countries that have been colonised under the guise of democracy, it is crystal clear that these countries are in a deplorable state and are experiencing a serious economic crisis.

The colonisation policy put forward by France in the past centuries (epochs) is also reflected in the new era. It is just that we can see the manifestation that France is not open but is pursuing this policy underhandedly in more sophisticated ways. For example, in order to conduct the policy of colonisation in African countries and interfere with their domestic and foreign policies, France is controlling the currency of the colonised states and making it dependent on itself.

If we look at world statistics, France ranks 4th in the world in terms of gold deposits. It raises and balances its economy by absorbing the gold reserves of Guiana, which it manages as a colony.

Over the past five-six months, four African countries, having been exhausted by the insidious policies of France, have insisted on the withdrawal of the French army. Thus, France's pseudo-authority in African countries has already weakened, and France has leaned towards the South Caucasus to fuel the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia and to continue its nefarious policy.

Note that Azerbaijan regained its sovereignty after the 44-day war and liberated more than 20 percent of its land after 30 years of occupation. In the post-war period, Azerbaijan proposed to Armenia to sign a peace agreement in order to end the war in the South Caucasus and bring peace. An interstate 3-way meeting with the conflicting parties was held with the participation of the European Union, and preliminary steps were taken to sign a peace agreement. However, France's desire to take part in the 4-Way meeting in Europe slowed down the peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which even in the post-war period continued to supply and sell a large amount of ammunition to Armenia.

Today, Azerbaijan is taking important steps to protect the South Caucasus region from the threat of France as well as from the influence of other Western forces. Although France is a powerful country, it does not want relations with Azerbaijan to be completely spoiled.

Anar Hasanov, a political analyst commenting on the issue for Azernews, is of the same opinion. He states that as much as France takes a step against Azerbaijan, the opposite side will receive a reciprocal response. However, according to the analyst, this cannot affect the complete suspension of relations between France and Azerbaijan.

""Despite the fact that France shows antagonism, Russia has French embassies, and France has a Russian Embassy. Relations in the humanitarian sphere remain and continue. Therefore, relations between France and Azerbaijan will be tense and cold. I do not think that any action, such as higher economic sanctions, could be imposed,"" he said.

In addition, Anar Hasanov clarified France's intention to arm Armenia and noted that although this is a common threat to the South Caucasus, it cannot lead to the start of a new war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

""I do not consider the possibility of a new war between Azerbaijan and Armenia at the instigation of France, as the military-technical potential of Armenia was destroyed during the 44-day war, and I do not think that Armenia is in such a situation other than some kind of offensive operation. Armenia did not have the resources for the war until 2020, and especially for the war with Azerbaijan after 2020.

It seems to me that the support of France is most likely directed towards the domestic political agenda, in the sense that the goal is to separate Armenia from Russia. We know that Russia's support in terms of weapons is delayed, but the French, taking advantage of this, provide Armenia with some modern weapons. That is, one gets the impression that an ally refuses (delays) military assistance, and the latter takes the chance to go ahead. I think that around 20–40 bastions, some kind of missile, and Indian support cannot be a point of recurrence of war. Obviously, this weapon is needed for defence. I would even say that it is not a sufficient resource to develop an offensive operation, and I do not think that this resource will be sufficient in the next decade. Most likely, this is dust in the eyes and a demonstration of iron muscles—nothing more than an attempt to separate Armenia from Russia—but I do not see this as a serious threat to Azerbaijan."
1142071567,20231123,"Pesticides have not only become a prominent concern globally but in Kenya.

Proponents argue they are vital in pest and disease control in food systems, while the antagonists raise the alarm about the potential toxicity to human health and the environment.

The point of contention is the toxic nature of certain pesticides sold in Kenya but have been banned in countries of origin. According to a 2023 Route to Food Report, 76 percent of the total volume of pesticides used in Kenya are categorised as highly hazardous, and 44 percent of these pesticides are banned in the European Union.

This means that Kenyan farmers and consumers are exposed to pesticide products that can disrupt the human hormonal systems, nervous systems, induce genetic mutations and cancer, and pose threats to the reproductive systems and the unborn. Moreover, from an environmental perspective, these pesticides are extremely harmful to fish and bees.

What is extremely concerning is that these killer pesticides are extensively used by farmers in Kenya. In 2020, Kenyan farmers spent $72.7 million on pesticide products.

The global pesticide industry is a multi-billion industry. The Pesticides Global Market Report 2022 shows that the global pesticides market is expected to grow to $105.39 billion in 2026 from $78.16 billion in 2021.

Despite the acceptance of these pesticides among farmers, their use comes at a cost: they contaminate our food and soil, pollute our water and air, and harm our biodiversity. In 2016, research found that 35 out of 716 individuals aged between 15 and 40 years treated at Kericho Referral Hospital in March and April, suffered from pesticide poisoning. In 2021, bee colonies in Kenya declined by 16.76 percent and pesticide use was identified as one of the factors contributing to this decline.

The concern, therefore, about toxic pesticides in Kenya and across the African continent is fundamentally about safeguarding our health and protecting our environment. It is sad that the pesticide proponents disregard the plea by scientists to phase them out of the Kenyan market as misinformation.

1142071569,20231123,
1142074149,20231123,"TBILISI -- It was 20 years ago that Georgia's Rose Revolution applied a radical jolt to the country's politics, economy, and foreign policy. For many in Georgia and abroad, the revolution and the man it brought to the presidency, Mikheil Saakashvili, represented a new hope for the poor, isolated country.

But when the anniversary is marked on November 23 -- the day Eduard Shevardnadze, the country's president and Soviet-era leader, resigned -- many in Georgia won't be celebrating. Especially the current leadership.

 

 ""The Rose Revolution brought to this country torture, corruption, the loss of 20 percent of our territories,"" said Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of the ruling Georgian Dream party, last week. ""To celebrate the 20th anniversary is simply shameless.""

 

 The degree of vitriol between Georgia's current and former ruling parties is hard to overstate. Georgian Dream, which took power in 2012 after defeating Saakashvili and his United National Movement (ENM), to this day defines itself primarily in opposition to the former regime. Saakashvili, now in jail on a variety of charges from his time in office, calls his successors Russian puppets and says the charges against him are politically motivated.

Polarization in Georgian politics is so deep that the European Union emphasized it as one of the key issues in the country's bid to become a candidate to join the bloc.

 

 That bitter animosity, however, obscures just how much the Georgian Dream government is continuing along the path that the Rose Revolution began to blaze 20 years ago. From foreign policy to resolving its separatist conflicts to the economy, the government today is in significant ways fulfilling the legacy set by its hated enemies.

The divide in Georgian politics ""is not really polarization in classical terms like in Western countries, where it is based on ideologies,"" said Kornely Kakachia, the head of the Tbilisi think tank Georgian Institute for Politics. ""In Georgia, what we have is more like personality-driven polarization.... They are just cursing each other, talking about how bad their opponent is, but never talking about issues.""

 

 A 2021 study by a group of political scientists for the German Friedrich Ebert Foundation found that the policies of the two main feuding blocs -- Georgian Dream and Saakashvili's ENM -- had more commonalities than differences, especially in terms of economic policy.

 

 Under Shevardnadze's rule, the economy was stagnating and there were widespread allegations of state corruption. Suspicions of vote-rigging in November 2003 parliamentary elections led to thousands of Georgians taking to the streets, culminating on November 22, 2003, with Saakashvili supporters storming parliament, prompting the embattled president to flee.

 

 Elected by a landslide in new elections six weeks later, Saakashvili and his government had a strong ideological vision: a staunchly pro-Western foreign policy and a radically free-market economic policy.

Under his rule, the country became a close ally of the United States and its enmity with Russia deepened to the point that the two fought a war in 2008 over the breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The economy opened up to such a degree that, in the last year of Saakashvili's rule, the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings placed Georgia ninth in the world.

But Saakashvili and the ENM were voted out in 2012 by Georgian Dream, a diverse coalition assembled by billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili that had little in common besides a desire to remove a regime that was seen as being increasingly authoritarian. Saakashvili's party was accused of persistent abuses of power, exemplified by a prison-torture scandal that broke shortly before the elections.

 

 What came after Saakashvili, though, did not amount to a drastic change or a new political direction. ""Ivanishvili is not a very political person. He doesn't have a vision or any ideology or program,"" Kakachia said. ""This affected the whole Georgian Dream; they were more opportunistic than ENM, which had its own political vision.""

 

 Once in office, Georgian Dream did bring in a few policy innovations. Most notably, the new leadership has taken a less confrontational approach toward Russia, even as it continued moving closer to the West at the same time.

In the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Georgian Dream has doubled down on its policy of accommodating Moscow. Just how Georgia should deal with Russia has become the sharpest point of contention in the country's politics.

 

 Lately, Georgian Dream has taken a sharp turn toward social conservatism, embracing rhetoric of ""family values"" and identity, inspired by the example of Viktor Orban's Hungary. (While Saakashvili and his government were not outspoken liberals, cultural issues played little role in the way they governed.)

But to many Georgians, the similarities between the two regimes still outweigh the differences.

Take the loss of 20 percent of the country's territory that Georgian Dream Chairman Kobakhidze mentioned. It refers to the war over South Ossetia in 2008, which resulted in a Russian invasion of Georgia and Moscow's subsequent recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent republics. Both now host thousands of Russian troops.

While the territories broke away in the early 1990s, well before Saakashvili came to power, the 2008 war cemented the loss. It is one of Georgian Dream's favorite talking points.

 

 But Georgian Dream for the most part follows the agenda set by Saakashvili's government, argues Paata Zakareshvili, who served as state minister for reconciliation and civic equality in the early days of Georgian Dream rule and is now a sharp critic of both regimes.

 

 While the previous government under Shevardnadze had held regular dialogues with representatives of the de facto governments in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Saakashvili halted those talks. ""There is no point in talking to Abkhazians and Ossetians. They are nobody. Russia and Moscow decide everything,"" Zakareshvili said, paraphrasing the previous government's approach. ""That was [Saakashvili's] concept.""

When Georgian Dream came to power, little changed. ""They took the same approach, they just modernized it,"" Zakareshvili told RFE/RL. The government continues to refuse to talk to the de facto entities, for the most part out of inertia and fear that doing otherwise would expose it to criticism, he says.

 

 ""They are afraid to touch this topic,"" Zakareshvili said. ""As soon as Georgian Dream would start talking to [Abkhazians and South Ossetians], the nationalists would say, 'You see, they are carrying out a Russian policy....' They don't have a policy, they only have inaction.""

 

 In relation to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgian Dream accepts the premise that Russia is the only party worth dealing with; its innovation is trying to accommodate and placate Moscow rather than confronting it directly, as did the ENM leadership. But both suffer from the same fatal flaw, Zakareshvili notes.

""Russia is a problem. They are 80 percent of the problem, but the other 20 percent is our problem with the Abkhazians and Ossetians. As long as we don't solve this problem, Russia is going to take advantage of it,"" he said.

Despite Kobakhidze's protestations about the human rights record of the Saakashvili government, many argue that the two regimes are following similar trajectories: an initial opening up and liberalization, followed by gradually increasing authoritarianism.

""With every successive regime, we have returned again and again to a single-party system that controls more and more institutions,"" President Salome Zurabishvili said in a recent interview. The president was elected to the largely symbolic post in 2018 with the backing of Georgian Dream, but has since become an outspoken critic of the ruling party.

Georgian Dream recently tried to impeach the president over trips she made to the European Union without the consent of the government, but the motion failed to gain enough votes in parliament.

 

 The petty corruption that Saakashvili famously stamped out with a full-scale overhaul of the law enforcement system has been almost wiped out in Georgia, while the high-level variety -- politically connected businessmen getting favorable treatment -- remains present.

 

 But it is in the economic sphere where the continuity between the two parties' time in power is most pronounced. The radical economic changes that the Rose Revolution wrought -- a strong adherence to the free market and deregulation -- if anything have only deepened.

Under Saakashvili, Georgia placed a heavy priority on attracting foreign investment, believing it was the key to attracting the capital required for the country to grow. So, it reduced and simplified taxes and slashed regulations. To woo foreign investors, they touted the fact that the country has no minimum wage. ""Establishing a laissez-faire state after the Rose Revolution became one of the central discourses of nation-building,"" political economist Ia Eradze wrote.



 That strategy did attract investors and boost GDP growth, but the benefits did not accrue to ordinary Georgians, Eradze says. And when Georgian Dream came to power and started publishing economic development strategies, they initially criticized the previous government's approach. ""And I thought, 'OK, this looks kind of promising, let's see what happens,'"" Eradze told RFE/RL. ""But then there was really no substantial change.""

 

 Toward the end of the Saakashvili era, the government passed the Economic Liberty Act, which enshrined principles of austerity in the constitution. The law made it impossible to significantly raise taxes without a referendum, for example. The law, Saakashvili promised when introducing it, represented ""an ambition to turn Georgia into a real flagship of the world liberal economic ideology.""

 

 Critics say the law hamstrings the government's ability to manage the economy and, in 2017, there was an effort to revoke it. But, in the end, the government kept it on the books for 12 more years.

""We are still dependent on the agenda that Saakashvili set,"" said Beka Natsvlishvili, a lecturer of political economy and a former member of parliament in a social-democratic faction of Georgian Dream. (Natsvlishvili pushed for the revocation of the Economic Liberty Act and broke with the party in 2019 over its economic policies.)

""Nobody [in the current government] talks about economic policy, because it is the conventional wisdom that the market would regulate everything, we have this kind of path dependency,"" he told RFE/RL.

 

 In some ways, Georgian Dream even goes further than its predecessors. This year, the government rolled out a new pension scheme in which individuals themselves have to choose how to invest their retirement savings.

""In the case of pensions, they even deepened the neoliberalism,"" Natsvlishvili said.

 

 In 2020, the last year the World Bank did its Ease of Doing Business rankings, Georgia had continued to climb, reaching seventh in the world. For a party largely uninterested in economic issues, staying devoted to the free market is the path of least resistance, Eradze says.

 

 ""This existing kind of view of development, that as a state you just create all favorable conditions for [foreign direct investment] to come in and then everything just happens on its own -- it's an easy way to think of development,"" she said. ""It can also bring fast revenues. So, you have this kind of immediate result and then, as a prime minister, you can get on TV and tell the population, 'Look, our economy grew' and who cares how.""

 

 A more hands-on economic policy, by contrast, takes a lot of work. Eradze says a more actively engaged government would have to work out a policy sector-by-sector, coordinate the actions with the central bank, and implement corresponding education reforms.

""This all has to go hand in hand, and you might see the results after 10 years. I have a feeling nobody wants to put that much effort into it,"" she said.

 

 Eradze notes that opinion polls consistently show Georgians' top concerns are economic. A new survey, released in mid-November by the International Republican Institute, asked, ""What is the most important problem facing our country today?"" The top four answers -- representing 67 percent of the responses -- were all economic.

 

 ""If you look at our politics and the parties, neither the ruling party nor the opposition really brings up this topic,"" she said. ""It's a huge, huge gap. I don't know how long that can go on."""
1142076528,20231123,"The RA NA President Alen Simonyan received the EU resident and non-resident Ambassadors accredited in Armenia on November 23. In his opening speech at the meeting, the RA NA President noted that the European Union continues to be a primary partner supporting the reform agenda being implemented by Armenia.

He stressed that the legal contract field had been expanded, and our cooperation had been supplemented with new directions, in particular, the dialogue on political and security issues between Armenia and the EU.

“Dear diplomats, I, as a parliamentarian, would like to convey to you the European aspirations of the majority of my voters. The convergence between Armenia and Europe should be continuous and fundamental,” the NA President underlined.

At the meeting, reference was made to the early start of the dialogue between Armenia and the European Union on the liberalization of visas, Armenia-EU inter-parliamentary cooperation, particularly within the framework of the Parliamentary Partnership Committee (PPC).

The RA NA President expressed his regret that Azerbaijan refuses to take part in the meetings initiated by the EU, not adhering to the agreements reached in Brussels and making its bellicose and conquering ambitions obvious.

Thanking the EU member states for sending observers, Alen Simonyan highly valued the decision to deploy the EU mission, which is a significant step towards establishing stability in our region.

The idea of the Crossroads of Peace project was introduced to the EU Ambassadors, which provides economic and communication development opportunities for both the South Caucasus region and the countries outside of it.

Answering the questions regarding the forcibly displaced Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, the RA NA President mentioned that the Armenian Government these days is focused on assessing the needs of the people forcibly displaced from Nagorno-Karabakh and solving their primary problems, which can be more effective only with strong international involvement. He added that our country greatly appreciates the humanitarian aid already allocated by the European Union and the member states.

During the discussion, they also touched upon the decision of the International Court of Justice on November 17, by which the Court obliged Baku to ensure the safe return of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians to their homes, the safety of those who stayed there and those who want to leave.

The representatives of the diplomatic corps also inquired about the parliamentary opposition, the involvement of women in the Parliament, the influence of women on decisions."
1142076533,20231123,"Operation Atalanta, the European Union (EU) maritime tasking in the Indian Ocean off the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea, today (Thursday, 23 November) welcomes a new operation commander and marks an early commemoration of its upcoming 15th anniversary.

Spanish Vice Admiral Ignacio Villanueva Serrano takes the mantle of command from Vice Admiral José María Núñez Torrente, a fellow Spanish flag officer, during a parade at Naval Station (NS) Rota in Cadiz. Billed as the Gateway to the Mediterranean, the NS is part of a larger naval base with port and airfield facilities and support services for the Spanish Air Force and Navy as well as NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) and US (United States) forces.

Serrano is a US (United States) Navy qualified naval aviator and at sea has commanded Spanish Navy gun patrol vessels and landing ship platforms as well as holding land-based senior positions.

The change of command parade will also mark the 15th anniversary of Atalanta, ahead of its official launch date of 8 December following EU approval to create the operation a month earlier. Royal Navy (RN) Rear Admiral Philip Jones was the first Atalanta commander with Commodore Antonios Papaioannou of the Hellenic Navy the first force commander.

Atalanta’s mandate has been added to in response to changes in the maritime situation in its area of operation (AOO) and it is currently rated a maritime security provider in the north-western Indian Ocean. The AOO includes Gulf of Aden and neighbouring countries, including the port and city of Muscat in Oman; the Somali Basin; the Red Sea; and the gulfs of Aqaba and Suez.

Executive tasks include protecting World Food Programme (WFP) and other vulnerable shipping; deterring, preventing and repressing piracy and armed robbery as well as contributing to “disruption” of drug and weapons trafficking."

The UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs welcomed the participation of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the Sudan Humanitarian Forum as a sign of a shared recognition of the severity of the humanitarian crisis in Sudan. He called for an unhindered access to reach all people in need, and particularly to contain the ongoing cholera outbreak. Separately, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said in an update that at least 2,525 suspected cases of acute watery diarrhoea/cholera have been reported in Sudan, including 78 associated deaths, in 27 localities across seven states.

The government of Sudan said they are “terminating UNITAMS with immediate effect” in a letter addressed to the UN Secretary-General. The government, nonetheless, said it remained committed to constructive engagements with the UN. In a related development, the Secretary-General appointed Ramtane Lamamra of Algeria as his Personal Envoy for Sudan.

The UN human rights office, OHCHR, voiced alarm over reports of another ethnically motivated mass attack in the Darfur region of Sudan. In a statement on 17 November, OHCHR called on the RSF and all other parties to the conflict to respect their international humanitarian law obligations to ensure protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure. The violence and human rights abuses in Sudan have been condemned by the European Union and the Troika (Norway, UK, and USA).

UNHCR extended the Level 2 emergency status for Central African Republic (CAR) and Ethiopia (Sudan Situation) by an additional three months, following the expiration of the initial Level 2 emergency declaration on May 17. Sudan, Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan, initially included in the Level 2 emergency declaration for six months, were subsequently elevated to Level 3 emergencies."
1142085516,20231123,"Chisinau, 23 November /MOLDPRES/ - The programme, Used-up Household Appliances, was launched in Chisinau today. Within the programme, citizens will be able to benefit from vouchers for replacing obsolete and used-up household appliances by new ones, with high energy efficiency.

At the first stage of the project, 2,200 vouchers worth 12,000 lei each will be provided. The money will be able to be used to buy big household appliances, such as fridges, washing machines or electric ovens. To benefit from the new technology, citizens will have to make a their own contribution of 20 per cent of the asset’s value and provide, in exchange, old household appliances of the same category, which are to be recycled. At the same time, about 50,000 families from Moldova will receive vouchers worth 500 lei to purchase LED lamps.

Director of the Agency for Energy Efficiency (AEE) Ion Muntean said the beneficiaries would be selected depending on more criteria, including the energy vulnerability degree, consumption of energy, number of family members. ‘’There are two types of vouchers for the current session: of 500 lei for buying led lamps and worth 12,000 lei for big household appliances. The people having a voucher of 500 lei just have to present their identity cards at partner shops and buy the led lamps. The holders of the vouchers worth 12,000 lei will have to pay a contribution of 20 per cent of the asset’s value. The session launched today will have 2,200 beneficiaries of big equipment and will be open till 3 December. Subsequently, a new session will be launched, with at least 4,000 beneficiaries scheduled to be included in the list,’’ Muntean noted.

Energy Minister Victor Parlicov said the project launched tackled two problems: on the one hand, - support for people in maximal vulnerability and on the other hand – the problem of energy efficiency, i.e. the reduction, on the long-term, of the impact on the invoices through cutting of the consumption of energy due to the use of more efficient household appliances. ‘’We can reduce the vulnerability of households not only through the fact that we provide them with compensations, but also through the fact that we reduce the invoices and the consumption of energy on a long term,’’ Victor Parlicov added.

The programme has a budget of 5.8 million euros and was developed with the European Union’s financial support and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Moldova, in partnership with AEE.

Ambassador of the European Union to Moldova Jānis Mažeiks said that, starting from today, families from Moldova would benefit from a programme meant to contribute to their well-being. ‘’Now, when Moldova advances with quick steps to its goal of accession to EU, we hope that the country’s citizens will be part of the programme on energy efficiency and reducing the emissions of greenhouse gas, contributing, at the same time, to the decreasing of the environmental pollution. EU supports also Moldova’s efforts in renewable energy reform,’’ the ambassador noted.

UNDP Resident Representative in Moldova Daniela Gasparikova said the programme launched had ambitious goals and the authorities would be able to use the experience gained, in order to improve the system in the long run.

The programme’s beneficiaries from this year are selected from among people who registered for compensations for energy in 2022. The people who register for compensations this year will be potential beneficiaries of the programme in 2024.

The beneficiaries are distributed moderately according to areas, depending on the number of residents in each district. Those who fail to turn to good account the vouchers received in due time, will be eligible in the next sessions of the programme, depending on the financial resources available."
1142083378,20231123,"Europe’s far-right politicians are lining up to congratulate the anti-Islam, Euroskeptic radical Geert Wilders on his shock victory in Wednesday’s Dutch parliamentary elections.

Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Rally, said she was “delighted” by Wilders’ triumph. “Geert Wilders and his movement are allies of the National Rally,” Le Pen told French public radio broadcaster France Inter Thursday morning.

“They demonstrate that more and more countries within the European Union are contesting the way it works,” Le Pen said.

Wilders’ far-right Freedom Party (PVV) made an unexpected breakthrough, securing 37 of the 150 parliamentary seats, according to the latest polls on Thursday morning — making PVV the biggest party in the country.

The election results sent shudders through Brussels, as Wilders has openly called for a “Nexit” referendum on leaving the EU.

Asked whether a potential “Nexit” referendum would be good news, Le Pen answered: “The good news is when people can express themselves.”

“It’s up to the Dutch people to choose their destiny, just as the British people have done,” the National Rally leader added.

Wilders, who has been dubbed the “Dutch Donald Trump” for his anti-immigration agenda and shock of blond hair, collected praise from other fellow Euroskeptic leaders across the Continent.

“A new Europe is possible,” Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-immigration League party, wrote on X on Wednesday evening, calling Wilders a “friend” and an “ally of the League.”

“Congratulations on this great success,” Alice Weidel, leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party said on Thursday morning. “All of Europe wants a political turnaround!” she added.

Wilders also received congratulations from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, with whom he shares an opposition to the EU’s support for Ukraine. “The winds of change are here!” Orbán wrote on X, in reference to a song from the West German rock band Scorpions, which was released shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

“Bravo, Geert!!!!!,” Harald Vilimsky, a European lawmaker with the Austrian far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), wrote in a post showing a picture of leaders from the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) group in the European Parliament. “Proud of my political friends and our alliance,” Vilimsky said.

Belgium’s Tom Van Grieken, the leader of the far-right Vlaams Belang party, said the results signaled that people were “yearning for real change.”

“Parties like ours are coming all over Europe!” Van Grieken said.

“More and more Europeans are demanding in the streets and at the ballot box that their nations, their borders and their rights be defended,” Santiago Abascal, the leader of of Spain’s far-right Vox party, said."
1142083379,20231123,"India was among the 125 countries to vote in the United Nations General Assembly for the organisation to develop a global tax framework. The historic resolution was tabled by the Africa Group and a host of Western countries or OECD nations, including UK, US, and the entire European Union bloc, voted against it.

The resolution was tabled by the African Group under the title: “Promotion of inclusive and effective international tax cooperation at the United Nations”.

“It marked a historic moment for Africa and the world,” the African Union said in a release.

The resolution was passed with 125 vote in favor of the Tax Convention, with 48 votes against, and 9 Abstentions.

The OECD — a group of 38 mostly high-income countries that includes the US and the UK — for decades has dominated international tax policy. However, recent years have seen growing criticism over the outsized power wielded by wealthy countries in its closed-door decision-making, including at the top levels of the UN.

The budget for the new intergovernmental tax process will be up for approval at the UN in December 2023. The negotiations between governments are expected to begin in 2024.

Meanwhile, the countries that have voted against the resolution will still be invited to join the intergovernmental UN process to develop a new global Tax Convention which begins in 2024.

The focus, until August 2024, will be on developing Terms of Reference for a new UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation. Based on these Terms of Reference, governments then will proceed to negotiate the new UN Tax Convention.

As per the African Union, the resolution represents a beacon of hope for developing nations.

“It will facilitate the access of much needed financial resources, crucial for responding to the current debt crises and facilitate the pursuit of achieving sustainable development. It is also in line with African aspirations as outlined in the AU Agenda 2063, reinforcing the commitment by Member States, to strengthening tax systems and fostering tax equity,” the African Union said.

The resolution is also seen as a step in line with Africa’s call for the necessity for restructuring the global financial system to ensure increased funding for attaining the sustainable development goals."
1142083387,20231123,"The ETC Securities are designed to provide investors with exposure to a metal without having to take physical delivery of the metal. The underlying ""Metal"" for the ETC Securities is: gold. Each ETC Security relates to a specific amount in weight of Metal, specified in the Final Terms, known as the ""Metal Entitlement per ETC Security"". On any particular day, the ETC Security can be viewed as giving an exposure to that ------amount of Metal as the amount payable in respect of each ETC Security and the value per ETC Security (the ""Value per ETC Security"") is linked to the value of the Metal. In order to back its obligations under the ETC Securities, the Issuer will seek to hold enough Metal to meet its obligations under the ETC Securities. The precise amount it holds at any time may be more or less than the aggregate amount of the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security to reflect the periodic payment of product fees. The proceeds from the disposal of the underlying Metal, plus any interest received on the proceeds of such disposal less any negative interest, net of any deductions, will equal the amount due under the ETC Securities (subject to certain minimum amounts owed). The Metal will be held for the Issuer by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor or replacement) (the ""Secured Account Custodian"") and will be generally held on an ""allocated"" basis. This means that specifically identifiable physical items of the Metal are allocated to the Issuer and are segregated from metal held for other clients of the custodian. However, for operational purposes, small amounts of Metal may be held on an ""unallocated"" basis. This means that the Secured Account Custodian maintains an account in the name of the Issuer which shows them as being entitled to delivery of a particular amount of the Metal but without specific physical metal having been identified. Where Metal is held on an ""unallocated"" basis the right to delivery is a purely contractual right and, as such, the Issuer is an unsecured creditor of the custodian and is exposed to the credit risk of the custodian. The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and any underlying Metal. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as ""Secured Property"" for this Series. Securityholders will not, by reason of holding such Series, have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities. The security will become enforceable if payment of the redemption amount in respect of such ETC Securities is not made when due on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the Scheduled Early Redemption Date (defined below) (if applicable). On the Scheduled Maturity Date, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Final Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Final Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount (defined below) and (ii) 10 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security as at the series issue date (the ""Minimum Debt Principal Amount"") plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Final Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Final Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the volume-weighted average prices per metal unit at which the Metal Agent (defined below) is able to sell the underlying Metal (""Average Metal Sale Price"") during the Final Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Final Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Final Redemption Valuation Date. ""Final Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date specified in the Final Terms or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. ""Specified Interest Amount"" is the amount of interest per ETC Security equal to that ETC Security's pro rata share of the amount of interest which has accrued (if any) on the proceeds of realisation of the underlying Metal deposited into the Series Cash Account (defined below) during or relating to the relevant redemption disposal period. Whilst interest may accrue at a positive, zero or negative rate on the Series Cash Account, the Specified Interest Amount is subject to a minimum of zero and any negative interest shall instead be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the underlying Metal. If any of the early redemption events occur, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Early Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Early Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount and (ii) the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Early Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Early Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the Average Metal Sale Price during the Early Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Early Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Early Redemption Valuation Date. The ""Scheduled Early Redemption Date"" is the 8th business day following the Early Redemption Disposal Period. The ""Early Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date of the occurrence of an early redemption event or the date on which the Trustee gives notice that, due to the occurrence of an event of default, the ETC Securities shall become due and payable at their Early Redemption Amount on the Scheduled Early Redemption Date, or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. There can be no assurance that the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, will be greater than or equal to the amount invested by any securityholder. If the Final Metal Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, plus the Specified Interest Amount falls below the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount, then due to the limited recourse nature of the ETC Securities, securityholders are unlikely to receive payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, in full and may receive zero. The Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount per ETC Security, as applicable, will be determined by reference to the Average Metal Sale Price of the underlying Metal held in respect of the ETC Securities sold during the Final Redemption Disposal Period or Early Redemption Disposal Period, as applicable, by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (or any successor or replacement) as ""Metal Agent"", net of associated deductions and taxes. The Issuer will, on or prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date or Scheduled Early Redemption Date, publish the determination of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, (which shall include publication of the price, volume and date of each sale of underlying Metal during the relevant redemption disposal period, including information on any fees, deductions and/or taxes imposed on such sale, and the determination of the Average Metal Sale Price) on the website maintained on behalf of the Issuer at www.etf.dws.com (or such other website notified by the Issuer for the ETC Securities from time to time). The Metal Agent will pay the aggregate proceeds of such disposals (converted, if necessary, into the currency of the ETC Securities) to the cash account for the Series (the ""Series Cash Account"") maintained by J.P. Morgan SE as ""Account Bank"" as directed by the Programme Administrator (defined below). The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest. On early or final redemption of the ETC Securities, a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security, as the case may be. The ETC Securities are subject to a product fee that accrues on a daily basis. Accrued product fee is paid by a daily reduction in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security which, as a result of such reduction, operates as a charge on securityholders. The Issuer will, using the Metal Agent, periodically realise Metal equal to such charge and the proceeds will be credited to the Series Cash Account maintained by the Account Bank in relation to the ETC Securities and used by the Issuer to pay the product fee to the Programme Administrator in accordance with the Programme Administrator Agreement. Such realisation will happen on a periodic (typically weekly) basis. The Programme Administrator Agreement provides that the Programme Administrator will use the product fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities to pay on behalf of the Issuer the costs of the Programme (as set out in the schedule to the Programme Administrator Agreement) relating to such Series of ETC Securities and the Issuer more generally. The ETC Securities may become due and payable prior to their Scheduled Maturity Date in connection with the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) certain legal or regulatory changes occur in relation to the Issuer and the Issuer gives a notice of redemption; (ii) any agent in relation to the ETC Securities resigns or their appointment is terminated and the Issuer gives notice that no successor or replacement has been appointed within a 60 calendar day period; (iii) the Value per ETC Security is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price as at the series issue date for two consecutive valuation days and the determination agent gives the relevant notice; (iv) the Issuer will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, be required to make a payment in respect of VAT or be required to account for VAT in respect of a delivery of Metal from or to an authorised participant (whether or not such VAT is recoverable); (v) an Issuer Call Redemption Event occurs (as discussed further below under ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""); (vi) the Issuer becomes entitled to serve a VAT redemption event notice and the Trustee gives the relevant notice as directed by the requisite number of securityholders; or (vii) an event of default occurs under the ETC Securities. These include certain breaches by the Issuer of its obligations that are not cured within the applicable cure period and certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer. The Issuer may elect to redeem the ETC Securities early on giving not less than 30 calendar days' notice to securityholders (an ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""). The ETC Securities will rank equally amongst themselves. The rights of securityholders are limited in recourse to the Secured Property. As such, once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed, none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors, officers, members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and, therefore, the rights of securityholders will rank in accordance therewith. As a result of such provisions, the securityholders may not receive in full the final redemption amount or early redemption amount payable in respect of an ETC Security. All payments in respect of the ETC Securities shall be made net of and after allowance for any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes. In the event that any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes applies to payments in respect of the ETC Securities, securityholders will be subject to such tax or deduction and shall not be entitled to receive amounts to compensate for any such tax or deduction. No event of default will occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction. The ETC Securities will be governed by the laws of Ireland. There will be two security deeds relating to the ETC Securities; one will be governed by the laws of Ireland and the other will be governed by English law.

The ETC Securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") or under the securities law of any state or political sub-division of the United States of America or any of its territories, possessions or other areas subject to its jurisdiction including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Issuer has not been and will not be registered under any federal laws of the United States of America. The ETC Securities include ETC Securities in bearer form that are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. No person has registered nor will register as a commodity pool operator of the Issuer under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the ""CEA"") and the rules thereunder (the ""CFTC Rules"") of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the ""CFTC""). Any offer or sale of the ETC Securities must be made in an offshore transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Regulation S thereunder (""Regulation S""). The ETC Securities may not at any time be offered, sold or otherwise transferred in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, persons who are either (a) U.S. persons as defined in Regulation S or (b) persons who do not come within the definition of a non-United States person under CFTC Rule 4.7 (excluding for the purposes of subsection (d) thereof, the exception to the extent it would apply to persons who are not non-United States persons).

· The amount payable in respect of the ETC Securities is linked to the performance of the underlying Metal. Prices of precious metals are generally more volatile than prices in other asset classes. If the value of such underlying Metal falls that will reduce amounts payable in respect of the ETC Securities. · The Value per ETC Security, secondary market price and the redemption amount of ETC Securities will primarily be affected by the performance and level of the underlying Metal, rate movements, market perception, the creditworthiness of the Metal Agent, the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian and any applicable sub-custodian and liquidity in the ETC Securities. · The securityholders and other transaction parties will have recourse only to the Secured Property in respect of the ETC Securities and not to any other assets of the Issuer. If, following realisation in full of the Secured Property relating to the ETC Securities, any outstanding claim remains unpaid, then such claim will be extinguished and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect thereof. · The Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is subject to the deduction of the product fee. · The Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount (if any) operates as a minimum repayment amount on the early or final redemption of the ETC Securities. However, in the event that the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is insufficient to fund the Minimum Debt Principal Amount payable in respect of each ETC Security to all securityholders on such early or final redemption, such securityholders may not receive payment of the Minimum Debt Principal Amount in full and may receive substantially less. · The Issuer and securityholders are exposed to the credit risk of the Metal Agent, the Programme Administrator (defined below), the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian, the Account Bank, and any sub-custodian and the authorised participants. · Any disruption to a price source or relevant association may affect the Value per ETC Security and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security. · Certain events may lead to an early redemption of the ETC Securities. · ETC Securities may have a long term and the only means through which an investor can realise value from an ETC Security prior to its Scheduled Maturity Date is to sell it at its then market price in a secondary market transaction. While each authorised participant may make a market for the ETC Securities, no authorised participant is obliged to make a market for any series of ETC Securities and an authorised participant may discontinue making a market at any time. Furthermore, any market in ETC Securities may not be liquid and the secondary market price (if any) for ETC Securities may be substantially less than the price paid by the investor. · With respect to any redemption disposal period, if the proceeds from the realisation of the underlying Metal would cause the balance standing to the Series Cash Account to exceed the maximum amount that can be held during the period between December and January of each calendar year (such amount and such period to be agreed from time to time between the Issuer, the Programme Administrator and the Account Bank (the ""Year-End Period"")), then the Programme Administrator may postpone the redemption date until after the Year-End Period, during which time the Metal Agent will not deposit such proceeds into the Series Cash Account and interest equal to the Specified Interest Amount will not accrue on such proceeds for so long as they are not deposited into the Series Cash Account.

1142083390,20231123,"BRUSSELS – Hungary is set to receive 900 million euros ($981 million) in European Union money, the EU's executive arm said Thursday, despite the Hungarian prime minister’s attempts to scupper the bloc’s support for Ukraine.

That money comes from the bloc’s REPowerEU program aimed at helping the 27 EU nations recover from the energy crisis that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, and reduce their dependance to Russian fossil fuels.

The proposal to unlock the money in pre-financing came as Orban - a frequent critic of the EU and often at odds with European leaders over his government’s record on the rule of law - threatens to derail Ukraine's ambition to join the bloc, and to block the disbursement of a planned 50 billion euros ($54.5 billion) in aid to Kyiv.

EU leaders will meet in Brussels next month to discuss the opening of formal negotiations on Ukraine's future accession.

EU member countries have now four weeks to endorse the European Commission’s decision and greenlight the disbursement of money.

The total value of the Hungary’s post-pandemic recovery plan, which includes the REPowerEU chapter, totals 10.4 billion euros ($11.3 billion) in loans and grants. The Commission insisted that Hungary must achieve rule of law reforms for the bulk of that money to be released.

“The Commission will authorize regular disbursements based on the satisfactory completion of the reforms to ensure the protection of the Union’s financial interests, and to strengthen judicial independence, as translated into 27 ‘super milestones,’” the Commission said in a statement.

Hungary, a large recipient of EU funds, has come under increasing criticism for veering away from democratic norms. The Commission has for nearly a decade accused Orban of dismantling democratic institutions, taking control of the media and infringing on minority rights. Orban, who has been in office since 2010, denies the accusations.

Orban has also repeatedly angered the EU since Russia started its war in Ukraine last year. He has criticized the sanctions adopted by member countries against Russia as being largely ineffective and counter-productive, and last month met Vladimir Putin in a rare in-person meeting for the Russian president with a leader of a European Union country.

Last December, the EU froze billions of euros in cohesion funds allocated to Hungary over its failure to implement solid rule-of-law reforms. Although Hungary insists it doesn't link EU funds to other issues, many in Brussels see its veto threats regarding aid to Ukraine as Orban's bid to blackmail the bloc into releasing billions in regular EU funds and pandemic recovery cash that has been held up.

The Commission also gave a positive assessment of Poland’s revised recovery plan earlier this week, paving the way for the payment of 5.1 billion euros ($5.56 billion) to Warsaw. The announcement came a month after an election in Poland secured a parliamentary majority to pro-EU parties aligned with Donald Tusk, who is expected to become Poland’s next prime minister. He traveled to Brussels last month to meet with top officials and repair Warsaw’s ties with the bloc, aiming to unlock funds that have been frozen due to democratic backsliding under the outgoing nationalist government."
1142083391,20231123,
1142083398,20231123,"NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg conducted a quick tour of the delicate Western Balkans region this week. But what is the military alliance trying to do?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wrapped up a tour of Western Balkan countries this week, in a show of support for and engagement in a region with fires on multiple security fronts.

 

 ""This region is strategically important to NATO, but there are reasons for concern,"" Stoltenberg said at a press conference in the North Macedonian capital of Skopje on Wednesday at the end of his trip. ""We see secessionist threats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a fragile security situation in Kosovo and stalled normalization between Belgrade and Pristina.""

Since the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, NATO has played a major security role in the region. It intervened in Bosnia and Kosovo in the bloody wars that marked the eventual breakdown of Yugoslavia into separate states. Today, three of the six Western Balkan states are in NATO (Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia), and three are not (Serbia, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina).

Hostilities are on the rise between minority ethnic Serbs and majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, which was a province of Serbia during Yugoslav times but broke away and declared independence in 2008 following a bloody war in the 1990s. The United States and 22 of the 27 EU states recognize its statehood, while Serbia and Russia regard it as a breakaway province.

In May, troops from the NATO-led KFOR peacekeeping force were injured trying to manage ethnic Serb-Albanian clashes in northern Kosovo, close to the Serbian border. Kosovo Serbs are often highly distrustful of national authorities and retain close relations with Serbia. In September, four people were left dead after a gunfight between ethnic Serbs, who had barricaded themselves in a monastery, and Kosovo authorities.

As a result, NATO has sent around 1,000 extra troops to Kosovo and stepped up patrols in the predominantly Serb north. This takes KFOR's troop total to more than 4,500, according to news agency Reuters.

Speaking on Monday in the capital Pristina, Stoltenberg said NATO would ""do what is necessary to maintain a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all people in Kosovo.""

""We are now reviewing whether we should have a more permanent increase to ensure that this doesn't spiral out of control and creates a new violent conflict in Kosovo or the wider region,"" he said.

Meanwhile in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the multiethnic state's two political entities, the Republika Srpska, has been threatening to secede. Republika Srpska makes up about half of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is home to some 1.2 million people, mostly ethnic Serbs. It was also formed during the violent breakdown of Yugoslavia and in a context of bloody war.



 The EU, which leads a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is unpopular in Republika Srpska. Instead, the entity has close ties with Serbia and Russia. The EU forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina took over from a NATO mission in 2004.

With various fires smoldering, Stoltenberg's statement in Skopje at the end of his tour on Wednesday was delivered alongside leaders from four Balkan NATO allies — Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia — and aimed partially at Moscow.

NATO sees Russia as playing a destabilizing role, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine.

""Authoritarian states like Russia seek to undermine our democracies with cyber and hybrid threats,"" Stoltenberg, who is tipped to soon leave his post at the head of the Western military alliance, said.

As Bojana Zoric of the European Union Institute for Security Studies explained, in general Russia's aim in the region is to stop the expansion of NATO and the absorption of states into the EU.

 

 The war in Ukraine has also served to underline existing divisions, the analyst from the EU funded research agency said: ""The Western Balkans is not unified when it comes to the response to the war in Ukraine.""

This was to Moscow's advantage.

""Russia always wants to seize any opportunity it has to produce disorder and to inflame hostilities in the region and in a way use ethnic fractures to its own benefit,"" Zoric told DW.

What was Stoltenberg trying to achieve on his trip?

For Zoric, Stoltenberg's trip was mainly about sending ""a clear message to the region and other actors present and involved, including Russia, that NATO remains strongly committed to ensuring security.""

A greater NATO presence in Kosovo ought to encourage all sides to show restraint and therefore hopefully support the reinvigoration of effective normalization dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade, she said.



 Serbia, which aspires to be part of the EU but not NATO, would itself not risk conflict with the military alliance, Zoric said. Most EU states are in NATO. These days, Belgrade has stable relations with NATO, according to the analyst.

What's the risk of further conflict?

The analyst doesn't see a danger of overt confrontation on the horizon, however.

""Not even now or in the near future will Russia be able to afford entering a war on the Western Balkan front, particularly having in mind the fact that half of the Western Balkans is in NATO,"" Zoric said.

Instead, Moscow would be more likely to continue with its current modus operandi of encouraging disorder by working with key regional interlocutors, she argued."
1142097475,20231123,"At least 11 schools, predominantly PA-operated, openly glorified the horrific event through various activities, rallies, and teaching methods

A new report by IMPACT-se has uncovered disturbing revelations about West Bank schools, primarily under the Palestinian Authority (PA), celebrating the October 7 Hamas massacre in southern Israel.

At least 11 schools, predominantly PA-operated, openly glorified the horrific event through various activities, rallies, and teaching methods. These schools perpetuate hatred, violence, and antisemitism within their curriculum.

The report shed light on the disconcerting reality that international aid, particularly from the European Union (EU), is a primary financial pillar sustaining PA education.

Contributions via the EU's PEGASE funding mechanism directly finance the salaries of PA education sector staff and contribute to curriculum development. This funding, which amounts to around 220 million EUR annually, inadvertently aids in promoting a curriculum that advocates violence and incites animosity against Israel.

Several instances documented in the report exemplify the extent of the glorification of violence within these educational institutions. Schools like the Ya’bad Secondary Boys School and Fadwa Touqan Mixed Elementary School in Nablus actively endorsed the October 7 massacre, closing school in honor of the event and allowing second-grade students to draw Hamas terrorists as part of their activities.

Further examples from Azzun Elementary School for Boys in Qalqilya showcased grade 4 students singing hateful lyrics, and at the Rafedeen Mixed Elementary School in South Hebron, a video revealed a fourth-grade student reciting a poem advocating for violence.

The report highlighted the problematic content within the PA curriculum taught in these schools. It consistently includes narratives of violence, glorification of terrorism, and the demonization of Israel.

The curriculum notably omits any mention of peace with Israel and doesn’t acknowledge Israel on any maps, perpetuating a one-sided and aggressive narrative.

Marcus Sheff, the CEO of IMPACT-se, expressed serious concerns about the dire consequences of continuing to fund these schools.

""Schools operated by the Palestinian Authority are teaching the same curriculum as that studied by the thousands of October 7 terrorists from Gaza, and are publicly celebrating the unspeakable atrocities,"" Sheff said.

""It is critical that not a single cent of international aid, including European Union funds, continues to fuel this deadly process of murderous indoctrination."""
1142099835,20231123,"BELGRADE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Serbia has acquired 11 Russian-made Mi35 helicopter gunships from Cyprus as it seeks to bolster its air force and maintain regional military supremacy, country's President Aleksandar Vucic said on Thursday.

The Cypriot government and Serbia agreed in 2021 the purchase of ageing Mi35s that require an overhaul, for an unspecified price part of which Belgrade paid by exporting Serbian-made weapons.

""We have paid more than half to our Cypriot brothers with our weapons ... mainly ... artillery,"" Vucic told reporters at a presentation at the Batajnica military air base near Belgrade.

He also announced a sale of 48 Serbian-made self propelled howitzers worth a total of 311 million euros ($339 million) to an unspecified country. ""This procedure must still go through their parliament,"" Vucic said. Serbia, a candidate to join the European Union that has one of the largest armies in the Western Balkans, still relies on ex-Soviet military technology, but in recent years it started purchases of Western and Chinese weapon systems and aircraft.

In June, Vucic said Belgrade was negotiating the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France's Dassault. Serbia has already bought Airbus helicopters and transport planes.

Serbia is militarily neutral, but it joined the NATO Partnership for Peace, a programme for countries which do not aspire to join the alliance.

Belgrade curtailed military co-operation with Moscow after Russia invaded Ukraine and has condemned the invasion. But unlike the EU and other Western countries, it has not imposed sanctions on Moscow.

Serbia's military budget amounts to $1.43 billion or 2% of gross domestic product (GDP)."
1142094204,20231123,"OUAGADOUGOU – In a significant step towards combating climate change, the European Union (EU) is turning to digital technologies to meet its ambitious energy efficiency targets. The EU’s revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) focuses on leveraging digital solutions to reduce energy consumption, particularly in the building sector, which accounts for a substantial portion of the EU’s energy use and CO2 emissions.

According to World Economic Forum, the buildings sector in the EU is a major energy consumer, responsible for about 40% of energy consumption and 27% of carbon dioxide emissions. To address this, the EU has set a target to reduce energy consumption by 11.7% by 2030, based on a 2020 reference scenario. The International Energy Agency underscores the importance of this initiative, noting that doubling progress on energy efficiency could significantly lower CO2 emissions from fuel combustion.

The newly revised EED, which entered into force in October, gives EU member states two years to implement these policies nationally. A notable aspect of the directive is its focus on data centres and public buildings, recognizing the growing energy demands of the digital age.

Data centres, vital for powering web-based technologies, are particularly energy-intensive, operating continuously and requiring consistent power supply. The EED introduces new obligations for larger data centres to report on their energy performance and mandates waste heat recovery initiatives.

For instance, Estonia’s Greenergy data centre, which runs on renewable energy, exemplifies the benefits of digitalization in energy management. It utilizes an integrated data management software to optimize energy usage, particularly in cooling and ventilation, which can account for a significant portion of a data centre’s energy consumption.

The directive also targets the renovation of public buildings, with member states required to renovate 3% of floorspace in publicly-owned buildings annually. New audit and energy management obligations based on energy consumption will drive change across various sectors, including data centres.

In France, the government’s energy regulations for buildings have been adapted to meet these sustainability goals. French energy services company IDEX has collaborated with Siemens to collect and manage sensor data more efficiently across the country.

1142094207,20231123,"On 16 November 2023, a French court issued a warrant for the arrest of Bashar al-Assad, the incumbent president of Syria. Al-Assad stands accused of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The allegations against him and several others involve the use of chemical weapons, specifically the nerve agent sarin. The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, 1993 bans the production and stockpiling of sarin.

The warrant for Al-Assad has rightly been described in The Guardian as a historic moment. The warrant marks a significant step towards achieving justice for the victims of the chemical attacks in the Ghouta region in August 2013. It is one of few ever issued against a head of state, whether incumbent or past. The warrant signals an intention to enforce international criminal law against the most powerful political actors, even those traditionally considered immune from criminal prosecution.

The oddity is how the English press appears fixated on this European moment. The Guardian reported that campaigners for international justice “believed” this “to be the first time a sitting head of state has been the subject of an arrest warrant in another country for crimes against humanity”.

But that overlooks many such developments elsewhere, particularly in the Global South, as it has come to be called. For example, South Africa is no stranger to warrants for the arrest of heads of state accused of international crimes.

Eight years before the warrant for Al-Assad, in 2015, a South African magistrate issued a warrant for the arrest of Omar al-Bashir, the then-incumbent president of Sudan. South Africa, despite its duty to enforce a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), allowed al-Bashir to flee South Africa. Al-Bashir stood accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. South Africa was hauled before the ICC to explain its failure to do its duty.

Earlier this year, and only after much dithering and prevaricating by government about its duty to arrest a wanted war criminal, the Pretoria high court ordered that South Africa is legally obliged to arrest Vladimir Putin, the current president of Russia. As with Al-Bashir, South Africa’s duty to arrest Putin arose from the ICC’s decision to issue a warrant for Putin’s arrest.

Putin stands accused of the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia. Shortly after the high court made its order, the South African government announced that Putin would not attend the BRICS Summit held in Johannesburg, and it confirmed that it had endorsed an ICC warrant for Putin’s arrest.

The Al-Assad arrest warrant differs in at least one material way from the two warrants for Al-Bashir and Putin. The French court has decided that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute Al-Assad domestically. The warrant for Al-Assad’s arrest is not to secure his presence before the ICC. The warrant is to secure his presence before the courts in France.

France has decided to exercise its universal jurisdiction over international crimes. That is, France has decided to exercise its power to prosecute an international crime, even though the crime occurred outside of France’s territory.

South Africa could take similar decisions. Under the Implementation of the Rome Statute Act, South Africa has domesticated the ICC statute and has the power to exercise jurisdiction over international crimes committed anywhere in the world.

The fact that a person is or was a head of state is neither a defence to an international crime nor a ground for reduction of sentence once convicted of a crime. South Africa’s prosecuting authority and (if an appropriate case is established) courts can decide to prosecute persons who commit international crimes, even if those crimes are outside of South Africa and even if committed by heads of state.

The issue for both South Africa and France, as illustrated by the Al-Bashir and Putin sagas, is the enforcement of that jurisdiction. Deciding to prosecute an incumbent head of state is one thing; securing their presence before a court is another.

But even before those practical difficulties, are the political ones: the Al-Bashir saga demonstrates how an absence of political will, or the existence of the wrong kind of political will, can result in the subversion of international criminal law.

Prosecuting an incumbent head of state, given their political power, is a tough task. Shy of a political ousting, as for example with Slobodan Milošević, the prospects of arresting and trying a sitting head of state are slim.

Nonetheless, civil society and French, South African and other courts are left to ensure consistency and to demand rule of law accountability for all those who commit atrocity crimes. As the Putin arrest warrant showed, decisions to prosecute heads of state are not inconsequential. Putin, ultimately, could not travel to South Africa.

By a high court order in Pretoria, far more than any wilful action on the part of the government, Putin was reduced to addressing an audience of senior state officials via Zoom from Russia. He similarly cannot travel to any country party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court without attracting a risk of arrest.

For Al-Assad, the risk is similar in kind. He cannot travel in Europe since the French arrest warrant would ordinarily be enforceable anywhere in the European Union. He similarly cannot travel to any country where he might face the risk of extradition, like those countries (including South Africa) party to the European Convention on Extradition, 1957.

Whether it is Al-Assad, or Putin, or any other alleged war criminal, the lesson is clear. The world is increasingly a hostile place for those who unlawfully perpetrate hostilities on civilians, neighbours, children, and the vulnerable.

A French court issuing an arrest warrant for Al-Assad stands alongside the world shrinking for the Putins and Al-Bashirs who commit atrocities and think themselves untouchable. International criminal justice, for all its other problems, now increasingly allows the sending of a message that implicated leaders are not welcome: of making the world a smaller place, a riskier place to travel freely, for those that commit or abet crimes that offend our common humanity.

It is also important that this work is done globally. By joint approaches through French, South African, and other courts committed to universal jurisdiction, the principle of accountability is strengthened and its reach extended. DM

1142094210,20231123,"Hungary is set to receive 900 million euros ($981 million) in European Union money, the EU's executive arm said Thursday, despite the Hungarian prime minister’s attempts to scupper the bloc’s support for Ukraine.

That money comes from the bloc’s REPowerEU program aimed at helping the 27 EU nations recover from the energy crisis that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, and reduce their dependance to Russian fossil fuels.

The proposal to unlock the money in pre-financing came as Orban - a frequent critic of the EU and often at odds with European leaders over his government’s record on the rule of law - threatens to derail Ukraine's ambition to join the bloc, and to block the disbursement of a planned 50 billion euros ($54.5 billion) in aid to Kyiv.

EU leaders will meet in Brussels next month to discuss the opening of formal negotiations on Ukraine's future accession.

EU member countries have now four weeks to endorse the European Commission’s decision and greenlight the disbursement of money.

The total value of the Hungary’s post-pandemic recovery plan, which includes the REPowerEU chapter, totals 10.4 billion euros ($11.3 billion) in loans and grants. The Commission insisted that Hungary must achieve rule of law reforms for the bulk of that money to be released.

“The Commission will authorize regular disbursements based on the satisfactory completion of the reforms to ensure the protection of the Union’s financial interests, and to strengthen judicial independence, as translated into 27 ‘super milestones,’” the Commission said in a statement.

Hungary, a large recipient of EU funds, has come under increasing criticism for veering away from democratic norms. The Commission has for nearly a decade accused Orban of dismantling democratic institutions, taking control of the media and infringing on minority rights. Orban, who has been in office since 2010, denies the accusations.

Orban has also repeatedly angered the EU since Russia started its war in Ukraine last year. He has criticized the sanctions adopted by member countries against Russia as being largely ineffective and counter-productive, and last month met Vladimir Putin in a rare in-person meeting for the Russian president with a leader of a European Union country.

Last December, the EU froze billions of euros in cohesion funds allocated to Hungary over its failure to implement solid rule-of-law reforms. Although Hungary insists it doesn't link EU funds to other issues, many in Brussels see its veto threats regarding aid to Ukraine as Orban's bid to blackmail the bloc into releasing billions in regular EU funds and pandemic recovery cash that has been held up.

The Commission also gave a positive assessment of Poland’s revised recovery plan earlier this week, paving the way for the payment of 5.1 billion euros ($5.56 billion) to Warsaw. The announcement came a month after an election in Poland secured a parliamentary majority to pro-EU parties aligned with Donald Tusk, who is expected to become Poland’s next prime minister. He traveled to Brussels last month to meet with top officials and repair Warsaw’s ties with the bloc, aiming to unlock funds that have been frozen due to democratic backsliding under the outgoing nationalist government."

1142102408,20231123,"The two chemicals in question – homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate – are ultraviolet light filters that are solely used as ingredients in sunscreens.

Animal testing was banned​ in Europe in March 2009, but there is a regulation based around worker exposure​ to certain chemicals in the EU’s REACH​ regulation, which can be at odds with the testing ban.

According to animal protection NGO Cruelty Free Europe (CFE), the toxicity testing of the two chemicals that's required by ECHA will involve over 5,500 animals, including rats, rabbits and fish, being force-fed the ingredients in tests before being killed and dissected.

Cruelty Free Europe member, Cruelty Free International, was allowed to intervene in the appeals on behalf of Symrise AG and said the decision “renders the European Union and United Kingdom bans on animal testing for cosmetics virtually meaningless.”​

The interplay between REACH and Cosmetics Regulation​

However, in response to Cruelty Free Europe’s comments, the ECHA has highlighted its position in terms of balancing the EU’s REACH worker safety regulation with Cosmetics Regulation.

It said: “The court has issued its judgment, and we welcome its outcome. It confirms how the European Commission and ECHA have interpreted the interplay between the current REACH and current Cosmetics Regulation.​

To make sure that workers are not at risk, REACH requires safety data on the properties of chemicals they handle, regardless of if substances are used for cosmetics. To protect the health of workers, animal testing may be required under REACH.​

REACH requires companies to use alternative methods whenever possible before conducting animal tests. ECHA promotes the use of alternative methods and plays a role in verifying if new animal testing proposed by companies is needed.​

Animal tests are only needed if there is no alternative way to demonstrate safe use of chemicals.”​

Symrise itself said it acknowledged the decision from the European Court of Justice regarding the cases T-655/20 and T-656/20. ""We appreciate that this brings clarity to the subject matter. It is a fundamentally important event for Symrise that the European Court of Justice has now decided on, ​which we of course respect,"" said a spokesperson for the company.

""Due to the complexity of the legal proceedings, we are currently unable to make any substantive statements. We will now perform a deeper analysis of the verdict to determine potential further actions.""​

The ruling against Symrise acknowledges that, under Article 25 of REACH, manufacturers should “generate information obtained by means other than animal testing ‘whenever possible’ and to undertake such testing ‘only as a last resort’” – therefore when there are no non-animal alternatives.

However, Cruelty Free Europe said that it believed that the General Court's decision has not aligned with this.

“In fact, the testing bans in the Cosmetics Regulation apply irrespective of whether there are alternatives,”​ the NGO said in a statement.

“The Court, wrongly in CFI’s view, sidestepped a provision in REACH which says that the REACH testing requirements apply ‘without prejudice’ to the cosmetics bans – in other words, those bans should take precedence. The ruling therefore turns on its head what EU citizens have been promised. The cosmetics bans were introduced before REACH – hence the need for the ‘without prejudice’ clause.”​

In 2018, the ECHA told Symrise AG that they were required to test these chemicals on animals.

The German chemicals company then undertook an initial appeal, which was held in 2021, but was dismissed by ECHA’s Board of Appeal. Symrise AG then took its case to the General Court.

Over 1.2 million people recently signing a ‘Save Cruelty Free Cosmetics’ European Citizens’ Initiative, which was launched in August 2021 by a coalition of European animal protection groups including Cruelty Free Europe.

In response to this demand, the European Commission said it would start to plan the total phase-out of animal testing for all chemicals.

Cruelty Free Europe’s Director of Science and Regulatory Affairs, Dr Emma Grange, said: “This decision is a huge backwards step in our fight to stop animals suffering and dying in the name of beauty. The existing bans, which have been in place in the UK for 25 years and European Union for two decades, are now virtually meaningless, as this case will set a damaging precedent in toxicity testing for cosmetics ingredients, even if they have been approved as safe for use for many years.”​

On the topic of animal testing for cosmetics, ​Cosmetics Design-Europe​ recently spoke to the CEO​ of Swedish life sciences company SenzaGen who said he believed that there is still plenty of unnecessary animal testing going on across the world.

The game-changing business has developed technology based on genomics and human tissue models, which it said has been shown to give more reliable results than testing on animals and could potentially be an alternative option for cosmetics companies."

1142102410,20231123,"This comes after South Korea suspended part of the military accord due to North Korea's recent space rocket launch.

North Korea announced it would restore ""all military measures"" halted under a 2018 inter-Korean deal after South Korea suspended a portion of the accord in response to the North's spy satellite launch on Nov. 21.

The ministry warned that South Korea ""must pay dearly"" for escalating military tensions on the Korean Peninsula to ""an uncontrollable phase.""

""We will withdraw the military steps taken to prevent military tension and conflict in all spheres, including ground, sea, and air, and deploy more powerful armed forces and new-type military hardware in the region along the military demarcation line,"" it stated.

The military accord was signed by former South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018 to end hostilities between their nations.

Termination of the deal could result in the resumption of live-fire drills along the demarcation line separating the two Koreas. South Korea suspended part of the accord that limits its reconnaissance and surveillance operations along the demarcation line after North Korea defied warnings against launching a spy satellite.

Defense chief Shin Won-sik has called the move ""a corresponding response to North Korea's provocation,"" saying that South Korea had only taken ""a minimal defensive measure.""

""Therefore, the partial suspension of the agreement is an essential measure to protect people's lives and safety,"" he remarked.

This marked North Korea's third launch after two failed attempts on May 31 and Aug. 24.

Japan's defense ministry said the projectile disintegrated into pieces, one of which landed in the Pacific Ocean about 746 miles southwest of Japan's Okinotori Island.

Another part of the projectile fell into the East China Sea, around 217 miles off the Korean Peninsula.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it assessed that North Korea's spy satellite entered orbit but that more analysis and time are needed to determine whether the satellite is functioning properly.

They said the launch posed “a grave threat” to the region and beyond and violated the United Nations Security Council Resolutions prohibiting North Korea from launching any ballistic missile technology.

“North Korea cannot and will never have the status of a nuclear-weapon State under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,” the statement reads.

The G7 foreign ministers called for a “swift, united, and robust international response” to North Korea’s space launch and urged the regime to return to dialogue.

The United States called on all countries to condemn North Korea's illegal space launch and urged Pyongyang to return to ""serious negotiations,"" Ms. Watson said in a statement.

""The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its provocative actions and instead choose engagement,"" the spokesperson stated.

""The United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and the defense of our Republic of Korea and Japanese allies,"" she added.

North Korea has carried out a series of missile tests since 2022, with some involving nuclear-capable missiles that can strike the United States."
1142104896,20231123,"Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak leaves 10 Downing Street for his weekly Prime Ministers Questions at the House of Commons in London, Wednesday, Nov. 22, 2023. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)

LONDON (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced heavy pressure from his own Conservatives to take swift action to bring down migration, as new data published Thursday showed net migration numbers were higher than previously thought.

The Office for National Statistics revised its estimates for net migration to the U.K. — meaning the number of people arriving minus those leaving — in the year to December 2022 to 745,000. That is a new record and significantly higher than the previous estimate of 606,000 for the same period.

The more hard-line wing of the Tories urged Sunak to “act now” as a general election looms next year.

“The word ‘existential’ has been used a lot in recent days but this really is ‘do or die’ for our party,” said a statement by a group of lawmakers known as the “New Conservatives.” “Each of us made a promise to the electorate. We don’t believe that such promises can be ignored.""

Suella Braverman, the hard-line, anti-immigration former home secretary who was fired by Sunak this month, joined in the criticism.

“Today’s record numbers are a slap in the face to the British public who have voted to control and reduce migration at every opportunity,” she said.

The Conservatives were reelected in 2019 on the back of a manifesto to “take back our borders"" and break away from the constraints of the European Union. Britain completed its divorce with the trade bloc in 2020.

Migration continues to be a political hot potato, although Sunak's government has focused less on legal migration than the issue of unauthorized asylum-seekers arriving on small boats across the English Channel.

The latest figures do show that net migration in the 12 months up to June 2023 decreased to 672,000. The Office for National Statistics said that it was too early to tell if that's the start of a new downward trend.

Sunak's office at Downing Street said that net migration remained “far too high” and indicated that further measures could be introduced to bring down the figures. Authorities said in May that foreign postgraduate students can no longer bring family members to the U.K. from next year as part of efforts to curb immigration.

Officials said they revised the 2022 figures upwards because patterns and behaviors have been shifting and less predictable than before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.

Jay Lindop, director of the international migration department at the statistics office, said the main drivers of the increase were people arriving from non-EU countries for study and work, particularly in Britain's health and social care sectors.

Britain also took in hundreds of thousands of people who fled Russia's war in Ukraine and the Chinese government's crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, though those numbers have slowed in recent months.

“Net migration to the U.K. has been running at record levels, driven by a rise in people coming for work, increasing numbers of students and a series of world events,"" he said.

“More recently, we’re not only seeing more students arrive, but we can also see they’re staying for longer. More dependants of people with work and study visas have arrived too, and immigration is now being driven by non-EU arrivals,"" he added.

The latest figures showed that a total of 1.18 million people are estimated to have arrived in the U.K. in the year to June 2023, while 508,000 are estimated to have left, leaving the net migration figure at 672,000.

Sunak's Conservatives have trailed behind the opposition Labour Party in national polls for months. However, polls suggest that the economy and inflation, rather than migration, are the top concerns for voters."
1142110306,20231123,"Helsinki (AFP) – Growing numbers of asylum-seeking migrants have in recent weeks been crossing the once quiet border from Russia into Finland in freezing temperatures, a move Helsinki has labelled a hybrid attack.

A Finnish border guard escorts migrants at the border with Russia

Cloaked in heavy winter coats, many have been arriving on bicycles, attempting to bypass a ban on crossing the border on foot. Finland barred entry by bicycle last week.

In early October, the Finnish border guard raised the alarm about a shift in Moscow's policy, saying Russia was allowing an increasing number of migrants without proper papers to reach the border.

Since August, around 700 asylum seekers have entered Finland without a visa over its 1,300-kilometre (800-mile) border with Russia.

This prompted Finland, over the past week, to close all but its northernmost border crossing with Russia, in the Murmansk region.

Finnish officials claim Russia is attempting to destabilise its Nordic neighbour.

""This is a systematic and organised action by the Russian authorities,"" Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said Monday.

""Finnish authorities are beginning to make clumsy excuses, warming up Russophobic sentiments,"" she said.

Finland's traditionally cordial relationship with its eastern neighbour has soured since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

After Finland reversed its decades-long policy of military non-alignment and joined NATO in April, Moscow warned of ""countermeasures.""

""Russia and the West, including Finland, are in a very deep conflict,"" said Arkady Moshes, Russia Programme Director at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs (FIIA).

""Weaponising migration is one of the instruments"" Russia possesses.

Moshes said there were ""parallels"" to the Belarus-EU border crisis in 2021.

The EU has claimed President Alexander Lukashenko pushed tens of thousands of migrants across the Belarus border to Poland in retaliation for sanctions.

""The actions of the Finnish government show that the experience of Poland has been taken into account,"" Moshes said.

The European Union's border protection agency Frontex said Thursday it will deploy 50 officers to Finland, to help boost the country's border controls.

Poland toughened its border to resolve the crisis and Finnish authorities are aiming to do the same.

Anticipating that Moscow could use migrants as political pressure, Finland in February began building a 200-kilometre (124-mile) fence along its Russian border.

But only three kilometres of the fence is finished.

In terms of information warfare, pushing people to the Finnish border is potentially ""a double-win situation for Russia,"" Moshes said.

Finland is left with two bad options: It can either keep the border open and accept the migrants, or close the border completely.

""If Finland does not close its border... that will show that the West is weak"" in Russia's eyes, Moshes said.

If Finland closes the border, Russia can play the victim and call the response ""a Russophobic action,"" he added.

But the manoeuvre also poses risks for Russia.

The migrants are predominantly from the Middle East and Africa and have no visas.

Pushing migrants to the Finnish side could attract criticism from Russia's allies in the Middle East and the Muslim world.

Moreover, as long as the migrants are on Russian territory, Russia bears responsibility for feeding and housing them.

""Even Lukashenko at the end of the day had to build shelters for those people,"" Moshes explained.

Confronted with growing numbers of migrants freezing at its border, Finland is now grappling with balancing its security concerns and human rights obligations.

""That is certainly one of the objectives of hybrid warfare, to try to undermine the key fundamental institutions of the state,"" University of Eastern Finland law professor Eeva Nykanen said.

Finland's government has considered closing the border, but is conscious of its international obligations.

The availability of locations to seek asylum ""may be limited in exceptional circumstances"" but Finland is obligated to ensure some access points, Nykanen explained.

Even if the border was fully closed, it is uncertain how Finland would deal with those crossing illegally through the wilderness.

From a legal point of view, a migrant is entitled to submit an asylum application even if they enter illegally, Nykanen said.

As temperatures plummet, it could also become ethically intolerable for Finland to witness migrants freezing behind barbed wire fences.

""That would be a humanitarian crisis that would need to be solved,"" Nykanen said."

1142112852,20231123,"The outcome of the Dutch elections could prove to be difficult for the European Union in the long run, after the Eurosceptic, anti-Islam populist Party for Freedom (PVV) won the election with 37 seats.

The number is far from an absolute majority, but it is enough to enable its veteran leader, Geert Wilders, to lead a possible coalition government.

One of his signature proposals during the electoral campaign was a binding referendum on leaving the European Union.

Eric Mamer, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said that they are not worried for now.

""Elections take place at regular intervals in the member states. And this is not per se, putting in doubt in any way the membership of any country to the European Union,"" Mamer told reporters.

""We continue to count on the Netherlands' strong participation in the European Union.""

Even if a so-called 'Nexit' is unlikely to happen, there are three major sources of concern at the EU level if Wilders takes power, according to Doru Frantescu, CEO & founder of think tank EU Matrix.

Firstly, a hard stance on immigration, military aid to Ukraine and the EU’s long-term budget.

“The Dutch government cannot make a U-turn on Ukraine, but still, there will be some difficulties in reaching a consensus,"" he told Euronews.

""Thirdly, I think we could see, with Wilders in power, a much more critical position of the Dutch government when it comes to the budget of the European Union, the multiannual financial framework, which will have to be soon enough negotiated.

""Even with a more pro-European government in the Netherlands, we have seen the Dutch being quite critical, pushing for not increasing the EU budget. Now, with this new government, it can be even more so the case.""

However, Wilders’ party needs at least 76 members of the Parliament to secure a majority and coalition talks will probably take a long time, given that the last Dutch government was formed only 10 months after the elections.

""The big question is whether the Dutch will be able to put together a government before or after the next European election,"" Frantescu said.

""I think that's going to be very important for Europe, especially because the question is who is going to represent the Netherlands next June, July when the new European Commission is going to be set up and the priorities of the new political cycle in Europe will be negotiated.""

He added that the result in the Netherlands is not necessarily a sign of a far-right or Eurosceptic surge in Europe, but rather a trend based on every national outcome depending more on the internal political cycle."
1142115376,20231123,"Big Tech companies have racked up billions of dollars in fines over the last decade, and that number will only continue to grow.

Europe has cracked down on these companies, but in many cases, it can take years for them to pay off the fines.

For example, Ireland fined Facebook’s parent company Meta a total of $2.2 billion and TikTok over $300 million, but neither company has paid.

Amazon is still appealing a $887 million fine from Luxembourg in 2021. Similarly, Google racked up more than $8 billion in EU fines between 2017 and 2019 (for abusing its market power) that it is still disputing today.

The five main Big Tech companies – Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft – are all based in the U.S., and in terms of rules, the laws in Europe are much stricter.

For example, Europe has the General Data Protection Regulation and the Digital Services Act package.

However, these Big Tech companies are motivated to operate on a global scale so they can maximize their reach and customer base.



In the past decade, major Big Tech companies operating in Europe have incurred substantial fines, revealing the stark contrast in regulatory approaches between Europe and the United States. 



The largest fine the U.S. has handed Big Tech took place in 2019 when the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) imposed a staggering $5 billion penalty on Facebook for privacy violations. Facebook ultimately paid the penalty.

The regulatory framework of Big Tech in the U.S. is fragmented.

For example, there are varying finance laws across states that the companies must adhere to, and antitrust laws are overseen by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The bottom line is there is not a centralized federal agency.

Lawmakers have been pushing for stronger oversight with several proposals aimed at addressing competition concerns, antitrust issues, consumer protection laws and net neutrality.

Additionally, proposals have focused on data protection and privacy. Despite these efforts, lawmakers have struggled to legislate around Big Tech, and no laws have been passed that meet the standards set by the European Union."

1142117795,20231123,"ASIATODAY.ID, JAKARTA – The International Partners Group (IPG), co-chaired by the United States and Japan and its members consisting of Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Germany, France, Norway, Italy, and the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, welcomes the launch Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) of Indonesia’s Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP).

Launched in Jakarta Wednesday, 22 November 2023, CIPP is a roadmap for the Indonesian government and IPG to achieve the goals set out in the JETP Joint Statement, announced at last year’s G20 Leaders Summit in Bali.

In this Joint Statement, Indonesia is committed to limiting emissions, accelerating the development of renewable energy, and setting a goal to achieve a zero emissions target in the electricity sector by 2050.

To support this ambitious target, IPG is committed to mobilizing $10 billion in funding and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coordination of leading financial institutions committed to accelerating the zero emissions transition, is committed to mobilizing and facilitating financing an additional $10 billion.

CIPP, which is the culmination of a year’s work, maps the technical path of the electricity sector in Indonesia, recommends policy changes needed for a successful electricity sector transition, and outlines a plan for a just transition. The plan also serves as the basis for pushing $20 billion in JETP funding for specific projects as well as Indonesia’s energy transition priorities.

The CIPP technical design initially focused on the on-grid power generation sector. Under CIPP’s technical plan for solar power generation systems, these systems will produce no more than 250 MT CO2 of carbon dioxide, down from a baseline figure of 305 MT, and will account for 44 percent of renewable energy generation by 2030. The partnership will work together to Complete analysis of the off-grid electricity sector in Indonesia in the coming months. This analysis will be the basis for implementing the steps necessary to achieve a comprehensive energy transition.

The $20 billion funding package will be disbursed through various mechanisms, including through grants, concessional and concessional loans, as well as investments and guarantees. IPG funding will direct support towards priorities and projects identified in the CIPP, including the deployment of renewable energy; transmission and network construction; phasing out and reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants; and just transition initiatives.

As a next step, the Indonesian government and IPG, supported by the JETP Secretariat, will continue to work together to implement CIPP. IPG and GFANZ investors are actively seeking to direct financing to potential JETP projects, and implementation of CIPP policy recommendations in Indonesia will enable a business environment for renewable energy investment.

This combined effort is designed to help catalyze additional investment in Indonesia’s energy transition and drive the growth of Indonesia’s renewable energy sector.

Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Kanasugi Kenji said Japan welcomed the launch of the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan, which shows an ambitious path to clean emissions. The Just Energy Transition Partnership will encourage clean energy and Indonesia’s economic development, which will also contribute to a more sustainable, more prosperous and inclusive global economy and society.

“Japan will continue to lead this JETP with America, in coordination with other partner countries, to support a realistic but ambitious decarbonization transition in Indonesia, while respecting Indonesian state ownership. “Japan will continue to contribute to global decarbonization efforts through various initiatives including JETP,” he said, quoted from a press release from the United States Embassy in Jakarta, Thursday, November 23 2023.

Chargé d’Affaires of the United States Embassy to Indonesia Michael F. Kleine said, Indonesia’s roadmap for reducing carbon emissions – the JETP Indonesia Comprehensive Policy and Investment Plan – is an important milestone that shows Indonesia’s leadership in achieving clean emissions in the electricity sector by 2050 and encouraging growth an economy powered by renewable energy.

Chargé d’Affaires of the Canadian Embassy to Indonesia and Timor-Leste Richard Le Bars said “The launch of the Indonesian Just Energy Transition Partnership’s Comprehensive Policy and Investment Plan demonstrates continued multilateral collaboration in supporting Indonesia’s ambitious steps towards an environmentally friendly energy system and a sustainable future. Canada is committed to continuing this collaboration with Indonesia and other partners, recognizing our shared interests in ensuring an inclusive and clean energy future in Indonesia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.”

Danish Deputy Ambassador to Indonesia, Malaysia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and ASEAN Per Brixen said, “Today’s launch of the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) marks another major step in Indonesia’s green transition. CIPP shows important pathways and steps to achieve a transition to Indonesia’s on-grid electricity sector that is not only environmentally friendly but also fair. Denmark will continue to support Indonesia in building close technical collaboration for more than seven years in the development of renewable energy with the Indonesian Government.”

European Union Ambassador to Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam Denis Chaibi said, “The Indonesian Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan is the start of a transformative path that will enable Indonesia and the European Union to jointly contribute to the global fight against climate change. Through a combination of grants and soft loans, the EU, the European Investment Bank and EU Member States have pledged 3.7 billion dollars for the fossil fuel transition. In the future, we have a special opportunity to work together on CIPP implementation, including off-grid decarbonization pathways.”

French Ambassador to Indonesia, Timor Leste and ASEAN Fabien Penone said “The launch of the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) marks an important milestone in joint efforts to support and accelerate Indonesia’s energy transition in a way that is fair and leaves no one behind, and brings benefits to the Indonesian economy , Indonesian society, and climate. France will continue to maintain close relations with the Indonesian government and international partners to achieve results in line with JETP’s high ambitions.”

German Ambassador to Indonesia Ina Lepel said “Today’s launch of the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) is a major success towards an environmentally friendly energy transition in Indonesia. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany highly appreciates the dedication and ambition of the Government of Indonesia and is committed to providing substantial funding to implement the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). Together, we will shape a future where clean, affordable energy drives progress and preserves our planet for future generations.”

Italian Ambassador to Indonesia Benedetto Latteri said “CIPP will determine the direction of achieving JETP’s goals. We acknowledge the efforts made by the Indonesian Government. Italy is proud to stand by Indonesia’s side on this ambitious path and leverage Italy’s most advanced technology and skills to benefit Indonesia in sustaining its energy transition efforts.”

Norwegian Ambassador to Indonesia Rut Krüger Giverin said, “Norway is very pleased to be able to take part in this partnership and support Indonesia’s efforts to develop environmentally friendly energy and accelerate the energy transition. We believe the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP) will provide a good framework for mobilizing capital to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy in Indonesia. Norway will continue to support Indonesia’s commitment to reducing emissions and fighting climate change.”

British Ambassador to Indonesia and Timor Leste Dominic Jermey said, “I congratulate the Indonesian Government on the successful launch of CIPP today. The plan outlines key steps for the on-grid electricity sector and sets the foundation for future strategies for the off-grid electricity sector. The UK remains a loyal partner in Indonesia’s ambitions for an energy transition. Partners across the domestic spectrum, international community and private sector will be indispensable to help Indonesia achieve its renewable energy and infrastructure investment targets.” (AT Network)

1142120312,20231123,"A major meeting between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and European Union leaders begins Thursday in St. John’s, the capital of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas militants is expected to feature prominently at the two-day EU-Canada Summit, particularly after the two sides announced a hostage truce deal on Wednesday. .

European Union officials say a statement supporting a two-state solution that would result in a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel will likely be an important part of the summit’s joint statement, which is expected at the end of the summit’s discussions. event.

The officials, who offered a briefing to reporters on the condition that their names not be revealed, said the ongoing war in Ukraine is also expected to be an important part of the discussions.

Trade, climate and energy are also on the agenda, as Atlantic Canada seeks to become a major supplier of hydrogen fuel to European markets, particularly Germany.

And the EU is seeking to discuss a possible Canadian contribution to its unarmed mission in Armenia, where civilian observers monitor security along the country’s border with Azerbaijan.

This is the 19th EU-Canada Summit. Meetings between the Canadian prime minister and the two top heads of the 27-nation bloc are held every two years. The last summit took place in 2021, in Brussels.

European officials said it was Trudeau’s decision to hold this year’s summit in Canada’s easternmost province, although they did not say why he chose St. John’s, a city of 530,000.

Newfoundland and Labrador’s seal industry has been hit hard by European bans on seal products. Officials said that could come up in trade discussions, but it was not considered a major issue.

Europe has also applauded Ottawa’s carbon pricing system, although Trudeau has been criticized in Canada for exempting home heating oil from the carbon pricing plan for three years.

Some critics say the move shows carbon pricing is unaffordable for Canadians facing a cost of living crisis, while others say it could undermine the Liberal government’s efforts to limit the impact of climate change.

Officials say the carbon price will come up in discussions about establishing a “green alliance” between Canada and the EU, adding that both governments have committed to expanding the global coverage of the carbon price.

Sven Scholtysik, research director at the non-profit energy organization Net Zero Atlantic, says he will be watching for European countries to reaffirm their commitment to Canada to build a prosperous hydrogen energy partnership.

He said in an interview Wednesday that he was pleased to see the summit include transatlantic hydrogen trade as a point of discussion.

“I would look for a good approach where Atlantic Canada is presented as a region and as the region closest to Germany,” Scholtysik said.

“Atlantic Canada and the EU are not far away, and we can mutually act as long-term strategic partners in the energy system transition.”

Trudeau signed a hydrogen deal with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last year in the western Newfoundland town of Stephenville, one of several areas in Atlantic Canada where companies are racing to build huge hydrogen and ammonia plants powered by wind power.

The goal for most is to ship hydrogen, in the form of ammonia, to Germany, where there is a significant market for greener forms of energy.

One project led by EverWind Fuels has already passed the environmental assessment process in Nova Scotia and another, led by World Energy GH2, is in the final stages of that process in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Both companies intend to start production in the coming years.

“Many things need to happen in order to meet those timelines and I am happy that this discussion continues at the political level. It’s something that needs continued focus to make it realistic,” Scholtysik said."

1142127072,20231123,"Finland has accused Russia of pushing asylum seekers to its eastern border, which Russia denies.

The European Union’s border protection agency, Frontex, is set to deploy 50 officers to Finland after an increase in asylum seeker arrivals at its eastern border with Russia.

Frontex said on Thursday that in addition to border guard officers and other staff, the agency would send equipment such as patrol cars “to bolster Finland’s border control activities”.

The reinforcement is expected to be on the ground “as soon as next week”, it said in a statement.

Finland on Wednesday said it would shut all but its northernmost border crossing with Russia after it recorded an increase in arrivals of undocumented migrants.

Helsinki said Moscow was to blame, with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo accusing the Russian authorities of “a systematic and organised action” of facilitating the entry of the migrants.

“Undoubtedly Russia is instrumentalising migrants” as part of its “hybrid warfare” against Finland, Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said on Wednesday.

Finland joined NATO in April after decades of military non-alignment and pragmatic friendly relations with Moscow. Its 1,300-kilometre (800-mile) border with Russia serves as the EU’s external border and makes up NATO’s northeastern flank.

Moscow has denied it is funnelling desperate asylum seekers to the Finnish border.

More than 600 asylum seekers have entered Finland via Russia in November, compared with only a few dozen in September and October.

They were mostly from countries including Yemen, Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria, according to border officials. Most were young men in their 20s, but some were families with children, border guard data and photos from news outlets showed.

Stopping short of naming Russia, Frontex head Hans Leijtens said in a statement that the agency was bolstering support to Finland as it was facing “hybrid challenges”.

“This collaboration shows that when facing complex border issues, Europe stands united, offering support through tangible actions,” Leijtens added.

Frontex currently has 10 officers working at the borders of Finland.

In 2021, 3,000 to 4,000 asylum seekers became stranded in a no-man’s land on the border between Poland and Belarus as Warsaw deployed security forces to stop people from entering amid freezing winter temperatures.

Lithuania and Latvia also reported sharp increases in the number of people trying to cross their borders at the time.

The EU and Warsaw said Minsk was deliberately enticing migrants and refugees to Belarus and then pushing them westwards with promises of easy entry into the bloc, and accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of masterminding the crisis."

 The Office for National Statistics revised its estimates for net migration to the UK — meaning the number of people arriving minus those leaving — in the year to December 2022 to 745,000. That is a new record and significantly higher than the previous estimate of 606,000 for the same period.

 The more hard-line wing of the Tories called for Sunak to “act now” as a general election looms next year.

 “The word existential' has been used a lot in recent days but this really is do or die' for our party,” said a statement by a group of lawmakers known as the “New Conservatives.” “Each of us made a promise to the electorate. We don't believe that such promises can be ignored.""

 The Conservatives were reelected in 2019 on the back of a manifesto to “take back our borders"" and break away from the constraints of the European Union. Britain completed its divorce with the trade bloc in 2020.

 Migration continues to be a political hot potato, although Sunak's government has focused less on legal migration than the issue of unauthorised asylum-seekers arriving on small boats across the English Channel.

 The latest figures do show that net migration in the 12 months up to June 2023 was 672,000. The Office for National Statistics said that it was too early to tell if that's the start of a new downward trend.

 Sunak's office at Downing Street said that net migration remained “far too high” and indicated that further measures could be introduced to bring down the figures. Authorities said in May that foreign postgraduate students can no longer bring family members to the UK from next year as part of efforts to curb immigration.

 Officials said they revised the 2022 figures upwards because patterns and behaviors have been shifting and less predictable than before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.

 Jay Lindop, director of the international migration department at the statistics office, said the main drivers of the increase were people arriving from non-EU countries for study and work, particularly in Britain's health and social care sectors.

 Britain also took in hundreds of thousands of people who fled Russia's war in Ukraine and the Chinese government's crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, though those numbers have slowed in recent months.

 “Net migration to the UK has been running at record levels, driven by a rise in people coming for work, increasing numbers of students and a series of world events,"" he said.

 “More recently, we're not only seeing more students arrive, but we can also see they're staying for longer. More dependants of people with work and study visas have arrived too, and immigration is now being driven by non-EU arrivals,"" he added.

 The latest figures showed that a total of 1.18 million people are estimated to have arrived in the UK in the year to June 2023, while 508,000 are estimated to have left, leaving the net migration figure at 672,000. (AP) SCY

Canada has also worked out a deal to build water bombers and ship them to the EU, after both regions faced devastating forest fires this past summer, Trudeau told the crowd at the Quidi Vidi Brewery.

""These are the kinds of things that friends can do when they come together,"" he said, describing Canada and the EU as ""some of the best friends in the world.""

""As we talk about the transatlantic partnership, what better place to dig into it than a rock in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean?"" he added.

This year's EU-Canada Summit in St. John's is the 19th such meeting between Canada's prime minister and the heads of the bloc of 27 countries. The meetings are held every two years, and the last summit took place in Brussels in 2021.

The summit comes as wars rage in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine, and both Trudeau and Michel spoke of the unrest on Thursday. Michel said Canada and the EU have long shared the same values about democracy, dignity and freedom, and the ongoing violence underscored the need for the two countries to work together on issues from peace and security to fighting climate change.

""We are not separated by an ocean, we are connected by this ocean,"" Michel said.

A group of about two dozen pro-Palestinian protesters lined the narrow street outside the building, waving Palestinian flags and chanting ""Ceasefire now!"" Canada has called for ""humanitarian pauses"" in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, though the Liberals have been under sustained pressure from humanitarian organizations, Muslim groups and even some of their MPs to endorse calls for a ceasefire.

Hydrogen energy will also be a big topic of discussion, as Atlantic Canada angles to become a major supplier of hydrogen fuel to European markets, particularly Germany, Trudeau said.

A man at the helm of that effort was among the crowd watching Trudeau's speech. Seafood tycoon John Risley is aiming to build a massive wind-powered hydrogen and ammonia production facility in western Newfoundland with his company, World Energy GH2. He helped bring German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to western Newfoundland last year to sign an agreement with Trudeau to build a hydrogen energy partnership.

Risley said he's looking for the Europeans to ante up. Canada, he said, has come up with programs and loans to back hydrogen developments, including a clean hydrogen investment tax credit. Risley also estimates his company will invest about $250 million into its project before he and his co-directors are ready to make a final investment decision.

He said now it's Europe's turn to make a solid, substantial investment to help move the hydrogen partnership along. Ideally, a country like Germany would announce a program that would help support one of its large industries, like steel production, transition to hydrogen energy, he added.

""Because industry isn't going to make the switch if they don't get some help,"" Risley said.

He said it's ""scary"" to be at the precipice of a new energy industry, waiting for action from slow-moving governments with so much of his own money at stake.

""But on the other hand, it's very exciting because we're standing up a whole new industry that could be huge,"" he said. Atlantic Canada has a ""natural right"" to lead a global transition from fossil fuels to hydrogen, he added.

""We've got the wind,"" Risley said. ""The wind blows more often than the sun shines. So let's take advantage.""

Trudeau is expected to hold formal meetings on Friday with Michel and von der Leyen.

1142133937,20231123,"The shock victory of Geert Wilders's far-right eurosceptic party in Dutch elections sent a political tremor through Brussels, seven months ahead of crucial EU elections.

Despite Wilders's promise to hold a ""Nexit"" referendum, pro-European parties do not yet fear that the Netherlands is going to follow Britain in quitting the European Union.

But his first place finish in a core member of the union is a reminder that populist parties are expected to grow in strength in next year's European Parliament elections.

""The European Union is in danger of death from within and without,"" socialist MEP Raphael Glucksmann said in an interview with the France 2 network, warning that Russia's President Vladimir Putin would be celebrating Wilders's triumph.

""Elections take place at regular intervals in the member states. And this does not, per se, put in doubt in any way the membership of any country to the European Union,"" European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said.

""We continue to count on the Netherlands strong participation in in the European Union, obviously,"" he told reporters.

Wilders's PVV may not be able to build a coalition to make him prime minister so he can join the other 26 EU members at their summits.

And his hardline plans to expel immigrants would be unlikely to survive legal challenges in the Dutch or European courts.

But Europe's support for Ukraine, grand plans to fight climate change and efforts to build a joint strategic position in the face of crises like the Gaza war could be endangered.

European elections to be held in June will be a new test of Wilders's popularity.

With 17 million people, The Netherlands is the seventh most populous EU country and its MEPs -- along with right-wingers from countries like Poland, Italy, France and Hungary -- could form a powerful group.

""We can expect at least a consolidation of right-wing populists, even an increase in their number of seats in the European Parliament, said Nathalie Brack of Brussels Free University.

The PVV does not have any seats in the current parliament, but next year they could join the National Rally (RN) of France's Marine Le Pen and Germany's AFD in the assembly's Identity and Democracy group.

That is what the European far-right hopes for.

""Bring on June 2024!"" exclaimed French RN MEP Jordan Bardella, in a social media post hailing Wilders's win as a ""beautiful defeat"" for supporters of immigration and Islamism.

The larger ECR group of eurosceptic parties, currently dominated by Poland's PiS and Spain's Vox, could also benefit from a populist surge, the political scientist Brack told AFP.

The ECR already has 67 seats and could pass the Greens, currently on 72, thanks to what she called ""a generalised discontent"" with traditional centre parties.

""There is even the chance that ECR becomes the third group in parliament if, for example, the liberals are punished at the polls,"" she said.

Traditionally, European legislation moves forward backed by a broad coalition of the pro-European centre right and centre left.

If such groups did not have a working majority, law-making could grind to a halt and the most ambitious plans of supporters of the ""ever closer union"" would be halted or reversed.

Far-right gains are not the European centre's only worry, however. The Netherlands' elections were a setback for one of its champions: Dutch social democrat leader Frans Timmermans.

Until recently a vice-president of the European Commission and architect of the the EU's plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, Timmermans returned home to lead a left-green coalition in the Dutch campaign.

Now, with his group coming in behind the far-right, he is in a weak position to negotiate a role in the next governing coalition."
1142133944,20231123,"ATALANTA, FIRST NAVAL OPERATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, CELEBRATES ITS 15TH ANNIVERSARY

The European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR) Operation ATALANTA, whose Headquarters is in Spain, provides maritime security in the North-West Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. EUNAVFOR ATALANTA plays a vital role in the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy and in the EU's naval diplomacy for the Indo-Pacific. The event took place in conjunction with the Operation Commander's handover ceremony.

Rota, 23 November 2023 - Operation ATALANTA celebrated the 15th anniversary of its inception with a ceremony at the Rota Naval Base. The event took place in conjunction with the handover ceremony of command from the current Commander, Vice Admiral José María Núñez Torrente, to the new Commander, Vice Admiral Ignacio Villanueva Serrano.

During the anniversary celebration event, well-deserved recognition was given to all participating countries, as well as to the troops and other personnel involved in the Operation. ""We celebrate the example of what the EU can achieve, with an international, synergetic and committed effort of all its Member States, in cooperation with its partners,"" said Vice Admiral José María Núñez Torrente. His words were followed by a video summary of the work carried out by the Operation over the years.

The handover ceremony of the Operation Commander was presided over by the Spanish Chief of Defence Staff (JEMAD), Admiral General Teodoro Esteban López Calderón on behalf of the Chairman of the European Union Military Committee, General Robert Brieger. After the handover ceremony, the new Commander, Vice Admiral Villanueva stressed ""My challenge will be to command the transformation of ATALANTA while keeping it operationally realistic, operationally effective and operationally adaptable to the new maritime security challenges, and all this under the guidance and strategic direction of the EU Political and Security Committee"".

The European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR) Operation ATALANTA, whose Headquarter has been based in Spain since 29 March 2019, plays a crucial role in protecting maritime traffic and maintaining stability in the North-West Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. Since its inception in 2008, the operation has been an example of international cooperation, involving a total of 20 EU and non-EU countries.

It was at the end of 2008 that the Council of the European Union adopted Resolution 2008/851/CFSP, based on various UN resolutions, to establish the EU maritime military operation - Operation ATALANTA and contribute to the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy off the coast of Somalia. Over time, EUNAVFOR's mandate has been adapted to reflect the evolving situation in the region and the increased presence of the international community, with the aim of developing the Operation into a provider of maritime security in the North-West Indian Ocean while maintaining the focus on counter-piracy.

During these 15 years, ATALANTA has faced various challenges, constantly adapting to the evolving threats in the region. Throughout this time, Operation ATALANTA has protected more than 2000 World Food Programme vessels with a total of 3,200,000 tonnes of food and other aid distributed. In addition, 16 tonnes of narcotics have been seized and significant progress has been made against piracy in the area of operations. The operation has been an effective tool of naval diplomacy and has underlined the importance of international collaboration and the need to maintain an effective presence to prevent and combat illegal activities in the area of responsibility.

Among the military and civil authorities attending were the Spanish Chief of Defense Staff (CHOD), Admiral General Teodoro Esteban López Calderón; the Admiral of the Fleet, Admiral Eugenio Díaz del Río Jáudenes and the Chief of Staff of the Operations Command (JEMMOPS), Vice Admiral Íñigo de la Puente Mora-Figueroa."
1142136180,20231123,"Alicante is amongst the locations that will benefit from the integration of European Union funded underwater drones operated by the Guardia Civil.

The Guardia Civil showed off the ten GLADIUS MINI S model underwater drones with 4K UHD camera in the Port of Valencia, who will also have a drone stationed there, operated by the various Fiscal and Border Units, which will also include Barcelona, ​​Bilbao, Malaga, Vigo, Algeciras, Puerto de la Luz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and Santander.

The acquisition of this new equipment aims to reinforce the capacity of the Guardia Civil in the prevention and prosecution of smuggling of all types of illicit products, in a context increasingly characterised by the improvement of the concealment techniques that criminal organisations are attacking boats that arrive at the ports of the European Union, taking advantage of the different hidden holes they have, both above and below the water line.

The Guardia Civil thus increases its inspection capabilities in this type of environment, thus reinforcing the security of our external borders against all types of threats and particularly against smuggling.

The new underwater drones will allow a greater number of inspections to be carried out on the hulls of ships, thus complementing the function carried out by the Fiscal and Border Analysis and Investigation Units of the Guardia Civil (UDAIFF), in charge of carrying out risk analyses at the border that will allow said equipment to be deployed where necessary, and that of the GEAS (divers), Special Group for Underwater Activities, which would act when the need arises after the use of drones.

Likewise, these drones aim to increase port and maritime traffic protection with security-oriented reconnaissance.

The acquisition of this equipment has been paid for mostly by the European Union, with 80% within the framework of the EUAF 2021 aid program (Union Anti-Fraud Programme) of the OLAF of the European Union and the remaining 20% ​​by the Guardia Civil."

“We have begun collecting data for the evacuation of our drivers ... we will evacuate everyone who expresses such a desire,” Derkach wrote on Facebook on Thursday, posting a link to the evacuation request form.

Drivers are asked to agree to be evacuated to Ukraine without a vehicle, as follows from its text.

“We have raised the issue several times at the working and official levels regarding food, the duty of ambulances, fire trucks, proper sanitary conditions - all this does not exist. But in the future we see messages about the approval of the continuation of the protest by local authorities,” the deputy minister emphasized.

He also said that over the past three weeks the issue of lifting the blockade had been raised “at all possible levels:”dozens of letters were written and meetings were held.

“We have proposed a number of compromises, the Polish government and the European Commission know them. But it is possible to agree on something when there is a desire to negotiate, and not just a desire to block the border,” Derkach wrote.

According to him, the Ministry of Reconstruction also sent an official letter with a proposal to create a monitoring group on the part of the European Union at the border. Its tasks should include recording the situation at blocked checkpoints: whether dangerous goods are allowed through, how humanitarian aid crosses the border, and what conditions Ukrainian drivers are in.

As reported, the blockade of three checkpoints on the Ukrainian-Polish border on Thursday extended to the fourth, Shehyni-Medyka. The State Customs Service warned that the number of blocked checkpoints on the Polish border could increase to five: protesters could block the Nizhankovychi-Malchowice checkpoint.

Leader of the Polish carriers blocking the border, Rafal Meckler of the far-right National Movement, said on Thursday that among the conditions for lifting the blockade is a return to the system of issuing permits for Ukrainian cargo carriers in the European Union, which will not apply to humanitarian and military assistance, as well as the creation of separate corridors and “live” Queues for empty cars with EU license plates to leave at checkpoints.

“We get it on paper and at the same moment we leave the border. The ball is in Ukraine’s court,” Meckler wrote."

London: King Charles III bade farewell to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday, ending a trip that saw Britain roll out the red carpet to help the two countries forge closer links.

Yoon, who made the visit with First Lady Kim Keon Hee, bowed to the monarch as the couple left Buckingham Palace, at the end of the three-day state visit, the first since Charles was crowned in May.

The king said ""hope the dogs are ok"" as he said goodbye to Kim. She and her husband reportedly have six pet dogs, as well as five cats.

Charles threw a lavish state banquet at the palace -- attended by UK royals and K-pop stars Blackpink -- on Tuesday as the South Korean leader received a grand welcome.

Earlier, the South Korean leader enjoyed a private lunch at the palace and visited Westminster Abbey, where Charles was formally crowned monarch six months ago.

Yoon also held talks with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday as well as opposition leader Keir Starmer, who is tipped to become Britain's next leader at an election expected in 2024.

Yoon and Sunak committed to deepening ties, signing a new diplomatic accord that ""deepens our long-standing relationship"" and steps up ""cooperation on technology, defence and security,"" according to the UK prime minister's office.

The two leaders also agreed to start negotiations on a new UK-South Korea free trade deal.

 

 An existing accord replicates the European Union's agreement with South Korea, and London is eager to showcase the benefits of having left the bloc by striking FTAs with Indo-Pacific nations.

UK Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch launched the talks with her South Korean counterpart at a business forum which took place Wednesday alongside the state visit.

Total trade in goods and services between the UK and South Korea was worth £16.1 billion ($20.1 billion) in the year to the end of June.

Yoon addressed lawmakers from both chambers of Britain's parliament on Tuesday, telling them that bilateral relations between the two countries ""will be reborn as true global strategic partners""."

1142154388,20231123,"(Bloomberg) -- When far-right leader Geert Wilders delivered his victory speech after the shock Dutch election result, he emphasized a willingness to compromise with other parties.
• None Everything You Need to Know About China’s Child Pneumonia Outbreak
• None ‘Fear Gauge’ Hits 2020 Low as Stocks Up This Week: Markets Wrap
• None Sandy Hook Families Offer Alex Jones Two Ways Out of Bankruptcy

But his campaign had hit on all the familiar themes of his long crusade against the migrants that he says are destroying his country’s culture. People don’t forget those kind of diatribes, and many voters who backed other parties are worried that the Netherlands is about to lurch into the kind of populist politics that characterized Donald Trump’s presidency in the US.

Just like Trump, Wilders cultivates an eye-catching splash of hair and, in the final days of the campaign, he had taken to wearing red ties rather than his usual blue, as if to emphasize the visual similarities. As he soaked up the attention in the aftermath of his victory, he was happy to entertain the comparison.

“People have come up with so many names for me,” he told reporters on Thursday. “Some say I am the Dutch Trump, others call me Geert Milders” — a jibe that suggests his views have suddenly and conveniently become more mild since he began trying to form a coalition.

“The truth is somewhere in the middle,” he suggested.

Wilders appeared to be signaling to potential partners that he had indeed softened his views. But perhaps what has really changed over the last 20 years is less the Freedom Party leader than the country around him.

Excluding immigrants from the European Union’s fifth-largest economy has been a career defining passion for the 60-year-old who is now longest serving lawmaker in the Dutch parliament.

He began his career in the liberal VVD which became the natural party of government during Mark Rutte’s 13 years in power. Wilders split from the VVD to strike out on his own in the early 2000s — before Trump had even started hosting the Celebrity Apprentice.

In the early 2000s he was banned from traveling to the UK under a law designed to exclude extremists - although that restriction was successfully overturned in one of so many encounters with the authorities. He’s also been censured for insulting Moroccans, acquitted of inciting hatred and suspended from Twitter, as it was then known, for attacking Islam.

The late success of his political career nevertheless owes something to the man who’s battling to return to the White House next year. Both present themselves as the fighting for the ordinary people and railing against the elites.

“Trump came after him, but Trump must have been an inspiration and a catalyst,” said Stefan Couperus, an associate professor of political science at Groningen University. “Trump has normalized the politics of bad manners, and Wilders does that as well.”

Wilders had articulated his political strategy back in 2003 — in a conversation with the then-future prime minister, Rutte. His idea, he said, was “to know which topics you want to claim.”

Since then he has broadened his repertoire, tapping into worries about the welfare state, healthcare and affordable housing to appeal to more voters.

But when Rutte’s fourth and final coalition collapsed this year due to a dispute about immigration, Wilders was positioned to capitalize. Other parties hardened their line in an effort to compete, but Wilders has spent a career making that territory his own.

“When it comes to immigration, it is logical that voters go for ‘the original’ and not for the copy,” Sarah de Lange, Professor of Political Pluralism at University of Amsterdam said on X.

And now he faces the complex task of recruiting the allies he needs to form a government and consolidate that victory.

The Freedom Party’s 37 seats give Wilders a larger lead over the other parties than any poll was predicting. But he still needs allies — 15 parties ended up represented in parliament, and he cannot govern without coming to an agreement with at least some of them.

As he begins that task, Couperus says, observers shouldn’t be expecting any of the chaotic exploits that have sometimes undermined Trump.

“Wilders is way smarter” than Trump, Couperus said. “Trump causes a lot of collateral damage and that won’t happen to Wilders.”

The two officials discussed the general situation in the country, the ongoing floods, and EU development projects.

They also tackled ways in which the EU can contribute to the progress of the activities of the Senate.

Speaker Hashi thanked Johansson for the unwavering commitment and support by the EU for the Horn of Africa Nation in different facets including State building processes, development projects it is implementing across the country and other essential help it is rendering to the Somali government.

Johansson, on her part, underscored the EU’s undertaking to continue supporting Somalia in various fronts.

The EU and Somalia have established good working relations spanning a long time.

The EU supports Somalia in the security, Economic and development sectors, provides training to government officials, and is also involved in institutional reforms.

1142159104,20231123,"The medium and small enterprises are getting greater importance in the new free trade agreements (FTAs) that India is negotiating, a senior official said on Thursday.

Through these deals, efforts are being made to address the handicaps the sector faces such as information gaps, onerous procedural requirements and lack of capacity to benefit from the deals, additional secretary, department of commerce, Rajesh Agarwal said at an industry event.

“Every FTA India has entered into mentions the MSME sector, even if only in passing. Now we are making a complete chapter on MSMEs. As a country, we will have to start putting in more and more weight around the work MSMEs can do and how they can be enabled to leverage the FTAs.”

FTAs can bring advantages to MSMEs as by evening out tariffs it enables them to become part of global value chains. In the FTAs being negotiated, there is a lot of talk about addressing the information asymmetries MSMEs face in trade through sharing of best practices and other trade enabling knowledge.

In the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework of Prosperity (IPEF), a provision has been made where the US will take in 500 entrepreneurs and workers from member countries for six months to two years for on-the-job training and capacity building.

Another handicap MSMEs face is procedures and paperwork involved that might require physical presence of exporters or their representatives. “All FTAs are talking about digitisation of processes, e-documentation, e-billing… and logistics involved in exports,” Agarwal said.

He said recently a pilot was done to send a consignment to Florida through Singapore through e-bills. “We are increasingly moving towards that and FTAs make provision around it,” he added.

MSMEs that account for 50% of the exports now are also being positioned by the government as providers of niche products for which customers in the developed countries are willing to pay more.

“As the full potential of cross border e-commerce takes off it will unlock a lot more opportunities for MSMEs,” Agarwal said.

At present India is negotiating six FTAs including some with key trade partners like the European Union, UK and Australia. “In all these FTAs we are looking for tariff concessions which will drive jobs and MSMEs,” Agarwal added.

While FTAs bring market opportunities they also impose tougher standards on climate and labour which will also require effort and costs to comply with."

The United States has proposed that the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority should ultimately govern Gaza and floated the idea that some international coalition — presumably including Arab states — provide security in the interim. Arab leaders have demanded an immediate end to the fighting without addressing the governance question, and they have rejected any security role in the territory.

And Israel, while reluctant to occupy Gaza as it did before 2005, has suggested it would maintain a security role there for some indefinite period.

U.S. President Joe Biden laid out his vision for the future of Gaza and of Israel-Palestinian relations in a November 18 commentary in The Washington Post, arguing that the Palestinian people “deserve a state of their own and a future free from Hamas.”

“Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure, ultimately under a revitalized Palestinian Authority, as we all work toward a two-state solution,” Biden wrote.

In the meantime, he continued, “The international community must commit resources to support the people of Gaza in the immediate aftermath of this crisis, including interim security measures, and establish a reconstruction mechanism to sustainably meet Gaza’s long-term needs.”

Arab and Muslim leaders, represented by a ministerial delegation that is touring the five permanent U.N. Security Council states, are calling for an immediate end to the fighting and the delivery of humanitarian aid to the residents of Gaza but have had little to say about long-term governance of the territory.

While agreeing with Biden on the need to establish a Palestinian state, participation in an interim security force for Gaza has been soundly rejected by some countries in the delegation — made up of Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Nigeria, the Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

""Let me be very clear,” said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi at the Manama Dialogue, a November 18 security conference sponsored by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

“I know speaking on behalf of Jordan but having discussed this issue with many, with almost all our brethren, there'll be no Arab troops going to Gaza. None. We're not going to be seen as the enemy,"" he said.

As for the long-term governance of the territory, Safadi asked, ""How could anybody talk about the future of Gaza when we do not know what kind of Gaza will be left once this aggression ends?""

Israel, for its part, has acknowledged that it began its military drive to end Hamas’ rule in Gaza without a clear plan for what would replace it.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ABC News earlier this month, however, that he thought Israel would assume “overall security responsibility” for Gaza after the war for an “indefinite period.”

The Arab and Muslim leaders, wary of Netanyahu’s far-right coalition in Israel, doubt the willingness of the United States and its allies to bring sufficient pressure on Israel to see an end to the war and the beginning of serious talks on a two-state solution, according to Elham Fakhro, an associate fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House.

“Arab states perceive a lack of commitment from the United States and the European Union in pressuring Israel to implement these measures,” Fakhro told VOA.

“Consequently, they are turning to alternative diplomatic channels, including engagement with China, to convey their concerns. The hope is that international pressure can sway the U.S. and, subsequently, influence Israel to reconsider its current course of action.”

While the humanitarian crisis in Gaza weighs heavily on the Arab leaders, that is not their only concern, Fakhro added. She said they also fear the potential for the conflict to spill over into the broader region, causing widespread instability.

Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told VOA that most Arab governments view the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank as dysfunctional, which increases their reluctance to play a direct role in taking charge of Gaza after the war."

Zimbabwe has so far exported over 210 million kg of tobacco worth over US$1 billion, more than two thirds of the crop, since the start of the marketing season, giving merchants and farmers hope that the target of US$1,6 billion exports can be easily met.

This was a major increase from US$900 million realised in the 2022 season.

While farmers deliver and sell their tobacco in a short season, and they delivered almost 300 million kg this year, the merchants do the initial processing, sorting and exporting over a full year.

About US$1 099 773 198 million has so far been achieved from exporting tobacco compared to US$766 646 001 million sold in the same period last year, an increase of over 20 percent.

This year, nearly 300 million kg of tobacco was produced, the highest ever in the history of Zimbabwe, prompting the Government to set a target of US$1,6 billion exports.

Statistics from the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board indicate that with about 99 million kg of tobacco worth US$706m at an average price of US$7,16/kg the Far East remains the largest single market with the average price showing that it takes the largest share of the best quality leaf.

About 38 million kg valued at US$130 million was exported in Africa at an average price of US$3,45/kg.

Nearly 34 million kg of tobacco valued at US$148 million was exported to the European Union at an average price of US$4,34/kg. Another 28 million kg worth US$73 million went to the Middle East at an average price of US$2,57/kg.

About six million kg valued at US$24 million was sold to Europe outside the EU at an average price of US$4,02/kg, and over five million kg was sold to the Americas for US$19 million at an average price of US$3,85/kg.

Export of tobacco products has been on an upward trend, with earnings of US$795 million in 2020, US$837 million in 2021 and US$998 million last year.

The regular rise in the crop, with new production and value records set each year, reflect the growing number of small-scale farmers who now carry the burden of the crop bringing a lot of prosperity to the “tobacco belt” across natural region two.

The growth in exports shows that world markets can continue absorbing more Zimbabwean tobacco with its reputation for quality.

Although value is added by the merchants with their initial processing, grading, sorting and making up of orders, the thrust is now on boosting manufactured products to reach a US$5 billion tobacco industry by 2025.

Zimbabwe Farmers Union secretary general Mr Paul Zakariya said farmers have worked hard and the effort is commendable adding that the increase in export earnings was a welcome development and growers must be applauded for that.

“The vision for a US$5 billion tobacco industry is quite achievable. As we inch towards that vision, we need to significantly increase local funding for tobacco production. This will allow for local value addition and import substitution of finished products. That is where real value is,” he said.

Tobacco Farmers Union Trust president Mr Victor Mariranyika said tobacco is the biggest foreign currency earning crop which needs a practical action approach when growing it adding that it is critical to empower small holder farmers.

‘’Contracting companies should provide enough inputs and on time to ensure that best results are achieved. Several small holder farmers’ lives have totally positively changed, and production costs should not rise to ensure that farmers get a profit. Over the past two seasons there has been a significant increase in cost of production.

Tobacco Farmers Union Trust vice president Mr Edward Dune said this year’s exports signifies the critical work done by farmers adding that more should be done by the Government to empower small holder farmers so that they will not depend on contracting companies.

“If Government continues to empower small holder farmers like in the case of Pfumvudza, then farmers are assured of getting inputs on time.

“Unscrupulous middlemen should totally be eliminated to ensure that farmers get what they actually deserve.

“Tobacco has transformed the majority of people but there is a need to ensure that processing is done in the country to ensure that our farmers get more money,”he said.

In a recent interview Mrs Marjorie Makwiza of Banket said of all the crops, tobacco has positively transformed her life and her children.

“Since l started growing tobacco, everything almost changed. It was difficult to send my children to school or even to feed them but now l can testify that everything is now moving smoothly. I earn large amounts of money every year. So far no challenges I am facing. Every year l grow more than 20 bales. To me tobacco has transformed my life and next year l am planning to increase the hectarage because of 85 percent foreign currency retention which was introduced by the Government. This is a motivating initiative,” she said.

Mr Tawanda Marembo of Raffingora also mentioned that all his wealth emanated from growing tobacco.

“I started growing tobacco in 2018 but l can tell you that l bought a car, tractor and l built a nice house in Chinhoyi. Tobacco pays if good agronomic practises are implemented. This crop has transformed my life and l pledge to continue growing tobacco. Other crops are paying but tobacco has proved to be the biggest paying crop,” he said."

The Guardia Civil showed off the ten GLADIUS MINI S model underwater drones with 4K UHD camera in the Port of Valencia, who will also have a drone stationed there, operated by the various Fiscal and Border Units, which will also include Barcelona, ​​Bilbao, Malaga, Vigo, Algeciras, Puerto de la Luz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and Santander.

The acquisition of this new equipment aims to reinforce the capacity of the Guardia Civil in the prevention and prosecution of smuggling of all types of illicit products, in a context increasingly characterised by the improvement of the concealment techniques that criminal organisations are attacking boats that arrive at the ports of the European Union, taking advantage of the different hidden holes they have, both above and below the water line.

The Guardia Civil thus increases its inspection capabilities in this type of environment, thus reinforcing the security of our external borders against all types of threats and particularly against smuggling.

The new underwater drones will allow a greater number of inspections to be carried out on the hulls of ships, thus complementing the function carried out by the Fiscal and Border Analysis and Investigation Units of the Guardia Civil (UDAIFF), in charge of carrying out risk analyses at the border that will allow said equipment to be deployed where necessary, and that of the GEAS (divers), Special Group for Underwater Activities, which would act when the need arises after the use of drones.

Likewise, these drones aim to increase port and maritime traffic protection with security-oriented reconnaissance.

The acquisition of this equipment has been paid for mostly by the European Union, with 80% within the framework of the EUAF 2021 aid program (Union Anti-Fraud Programme) of the OLAF of the European Union and the remaining 20% ​​by the Guardia Civil.

The Finnish government decided to close a number of its borders due to the flood of migrants coming from Russia.

HELSINKI, THURSDAY — Finland has decided to close some of its border gates with Russia to prevent the entry of undocumented immigrants coming from Russian territory. This action has been regretted by Moscow.

Several border authority officers in Finland are escorting a group of migrants trying to enter the country at the Salla crossing point, on Thursday (23/11/2023).

The following article was translated using both Microsoft Azure Open AI and Google Translation AI. The original article can be found in Kebanjiran Migran, Finlandia Tutup Perbatasan dengan Rusia

The decision was announced by the Finnish Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, on Wednesday (22/11/2023) evening local time. He stated that the closure of four border crossing points directly adjacent to Russia last week did not prevent hundreds of undocumented immigrants from the Russian territory from crossing into Finland.

He stated that the government has decided to close three more crossings, namely Vartius, Kuusamo, and Salla. Therefore, there is only one crossing that is open, namely Raja-Joseppi in the Arctic region, the northernmost crossing point between the two countries, approximately 1100 kilometers north of Helsinki.

After the decision was announced, border guards and Finnish soldiers began installing barriers, including concrete barriers lined with barbed wire at the closed crossing point.

""We need to do this to maintain order (at the intersection) and ensure the safety of legitimate border traffic,"" said Tomi Tirkkonen, Deputy Commander of the Kainuu Border Guard District in Eastern Finland, to The Associated Press.

The closure is not unrelated to the entry of about 600 undocumented immigrants without adequate visas and documentation. Most of them are migrants from the Middle East and Africa. In September and October, a number of immigrants from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Kenya, Morocco, and Somalia, according to border officials, have also arrived in Finland from Russia.

According to data, approximately 30-70 migrants arrive in the Finnish region every day through the Vartius checkpoint in Kainuu and the Salla checkpoint in Lapland Arctic Finland. In both of these checkpoints, the temperature drops to minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).

On Wednesday (22/11/2023), Andrei Chibis, the governor of the northern Murmansk region in Russia bordering Finland, uploaded a photo of migrants in a tent near the Salla checkpoint established by local authorities. They are able to warm themselves, eat, and drink hot tea.

Chibis describes this situation as a humanitarian crisis and condemns the Finnish authorities, stating that foreign nationals are unable to cross the border into Finnish territory.

Most of the migrants are young men in their 20s and 30s. However, some of them are families with children and women.

The number of migrants attempting to cross into Finland is very high. The right-wing government of Orpo has accused Moscow of deliberately bringing migrants to the Russian-Finnish border zone, which is usually under the strict control of the Russian Federal Security Service or FSB.

""There is no doubt that Russia is exploiting migrants as part of the 'hybrid war' against Finland,"" said Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen.

Valtonen stated that they have evidence that Russian authorities allowed migrants to enter the Finnish border and even actively helped them enter the border zone. Although there is an agreement that migrants can cross by car, the latest phenomenon is that they are walking to reach the border.

Spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Maria Zakharova stated that Russian authorities are ready to collaborate with Finnish officials to reach an agreement regarding border issues. She believes that Finland should voice their concerns in order to find a mutually acceptable solution or accept an explanation.

Due to the decision to close the border with Russia, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the Finnish Ambassador in Moscow to submit an official protest.

The issue of migrant entry into European countries has been a problem for several years, especially in countries with geographical proximity or those deemed to have direct access to conflict areas. Many asylum seekers are now in Turkey or Greece, which are considered easily accessible.

Niinisto calls for a solution across the entire European Union to prevent uncontrolled entry of people into the Schengen area, which is a passport-free zone in Europe.

The European Union border agency, Frontex, plans to deploy personnel and equipment to Finland as early as next week in response to Helsinki's request to help control the influx of migrants. EU migration commissioner Ylva Johansson, on Tuesday (11/21/2023), said that Finland has requested 60 Frontex personnel, in addition to the 10 personnel already stationed along its 1,340 kilometer border with Russia.

Not only Finland feels that Russia is trying to bring migrants to Europe, but the Estonian government also accused Russia of actively bringing migrants to its borders on Wednesday. Last week, 75 migrants, predominantly from Somalia and Syria, entered Estonia through Russia.

The Estonian government has declared that they will close the border crossing if migration pressure from Russia increases and will take action if they attempt to enter outside of official crossing points. (AP/REUTERS)"

Not just at Westminster. But in society at large.

Conflicts and contradictions, wherever you look and listen.

There are the numbers. There is the economics. There are the practicalities.

There are industries, there is the health service, and there are some parts of the UK keen to lure people in.

But this is a debate about emotion, sentiment, belonging, identity - and sometimes fear too: some communities rapidly altered; public services strained.
• None Legal migration is too high, says Rishi Sunak

It has been a conversation that has been a near constant soundtrack to the Conservatives' 13 years in office so far, since 2010.

When the now Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron was prime minister, he promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands.

It is a pledge that has never come close to being met and became a motivating factor for some to back Brexit.

And yet net migration has soared since.

And that contributes to a ripple effect into other equally fraught political themes - such as planning, the demands for more housing.

The reaction of our political parties to these numbers is worth unpicking.

The Scottish National Party lashed out at what it sees as Westminster's obsession with driving the numbers down.

The SNP says Scotland needs more immigration of people of working age, not less - to help public services function and the private sector to thrive.

Compare that to the language of the Conservatives and Labour - and what comes across as an attempt to out do each other in their anger.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the figure was ""shockingly high"".

The prime minister's official spokesman said it was ""far too high"".

Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman claimed the numbers were ""unsustainable"" and ""a slap on the face to the British public"".

And yet at the heart of all of this is an essential truth.

The responsibility for immigration policy, from anywhere, lies at Westminster.

The vote for Brexit may have been two general elections ago, in 2016, but the next election will be the first fought with the UK no longer a member of the European Union.

As a member of the EU, there was free movement of people around the club, including to and from the UK.

It meant politicians could, and did, blame it for not being fully in control of immigration.

But come the general election campaign, each party, for the first time, will have to set out its approach to immigration knowing where the buck now stops.

Each will have to articulate their instinct and attitude and their policies.

Each will know that if they form a government, the six monthly numbers published by the Office for National Statistics will be for them solely to justify, to defend.

They can no longer blame anyone else."

The United States has proposed that the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority should ultimately govern Gaza and floated the idea that some international coalition — presumably including Arab states — provide security in the interim. Arab leaders have demanded an immediate end to the fighting without addressing the governance question, and they have rejected any security role in the territory.

And Israel, while reluctant to occupy Gaza as it did before 2005, has suggested it would maintain a security role there for some indefinite period.

“Arab governments have demanded that a two-state solution be implemented that recognizes the 1948 borders of Israel. They insist that the Palestinians must have self-determination and sovereignty,” he said.

“This is something that the present Israeli government has refused, which creates an impasse.”"

1142205621,20231124,"We celebrated a significant milestone this Veterans Day: 100 years since the end of World War I.

But another noteworthy anniversary fell on that day. Nov. 11, 2018, also marked the centennial of a free Poland, one of America’s most important allies in Europe.

It’s been a rough journey, though. The road since that historic day in 1918 has been pockmarked with strife.

Being situated between Germany and Russia is the global equivalent of drawing the short straw. World War II officially began on Sept. 1, 1939, when Hitler’s army invaded Poland from the west. Only 17 days later, the Soviets rolled in from the east.

Thanks to the post-war Warsaw Pact, Poland wound up in the Soviet bloc of states, its people ruled by communists who did Moscow’s bidding.

But this state of affairs was not destined to last forever. The determined and courageous efforts of certain key leaders — from President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to Pope John Paul II (the first Polish pontiff) and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa — effected a remarkable transformation in the 1980s. Together, they and the freedom-loving people of Poland rewrote history. Their country today is a NATO member and a loyal friend of the United States.

I was back in Poland just (some weeks) before its recent round of elections in October and met with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Once again, I was struck with what a vibrant democracy it is.

It also features an open and growing economy — the European Union’s sixth-largest, in fact, thanks in part to a strong manufacturing sector. Poland ranks 45th out of 180 countries in the latest “Index of Economic Freedom.” Sure, it has a couple of weak spots, but considering how long the country suffered under communist rule, that’s really a remarkable accomplishment.

Poland’s strong institutions, the Index editors note, enabled it to become the only European country to record economic growth during the 2009 credit crisis.

More importantly for the United States, Poland is key to a safe Europe. It is a vital bulwark against Moscow’s geopolitical designs. As historian Lee Edwards has pointed out:

“As the next-door neighbor of Ukraine and with uncertainty about Russia’s next aggressive move, Poland matters. Adjoining as it does the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — all prime targets of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s imperialist design — Poland matters. As the largest, most prosperous, and most entrepreneurial member of the old Warsaw Pact, Poland matters.”

Poland certainly does matter, which is why Americans should be grateful that relations between our nations remains strong. Georgette Mosbacher, the U.S. ambassador to Poland, and Piotr Wilczek, Poland’s ambassador to the U.S., just penned a joint op-ed to praise what they called “a high point in bilateral relations.”

This was reinforced in September when President Trump and President Andrzej Duda signed a “Declaration on Polish-American Strategic Partnership.” According to the two ambassadors, it “emphasizes the strong ties and common interests between our countries in the areas of security and defense, energy, trade and investment, research and innovation.”

As Lech Walesa once said, “I am happy that Poland is returning to the road of pluralism and democracy.” Working together with our Polish allies, let’s make sure that, over the next 100 years, its star continues to rise."

Frontex said on Thursday that in addition to border guard officers and other staff, the agency would send equipment such as patrol cars “to bolster Finland’s border control activities”.

The reinforcement is expected to be on the ground “as soon as next week”, it said in a statement.

Finland on Wednesday said it would shut all but its northernmost border crossing with Russia after it recorded an increase in arrivals of undocumented migrants.

Helsinki said Moscow was to blame, with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo accusing the Russian authorities of “a systematic and organised action” of facilitating the entry of the migrants.

“Undoubtedly Russia is instrumentalising migrants” as part of its “hybrid warfare” against Finland, Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said on Wednesday.

Finland joined NATO in April after decades of military non-alignment and pragmatic friendly relations with Moscow. Its 1,300-kilometre (800-mile) border with Russia serves as the EU’s external border and makes up NATO’s northeastern flank.

Moscow has denied it is funnelling desperate asylum seekers to the Finnish border.

More than 600 asylum seekers have entered Finland via Russia in November, compared with only a few dozen in September and October.

They were mostly from countries including Yemen, Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria, according to border officials. Most were young men in their 20s, but some were families with children, border guard data and photos from news outlets showed.

Stopping short of naming Russia, Frontex head Hans Leijtens said in a statement that the agency was bolstering support to Finland as it was facing “hybrid challenges”.

“This collaboration shows that when facing complex border issues, Europe stands united, offering support through tangible actions,” Leijtens added.

Frontex currently has 10 officers working at the borders of Finland.

In 2021, 3,000 to 4,000 asylum seekers became stranded in a no-man’s land on the border between Poland and Belarus as Warsaw deployed security forces to stop people from entering amid freezing winter temperatures.

Lithuania and Latvia also reported sharp increases in the number of people trying to cross their borders at the time.

The EU and Warsaw said Minsk was deliberately enticing migrants and refugees to Belarus and then pushing them westwards with promises of easy entry into the bloc, and accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of masterminding the crisis."

Renamo, on Wednesday accused Foreign Minister Veronica Macamo of a conflict of interests, when she scheduled a meeting with heads of diplomatic missions accredited in Maputo to brief them on the municipal elections held on 11 October.

At a press conference at the Renamo headquarters, the party's head of foreign relations, Manuel Massingue, pointed out that Macamo is not only Foreign Minister, but also a member of the Political Commission of the ruling Frelimo Party, and the Frelimo national election agent.

This means that her meeting with senior foreign diplomats was ""inopportune and anti-ethical', said Massingue, cited by the independent television station STV.

He believed that, given Macamo's responsibilities in the Frelimo election machinery, the meeting ""is a real conflict of interests'.

He accused Frelimo of ""manipulating' the elections, and noted that Macamo had publicly boasted that her party had ""worked hard' to win them.

""So it is pertinent to ask in what capacity she is inviting the heads of mission and representatives of international organisations, knowing that the Frelimo of which she is a part is a candidate that is doing everything it can to manipulate the truth of the elections and public opinion', stressed Massingue.

Renamo also believed that the meeting was an attempt to intimidate diplomats so that they would say nothing about the irregularities that had characterized the elections.

Massingue appealed to the diplomats ""not to associate themselves with any attempt to corrupt the electoral truth expressed by the Mozambican people at the ballot box'.

STV asked the Foreign Ministry whether such a meeting between the Minister and the diplomats had indeed been scheduled. The Ministry refused to confirm or deny it - which was foolish, since the invitation to the meeting had already circulated widely on social media.

The meeting went ahead on Wednesday, and the Ministry then issued a singularly uninformative ""Declaration to the Press'. This said that Macamo's meeting with the chiefs of mission was part of her ""regular interaction' with the diplomatic corps, and that such meetings have been the ""unchanging and lasting method which the Mozambican government has adopted to communicate with the international community about matters concerning the political, economic and social development of Mozambique'.

Macamo spoke of Mozambique's election to one of the non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council, and of ""the regular political dialogue' between Mozambique and the European Union.

But she said very little about the municipal elections, and the accusations by opposition parties, and by much of civil society, that the preliminary results announced by the National Elections Commission (CNE) are fraudulent.

Instead, she claimed that all phases of the elections ""took place in accordance with the norms and principles of the Mozambican rule of law, enshrined in the Mozambican constitution'.

She stressed the ""massive participation' of the voters on polling day - although in reality turnout was about 55 per cent. This is much higher than local elections in many other countries, but much lower than turnout in Mozambique's early multi-party elections in the 1990s.

Macamo said that the political parties are now waiting for the Constitutional Council, Mozambique's highest body in matters of constitutional and electoral law, to deliver its verdict. The government hoped that this waiting period would be one of ""peace, calm and responsibility'.

She told the diplomats, according to the Declaration, ""we are confident that this process, like the previous ones, will end well, because Mozambicans know what they want. They want peace and the development of the country'.

Maputo, 23 Nov (AIM) - The Mozambican government and the European Union on Wednesday signed financing agreements for five projects in the areas of energy, digitalization, the blue economy and technical and professional training.

Each project, according to a report in the independent daily ""O Pais', is budgeted at between 130 and 140 million euros (between 141 and 153 million US dollars, at the current exchange rate).

The agreements were signed at the start of the ""Global Gateway' business and investment forum between Mozambique and the EU held in Maputo.

The purpose of the two day event is to draw up strategies to attract investment to Mozambique.

""Our conviction and expectation for this Forum rest on our strategic partnership with the European Union as our largest multilateral trading partner, and in the certainty that it is best to invest and do business in Mozambique and with Mozambicans', declared the Minister of Industry and Trade, Silvino Moreno.

""Our joint commitment', he added, ""is to hold this event repeatedly with the active participation of businesses and for their benefit'.

Opening the event, Prime Minister Adriano Maleiane hoped the forum would be a platform to strengthen business cooperation between Mozambique and the EU, and would increasingly involve the private business sector.

It should become ""a true corporate and strategic platform to promote and capitalize upon business and investment opportunities that will strengthen the relations between Mozambican and European businesses'.

Maleiane invited European business people to continue investing, particularly in Mozambican agriculture and energy.

""Our country has immeasurable agro-ecological potential, which allows a diversified agriculture and the development of value chains that can drive industrialization', he said.

Mozambique also has great potential in terms of renewable and environmentally-friendly sources of energy, with particular stress on hydro-electricity, wind and solar power, and natural gas, said the Prime Minister.

For his part, Simone Santi, representing the European Chamber of Commerce (Eurocam), declared that Mozambique ""is the right country for entrepreneurs to invest in'.

Agostinho Vuma, chairperson of the Confederation of Mozambican Business Associations (CTA), said the presence of European businesses has contributed greatly to the growth of Mozambique's Gross Domestic Product.

Private European investment in Mozambique to date has exceeded 60 billion US dollars.

The five agreements were signed by Mozambican Foreign Minister Veronica Macamo and by the EU Commissioner for Energy, Kadri Simson.

The agreements include the rehabilitation of the Cahora Bassa hydro-electric dam and power station on the Zambezi, and the ""Vamoz Digital' Initiative, intended to reduce the ""digital divide'. This is intended to support a policy and regulatory framework that will stimulate innovation, the skills of young people and the inclusion of girls and women, particularly those living in situations of vulnerability.

Maputo, 23 Nov (AIM) - The Mozambican Attorney General, Beatriz Buchili, believes that the country is complying with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which in October 2022 placed Mozambique on the Grey List, which means that it is under enhanced surveillance as a jurisdiction that presents risks for money laundering and financing of terrorism.

According to Buchili, who was speaking on Wednesday at a National Meeting of the Central Office for Combating Corruption (GCCC), in Maputo, ""the placement of Mozambique under enhanced surveillance aims, among other things, to ensure that the national authorities quickly eliminate the deficiencies identified in their system for preventing and combating money laundering and terrorist financing.'

As a way of reversing the situation, she said, the Public Prosecutor's Office is carrying out various training sessions for magistrates and investigators from the National Criminal Investigation Service (SERNIC) to improve the investigation of financial and economic crimes and increase the number of people charged.

According to Buchili, the country continues to face enormous challenges in the fight against corruption, given that this type of crime has served as an instrument for preparing other crimes, such as kidnapping, drug trafficking and illegal immigration.

The meeting brought together the Bank of Mozambique, judicial magistrates, the Public Prosecutor's Office and SERNIC.

Maputo, 23 Nov (AIM) - Mozambique's Central Office for the Fight against Corruption (GCCC) announced on Wednesday that it had initiated criminal proceedings in 1,175 cases of corruption over the last 10 months.

According to Romualdo Jhonam, spokesperson for the GCCC, 803 cases have been charged and the rest are being investigated.

Jhonam, who was speaking at a National Meeting of the GCCC, in Maputo under the theme ""Strengthening the Public Prosecutor's Office in the Prevention and Fight against Corruption and Money Laundering', said that the highest number of corruption cases were in Maputo, and in the central provinces of Sofala and Zambézia.

The aim of the meeting is to analyze ways of speeding up anti-corruption cases, the contribution of information and communication technologies, the intervention capacity of the central anti-corruption office, and territorial coverage in terms of infrastructure.

The event was attended by the director of the GCCC, judicial magistrates, representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, and of the Bank of Mozambique, investigators from the National Criminal Investigation Service (Sernic), among others.

Maputo, 23 Nov (AIM) - Three trucks loaded with support from Mozambique are now on their way to Palestine, according to a report in the independent newssheet ""Carta de Mocambique'.

This solidarity results from contributions from several civil society organisations.

According to a member of the leadership of the Association of Solidarity with Palestine, Momade Amade, the trucks are being loaded by three Mozambicans in Cairo.

The three left Maputo for the Egyptian capital a week ago, and arrived in Cairo last Friday. They made the purchases in coordination with the Palestinian Embassy and with various other organisations operating in Cairo, such as the Egyptian Red Crescent.

The goods carried by the three trucks include foodstuffs, hygiene products, medicines and clothing. They were purchased with funds from a campaign launched in Mozambique three weeks ago by three organisations, namely the Mozambican Association with the Palestinian People, the Almoniz Foundation, and the Organisation of Moslem Business People.

""The campaign was launched here in Mozambique to raise funds, and three people were delegated to take the money, converted into dollars through Mozambican banks, so that they could purchase the goods in Cairo', said Amade. ""We thought this was the easiest procedure'.

""Our colleagues made the purchases in Cairo and hired the trucks', he added. ""But we don't have a forecast for when they will arrive in Palestine, since the process is rather complicated. There is an enormous queue of trucks at the Rafah crossing (between Egypt and Gaza), and there is a bureaucratic procedure that must be followed after crossing the border'.

Asked about any involvement of the Mozambican government in this initiative, Amade said this is ""a popular movement' and the organisations just informed the government.

Dombe (Mozambique), 23 Nov (AIM) - Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi on Wednesday inaugurated a new water supply system in the Dombe administrative post, in Sussundenga district, in the central province of Manica.

In its initial phase, this system will provide clean water for more than 6,000 people in the four neighourhoods of the Dombe headquarters. This will eventually rise to 8,000 people.

Work on the system began in 2015. It started to operate, but was then destroyed by Cyclone Idai in 2019. Rehabilitation, and the opening of new water sources began in 2022, and the work was completed this month.

The system was budgeted at 35 million meticais (about 547,000 US dollars, at the current exchange rate), disbursed by the Mozambican government, with the support of the United Kingdom. The system was built under the National Rural Water and Sanitation Programme (Pronasar).

Dombe is a semi-arid region which faces serous water shortages. Thus, much of the Dombe population resorts to unsafe sources such as artisanal wells and the Lucite river. Some households are obliged to walk long distances to fetch water.

Nyusi said that in 2020 only six out of every ten people in Dombe had access to safe drinking water. Thanks to the new system, the number has now risen to between seven and eight out of every ten.

The President declared ""our purpose is to serve the population. So we are mobilizing resources to provide more water facilities for Mozambicans. Many water systems are currently under construction'.

Nyusi urged his audience to take measures to prevent the spread of cholera. The disease is raging in Zimbabwe, which borders on Manica.

""Cholera is a dangerous disease and it kills people', he said. ""Let's avoid cholera by washing foodstuffs properly, particularly those that are eaten raw. We cannot let the disease strike at our communities'.

""All of us should make this effort', Nyusi stressed. ""We have clean water here and we have the conditions to avoid the disease, if we practice individual and collective hygiene'."

1142227701,20231124,"(MENAFN- UkrinForm) Fifty-five UN Member States signed the Ukraine-initiated Declaration on the occasion of the ninetieth anniversary of the Holodomor of 1932-1933 in Ukraine.

According to an Ukrinform correspondent in New York, the document underscores that“the Holodomor is the national tragedy of the Ukrainian people that took millions of innocent lives and was caused by the cruel actions and policies of the totalitarian regime.”

“The tragedy of the Holodomor should be a reminder for present and future generations of the need to unconditionally respect human rights, including the right to life in order to prevent the repetition of such tragedies, as well as to prevent the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, in particular by disrupting production and supply chains that increases global food insecurity, especially for the most vulnerable,” the declaration says.

The declaration calls for honoring the memory of the victims of the Holodomor,“a man-made deadly famine that took the lives of millions of Ukrainians, including persons of other nationalities who lived in Ukraine at the time"", condemns the cruel policies pursued by the Stalinist regime, reiterates the commitment of all Member States to accelerate actions to end hunger, enshrined in the declaration endorsed by the UN General Assembly in September 2023.

The declaration was signed, in particular, by the countries of the European Union, Azerbaijan, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Guatemala, Chile, Japan, South Korea, Great Britain, the United States, Uruguay, Costa Rica, the Marshall Islands and Palau.

As reported by Ukrinform, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, adopted a statement on the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor of 1932-1933 in Ukraine and called on international organizations and parliaments to recognize it as genocide against the Ukrainian people."
1142227705,20231124,"Violent clashes broke out between protesters and police in Dublin on Thursday after a knife attack in the city left five people, including three children, injured, media reports said.

According to reports, the streets of Dublin are mostly calm.

""Dublin city centre is now calm and returning to normal,"" Chief Superintendent Patrick McMenamin was quoted as saying by RTE.

The gardai, as the Irish police are known, told CNN in a statement, “Further information and details of specific incidents we be provided at the conclusion of this operation.”

Several videos are circulating on social media where protesters could be seen destroying police vehicles.

Some protesters can be heard on video chanting anti-immigrant slogans, reported CNN.

How did the clash begin:

The unrest began in Dublin following a heated demonstration at the scene of the stabbing attack on five people.

A crowd of between 100 and 200 people, some of whom wore scarves to cover their faces, confronted gardaí verbally before clashes erupted with riot police, news portal reported.

The protesters were seen holding tricolours and an ""Irish lives matter"" sign during the violent demonstration.

What led to the clash

Police have arrested a person for allegedly stabbing five people including three children.

Police said the incident occurred on Parnell Square.

The Irish police said they aren’t considering terrorism as a motive for the “serious assault” in the city,reported CNN.

European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned the incident and posted on X:""Shocked by the brutal attack that injured several people in Dublin, including children.""

""Grateful to first responders who tended to the victims and to the people who intervened on the scene. Tonight my thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the people of Ireland,"" she said.

Ireland’s Justice Minister Helen McEntee said the incident left her 'deeply shocked'.

""A thuggish and manipulative element must not be allowed use an appalling tragedy to wreak havoc,"" she said."

1142229991,20231124,"Delegates to the two-day Anti-Corruption Symposium that ended in Lilongwe yesterday have made a strong call to political leaders to grant anti-graft agencies true independence.

Representatives of nine Southern African Development Community (Sadc) anti-corruption agencies earlier on Wednesday held a closed door meeting at the Bingu International Convention Centre (BICC) during the symposium organised by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) as part of its 25th anniversary.

The closing ceremony took place at the same venue yesterday with President Lazarus Chakwera, diplomats and other dignitaries in attendance.

Speaking on behalf of leaders of anti-corruption agencies, Namibian Anti-Corruption Agency director general Paulus Noa said it was learnt in their discussion that some agencies within the region have “compromised independence”.

In an interview, he could not name the countries, but stressed that the issue of political interference in anti-corruption agencies was discussed at length.

Said Noa: “I will not identify the countries, but it was an issue that was raised. There was even someone who said in their country the anti-corruption agency is not even functional and there are attempts to merge it with Ombudsman’s office.”

Noa said independence of these institutions must be stipulated in the law, especially the Constitution, which is usually not easy to manipulate.

In Malawi, the ACB is established by an Act of Parliament.

On whether this legal status compromises their independence, ACB director general Martha Chizuma said she had not personally reflected on the implication.

In her speech yesterday, she did not directly raise the issue of political interference or lack of true independence, but spoke about how the fight against corruption has put individual officers of the bureau at risk.

Chizuma said while the bureau fights corruption in the interest of the public, corruption fights back at individuals.

The ACB head said the 25 years that the bureau has been in existence has seen both ups and down and the organisation of this symposium offers more lessons for the future.

South Africa’s National Director of Prosecution Shamila Bathohi who was the key note speaker applauded Chizuma for the work that she is doing at the ACB.

She, too, added her voice on the call for independence of the graft-busting bodies.

European Union Ambassador Rune Skinnebach, whose institution funded the symposium, also joined calls to promote independence of the ACB.

Chakwera was the highest political leader at the venue and his speech called on citizens not to despair, but continue fighting against corruption.

Minister of Justice Titus Mvalo pledged commitment to ensure the Lifestyle Audit Manual that the ACB submitted to him gets Cabinet approval.

The manual seeks to improve the effectiveness of governance bodies such as ACB in the fight against corruption."

1142232524,20231124,"On 22 November 2023, Centaurium UAS and Thales signed a cooperation agreement which also comprises the delivery of two Thales UAS100 drone systems and ground control stations to the Switzerland-based company ahead of testing in the spring of 2024 and the planned start of commercial operations in 2025.

From risk monitoring on large-scale infrastructure to border surveillance, event security, fire detection and location of missing persons, the UAS100 meets the requirements of a wide range of mission scenarios while operating in full compliance with general aviation regulations.

Centaurium UAS will operate the drones and offer services tailored to the specific needs of public and private players in Switzerland, with lower operating costs and 90% lower energy consumption than current piloted aircraft.

Centaurium UAS is positioned as a service provider for monitoring, surveillance and alert missions. Use cases include inspection of critical infrastructure and industrial installations such as high-voltage lines and transport routes, monitoring of natural disasters, border surveillance and security for major events, as well as flights to locate missing persons and provide situational awareness in support of search and rescue and other emergency operations. Centaurium UAS will rely on Thales’s UAS100 technology for the necessary flight avionics, benefitting from its highly robust design, built-in security, versatility and scalability, and a latest-generation ground control station that meets the criteria for European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification.

The avionics of the UAS100 combines the certified levels of flight safety and security of Thales solutions for the aerospace sector with the lightweight and compact design needed for integration on a light UAV. With an aerostructure developed by light aircraft manufacturer Issoire Aviation, the UAS100 concept offers levels of performance, integrity and reliability with no equivalent in Europe.

The UAS100 is powered by two electric motors and a small internal combustion engine, ensuring the necessary endurance and resilience to failure. Equipped with a jam-resistant navigation system, a redundant computer for critical missions and a smart communication system, it can fly autonomously in complete safety. The UAS100 will be marketed in two versions: the UAS100-1, which is already available and has a wingspan of 3.34 metres, a length of 1.78 metres and a payload capacity of 1 kilogram; and the UAS100-10, which is twice the size and offers a payload capacity of 10 kg to accommodate very high-performance sensors.

The ground control station — the nerve centre for planning, control and supervision of drone operations — will be supplied to Centaurium UAS in November, with delivery of the first UAS100-1 in March 2024 for initial trials. Centaurium UAS plans to begin commercial operations in 2025, once authorisation is obtained from the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA)."
1142236938,20231124,"It is hard to fathom why nearly three years after being key architect of the new agreement to guide relations between the European Union (EU) and the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS), Jamaica scrabbled to reassure itself that what the document says and the commitments it makes comport with national law.

Prime Minister Andrew Holness and his foreign minister, Kamina Johnson Smith, must therefore respond with greater clarity than they have so far managed as to why the administration has shilly-shallied on the matter. The Government must clearly stand firm for important principles, including the universal principles of human rights, gender equality, individual privacy and freedom from discrimination.

It is tempting to claim that this development is an aberration. Unfortunately, cynics will hear echoes of the recent fiasco at the United Nations (UN) when Jamaica failed to vote on a General Assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian pause to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, although Kingston said it supported the resolution and had delivered a statement on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) underlining the very sentiments. Jamaica’s explanation consultations were not complete in time for the vote, which presumably meant that its UN staff were still seeking instructions from headquarters on how to vote. Yet, four minutes before the ballot, the very diplomats actively abstained in a vote on a Canadian amendment to the resolution. Despite the explanations, cynics will probably believe that something significant transpired within those handful of minutes.

With respect to the latest issue, the Samoa Agreement essentially establishes the broad framework within which the 27 EU members and the 79 OACPS countries are to conduct their economic and political relations over the next 20 years. The document is long on broad and universal aspirations, but short on specifics – in part because of trade relations between the EU and what used to be the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries are now covered by a series of regional Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). In the case of the Caribbean, a regional EPA has been in place since 2008. Further, specific arrangements for the management of the EU’s aid to OACPS is not part of this treaty.

Importantly, too, there is no fundamental departure in the language of the Samoa Agreement from that of its Cotonou predecessor, or, for that matter, from the language of countless other international agreements to which Jamaica is a party. It affirms democracy, the rule of law and the upholding of human rights, including the protection of all individuals against discrimination.

Further, the language of the Samoa agreement and what it proposes are things that Ms Johnson Smith and her technocrats at the foreign ministry ought to be well aware of, given the role they played in negotiating the accord.

In 2018, for instance, the foreign minister chaired the ACP ministerial council that finalised the group’s negotiating mandate for the post-Cotonou pact. She also chaired several other related sessions during the negotiations.

In December 2020, as the agreement was being finalised, Ms Johnson Smith said at an OACPS conference: “Once the post-Cotonou Agreement has been initialled and subsequently signed in Samoa, let us ensure that this landmark agreement is effectively implemented in a manner that takes the OACPS-EU relationship to a higher level, that enables the Caribbean-EU partnership to realise its full potential that advances sustainable development in all our regions, and that further sustains intra-OACPS cooperation.”

That signing took place in Samoa’s capital of Apia on November 15. So far, 47 OACPS states have initialled the document. Jamaica did not participate.

According to Ms Johnson Smith, Kingston pulled out because of concerns “which continue to be raised on the domestic space”. While the minister did not identify the concerns or their source, she gave an assurance of the Government’s unfailing protection of Jamaica’s interest, “with the laws of Jamaica as our guide”.

Which is expected in negotiations the Government conducts on behalf of the Jamaican State. Agreements are vetted by the Government’s lawyers to ensure that they align with domestic law and are within the framework of the island’s Constitution.

Notwithstanding that the minister did not name those who have objected to the Samoa Agreement, it is known that an anti-gay rights, anti-abortion group called Jamaica Coalition for a Healthy Society has campaigned against the agreement. Their claim, apparently, is that the EU is using the pact to promote and normalise homosexuality, as well as the disruption of accepted family values in Jamaica and elsewhere.

What the agreement does in fact do is commit the parties to gender equality, non-discrimination and the provision of “universal access to sexual and reproductive health commodities and healthcare services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes”. It also calls for the parties to stand by other international agreements, to which Jamaica is already a signatory.

On Tuesday, Ms Johnson Smith declared: “...while we are confident that the agreement will not supersede any Jamaica law, what we want to be made clear …. (is) that at the point of signing … the interpretation that we expect is crystal.”

The Government should urgently act on that commitment – unless it intends to opt out of the partnership arrangement with the EU."

1142245474,20231124,"It’s been quite a week for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI – and co-founder Sam Altman.

Altman, who helped start OpenAI as a non-profit research lab back in 2015, was removed as CEO Friday in a sudden and mostly unexplained exit that stunned the industry. And while his chief executive title was swiftly reinstated just days later, a lot of questions are still up in the air.

Altman is co-founder of OpenAI, the San Francisco-based company behind ChatGPT, the chatbot that’s seemingly in use everywhere today – from schools to healthcare.

The explosion of ChatGPT since its arrival one year ago propelled Altman into the spotlight of the rapid commercialisation of generative AI, which can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. And as he became Silicon Valley’s most sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of this technology, Altman helped transform OpenAI into a world-renowned start-up.

But his position at OpenAI hit some rocky turns in a whirlwind that was the past week. Altman was fired as CEO Friday, but days later, he was back on the job with a new board of directors.

Within that time, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has rights to its existing technology, helped drive Altman’s return, quickly hiring him as well as another OpenAI co-founder and former president, Greg Brockman, who quit in protest after the CEO’s ousting. Meanwhile, hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to resign.

Both Altman and Brockman celebrated their returns to the company in posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, early Wednesday.

There’s a lot that remains unknown about Altman’s initial ousting. Last Friday’s announcement said he was “not consistently candid in his communications” with the then-board of directors, which refused to provide more specific details.

Regardless, the news sent shockwaves throughout the AI world, and, because OpenAI and Altman are such leading players in this space, may raise trust concerns around a burgeoning technology that many people still have questions about.

“The OpenAI episode shows how fragile the AI ecosystem is right now, including addressing AI’s risks,” said Johann Laux, an expert at the Oxford Internet Institute focusing on human oversight of artificial intelligence.

The turmoil also accentuated the differences between Altman and members of the company’s previous board, who have expressed various views on the safety risks posed by AI as the technology advances.

Multiple experts add that this drama highlights how it should be governments – and not big tech companies – that should be calling the shots on AI regulation, particularly for fast-evolving technologies like generative AI.

“The events of the last few days have not only jeopardised OpenAI’s attempt to introduce more ethical corporate governance in the management of their company, but it also shows that corporate governance alone, even when well-intended, can easily end up cannibalized by other corporate’s dynamics and interests,” said Enza Iannopollo, principal analyst at Forrester.

The lesson, Iannopollo said, is that companies can’t alone deliver the level of safety and trust in AI that society needs. “Rules and guardrails, designed with companies and enforced by regulators with rigour, are crucial if we are to benefit from AI,” he added.

Unlike traditional AI, which processes data and completes tasks using predetermined rules, generative AI – including chatbots like ChatGPT – can create something new.

Tech companies are still leading the show when it comes to governing AI and its risks, while governments around the world work to catch up.

In the European Union, negotiators are putting the final touches on what’s expected to be the world’s first comprehensive AI regulations. But they’ve reportedly been bogged down over whether and how to include the most contentious and revolutionary AI products, the commercialised large-language models that underpin generative AI systems including ChatGPT.

Chatbots were barely mentioned when Brussels first laid out its initial draft legislation in 2021, which focused on AI with specific uses. But officials have been racing to figure out how to incorporate these systems, also known as foundation models, into the final version.

Meanwhile, in the United States, President Joe Biden signed an ambitious executive order last month seeking to balance the needs of cutting-edge technology companies with national security and consumer rights.

The order – which will likely need to be augmented by congressional action – is an initial step that is meant to ensure that AI is trustworthy and helpful, rather than deceptive and destructive. It seeks to steer how AI is developed so that companies can profit without putting public safety in jeopardy."
1142247822,20231124,"More than 3,500 Ghana­ians who left the country in search of greener pastures have been assisted to voluntarily return home since 2017; data from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Ghana has shown.

Of the figure, over 3,200 are males with the rest comprising; women and children, while the majority of the adults fall between the age range of 18 and 30 years.

The data, made available to the Ghanaian Times in an exclusive interview, shows that they returned from more than 30 European and African countries primarily Libya, Niger, Burkina Faso, Morocco and Algeria.

Their arrival was facilitated under the European Union (EU) -IOM Joint Initiative (JI) for Migrant Protection and Reintegration Programme in collaboration with government agencies.

Last year, 1,050 returnees arrived via char­tered flights and as of October this year, 460 followed with more expected to join them later.

Commenting on the development, a Rein­tegration Assistant of IOM Ghana, Victoria Adomako said beyond the data more people have been supported to return home under other voluntary programmes.

She said Bono towns including Techiman, and others in Bono East Region, witnessed a substantial influx of returnees, followed by Ashanti where returnees went to towns like Aboaso, Mamponten, Ejura, and Aboabo.

In Greater Accra, she said areas like Nima, Ashaiman, and Madina and Kasoa in the Cen­tral Region experience significant numbers of returning individuals while there are increas­ing returns to the Northern and Western parts of the country.

She said the returned who often reach out to IOM in their countries of destina­tion come home due to unfulfilled dreams, conflicts and other factors which had left a diverse impact on them, including trauma and regret.

“For returns from JIs, we have a lot of Ghanaians returning with mental issues be­cause of the trauma they have been through in their migration journeys. We have trained clinical psychologists and therapists who provide services to them,” she said.

Ms Adomako explained that under the IOM’s comprehensive initiatives, pre-depar­ture counseling, economic, social, and psychosocial support were provided and they are equipped with the necessary tools for success­ful reintegration, including skill development, educa­tion for children, and social support.

She said the IOM had partnerships with state agencies Youth Employment Authori­ty, and the Ghana Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Commission who help to support the returnees to set up in the agriculture, trade and other areas de­pending on their interests and skills acquired during their sojourn.

“We give social support and education for the children and minors,” she said.

On challenges, Ms Adomako mentioned the stigmatisation of returnees and obstacles in accessing healthcare after they arrive home; the absence of a common platform for data effective policy implementation and deci­sion-making.

She advocated a comprehensive govern­ment involvement, while skills development and entrepreneurship drive should be in­creased to address unemployment, one of the key reasons for the migration.

For his part, an IOM Ghana Reintegration and Community Outreach Assistant, Collins Yeboah said some of the returnees travel using regular channels, but overstayed and ended up in irregular situations.

He said the IOM Ghana had intensified awareness creation at Schools and in commu­nities while it had created an information por­tal (IOM X/Waka Well) to provide accurate travel information to the public.

He said IOM was not against migration because it had socio-economic benefits, but it would encourage the public to embark on safe and orderly migration."
1142252209,20231124,"AMSTERDAM -- The Netherlands, long regarded as one of Europe's most socially liberal countries, woke up to a drastically changed political landscape Thursday after a far-right party swept national elections in a result that has reverberated throughout Europe.

Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom, which advocates banning the Quran, closing Islamic schools and entirely halting the acceptance of asylum-seekers, won 37 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, making it by far the biggest party, in a clear rebuke of the country's political establishment.

The results, tabulated overnight after Wednesday's voting, give Wilders enough support to try to form a governing coalition. Centrist and center-right parties long wary of the firebrand have left the door ajar to a possible partnership, giving Wilders a chance to become the Netherlands' first far-right prime minister.

Wilders called on other parties to constructively engage in coalition talks. Pieter Omtzigt, a former centrist Christian Democrat who built his own New Social Contract party in three months to take 20 seats, said he would always be open to talks.

""It will be a complicated formation process. It is up to responsible politicians to form a government, one way or another,"" Omtzigt said, according to Dutch news site Nu.nl.

Congratulations rolled in Thursday from all sides where the far right holds some sway on the continent after anti-Islam firebrand Wilders scored an election victory as unexpected as it was massive. His party more than doubled in size in Parliament to tower over mainstream parties that long specialized in marginalizing him.

Suddenly on Thursday, there was hope in the air again for nationalist conservative populists, especially with a European Parliament election coming up in June.

""All of Europe wants a political turnaround,"" said Alice Weidel, the leader of German far-right party AfD, or Alternative for Germany, as she congratulated Wilders on his win.

While people across the political spectrum expressed surprise at the election outcome, and the Dutch reputation of liberalism persists, experts say that Wilders succeeded by tapping into a discontent with government that dates back at least two decades.

""It's not suddenly out of nowhere,"" said Janka Stoker, a professor of leadership and organizational change at the University of Groningen.

Wilders has been a persistent political presence in the Netherlands through those years, and now it seemed his time had come.

A career politician, Wilders has served as a member of the Dutch House of Representatives since 1998. In 2004, he split from the party headed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, forming the Party for Freedom two years later.

Exceptionally, Wilders' party is not based on a membership structure, making him the sole decision-maker and synonymous with his party.

Like Wilders, Marine Le Pen in France has been dreaming of grasping power for more than a decade. She now has another powerful ally with a similar loathing of the EU. The 27-nation bloc is on the radar of just about every populist far-right politician, derided as a bullying behemoth that smothers national identities yet offers free entry to people who undermine what they see as traditional Christian values.

""It shows that more and more countries within the European Union contest the way it works ... and hope that we can again master a migration that is considered by many Europeans as both massive and anarchic,"" Le Pen said Thursday on France-Inter radio.

And as a founding member of the EU, and a vital trading link between many of its most powerful nations, the Netherlands might have issues with cutting the umbilical cord to the bloc.

Wilders calls for a ""Nexit"" referendum -- a Dutch version of Brexit which saw the United Kingdom leave the EU. By nature, Dutch politics rely on coalitions between several parties, and no other suitable party has followed Wilders in that position.

""He can never rule on his own, and I cannot imagine any kind of coalition majority that would choose a confrontation with Europe,"" said professor Hendrik Vos of Ghent University, an expert on EU politics. ""The Netherlands just has too much at stake in the EU market. It is unthinkable. And you have already seen him tone down some of his rhetoric,"" Vos said.

At times Wilders has been compared to former President Donald Trump, for his penchant for saying things in blunt and divisive ways. Many of Wilders' supporters say they feel buoyed and relieved that he is willing to give voice to what they cannot say or feel they are not supposed to say.

Over the years, Wilders' comments about Moroccan immigrants in the Netherlands have gotten widespread media attention. They have also landed him in court.

At a campaign event in 2017, Wilders referred to Moroccan immigrants as ""scum.""

During the current campaign, he ran on a ""Dutch First"" platform, though in the final days of the race, he moderated some of his anti-Islam vitriol, saying there were ""more important priorities.""

He also said that his proposals ""would be within the law and Constitution,"" in an effort to court other parties to govern with him.

But while his language may have softened, his party platform did not. ""The Netherlands is not an Islamic country: no Islamic schools, Qurans and mosques,"" it says.

""The borders are wide open and everyone who comes in wants a living space,"" it adds, while advocating a ""zero tolerance"" policy to rein in what it calls ""street terrorists"" and promising funding for 10,000 extra police officers.

""The police need to be in charge in the street again,"" according to the platform. ""Criminals have to be arrested immediately and put in prison for a long time.""

One of the most prominent Muslim organizations in the Netherlands said it had received emails expressing support since the election result.

""That's reassuring,"" the Contact Group Muslims and Government said in a statement. ""In addition, Mr. Wilders has said that he will become prime minister of all Dutch people, regardless of their religion, sex or color. The Netherlands is a state governed by the rule of law and we trust that it is a tolerant country.""

Wilders -- as well as other politicians, including Omtzigt, a centrist who had hoped to upend the election -- had linked an increase in migrants to a shortage of housing, which was among the biggest issues for Dutch voters.

But it was Wilders who ultimately spoke to a discontent that experts said could be traced back at least to the rise of Pim Fortuyn, a right-wing populist who was assassinated a week before elections in which he had led the opinion polls. Fortuyn, who hoped to become the Netherlands' first gay prime minister, ran on a strong anti-immigrant platform more than 20 years ago.

Voter dissatisfaction was also evident in more recent elections: Regional votes, which decide the makeup of the Dutch Senate, saw big victories in 2019 by populist newcomers.

Last year, 60% of Dutch people said they were unhappy with how politics was done in the country, according to the Netherlands Institute for Social Research.

Elections are often a reaction to what happened previously, Stoker said, referring to Rutte's record-breaking 13-year tenure as prime minister. The Rutte government collapsed in July over disputes on immigration policy, precipitating Wednesday's election.

While Rutte has been a stalwart of Dutch politics, several scandals that plagued his leadership added to an erosion in trust in the government, according to Dutch political experts. Rutte will stay on as caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed.

In the final days of the campaign, Wilders started inching up in the polls, partly helped by what many people regarded as strong performances in televised debates, a stronger media focus on him and a slight softening of some of his extreme positions on Islam.

But the margin of victory was unexpected. Wilders' party has often performed better in opinion polls than in elections. This time, the trend reversed.

""These were the most volatile elections ever. Never before have so many seats changed hands,"" said Tom van der Meer, a professor in political science at the University of Amsterdam.

1142254471,20231124,"On Thursday, businesses and tech groups cautioned the European Union against excessive regulation of foundation models, a type of artificial intelligence system, in the forthcoming AI rules. They emphasized that such over-regulation could potentially stifle the growth of emerging start-ups or force them to relocate from the region, reported Reuters.

The appeal was made as European Union nations and lawmakers enter the concluding phase of negotiations on regulations that may establish the standard for other countries.

One major point of disagreement revolves around foundation models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. These are AI systems trained on extensive datasets, equipped with the capability to learn from new data and execute various tasks, adds the report.

""For Europe to become a global digital powerhouse, we need companies that can lead on AI innovation also using foundation models and GPAI,"" DigitalEurope, whose members include Airbus, Apple, Ericsson, Google, LSE and SAP, wrote in a letter.

""As European digital industry representatives, we see a huge opportunity in foundation models, and new innovative players emerging in this space, many of them born here in Europe. Let's not regulate them out of existence before they get a chance to scale, or force them to leave,"" said the companies.

The letter also received endorsements from thirty-two European digital associations. GPAI, which stands for general-purpose artificial intelligence, was mentioned in the communication. The signatories, noting that only three percent of the world's AI unicorns originate from the European Union, expressed support for a collaborative proposal by France, Germany, and Italy. The proposal aims to restrict the scope of AI rules for foundation models specifically to transparency requirements.

They also mentioned that the existing expansive scope of the draft AI rules might conflict with prevailing legislation in certain sectors, such as healthcare.

""We are increasingly frustrated at what we see as a lack of interest in the effects on the medical sector. Our impression is that people don't care about the content any more, they just want to get it done. We are simply collateral damage,"" said spokesperson Georgina Prodhan at Siemens Healthineers.

The companies also rejected appeals from creative industries to address copyright issues within the AI rules.

""The EU's comprehensive copyright protection and enforcement framework already contains provisions that can help address AI-related copyright issues, such as the text and data mining exemption and corresponding,"" added companies.

1142254482,20231124,"The EU should use its common budget as an incentive to make member states commit more capabilities and personnel to the bloc’s future crisis response force, the EU’s top general, Robert Brieger, told Euractiv.

“There’s unfortunately a big array of crises [around Europe], the situation is worsening rather than becoming better and we have to have a tool for rapid deployment of such an entry force,” the Austrian general said in an interview.

The bloc’s future 5,000-strong Rapid Deployment Capacity (RDC) “is a modular and scalable tool – a small one – that can be used as an entrance force, a first responder, for more to come afterwards, for crises management mainly, outside the EU.”

The RDC was established by the EU’s Strategic Compass, the bloc’s first military strategy, and is meant to be operational by 2025 and used as the first responder force in a crisis outside the EU, for evacuation, delivery of humanitarian aid, capacity building or peace enforcement.

Until then, more work is needed for it to become operational. During the first force generation conference, “a lot of offers were taken into account, but there are still some gaps, especially in the first semester of 2025,” Brieger said, adding that “we try to fill them within the months to come”.

Brieger, chairman of the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), the highest military body in the EU, advises the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, on military matters.

EU member states pledged to the bloc’s future joint force after a first operational exercise on the coast of Spain in October with the participation of nineteen out of 27 EU countries.

“For this endeavour, we for sure need incentives – besides the political will – for member states to buy in this new system,” Brieger also said, hinting that turning political commitments into actual commitments would be a challenge.

Asked what gaps were identified, Brieger answered they concerned “especially the first semester of 2025, when there’s one battlegroup missing [in the roster]”.

More generally, EU countries need to step up the amount of equipment they could earmark for the RDC, he said.

“We have gaps for strategic enablers; for instance, joint logistics or strategic transport,” he said in reference to the lack of a long-term solution to complement the arrangement with the European Air Transport Command (EATC) in case of short notice needs for transportation.

Another gap to fill to make the RDC really operational relates to work on military mobility across the continent – to facilitate the ease of movement of troops and equipment with infrastructure, procedures and less red tape.

To push EU member states to commit more troops and equipment, the EU’s military committee is “thinking about some sort of covering common costs: part of the expenditure will be covered by European financial resources”.

“The discussion is ongoing now on how far can we use the European Peace Facility (EPF) or administrative budget,” he said.

The EPF is an inter-governmental fund used to provide defence equipment to third states, pay for the EU’s military missions and operations, and the RDC’s exercises.

“We are discussing financial support or a certain amount of common cost for EU exercises, for the missions and operations and also for the use of the RDC,” the general said, adding that the idea would need endorsement from the politicians.

While the principle that the costs lie where they fall is the “priority. (…) We need the incentive to at least cover some costs, like for instance strategic transport, logistics costs, housing etc, so that member states are more willing to participate than in the past”.

The current format of the European force – the EU battlegroups – has never been used in the field.

Compared to a battlegroup, the RDC is larger in size, involves an EU overview of personnel and equipment available in the roster, combines air force, maritime, cyber, land and space assets, and is based on clear scenarios in which it could be used.

“We didn’t use the battlegroups because there was no political will, there was no sufficient budget”, while “there have been in the past opportunities and necessities to use them and I think opportunities are sure to come also in the future”, such as the evacuation from Sudan after the coup d’état.

Eastern member states such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland have expressed numerous times the wish to preserve the US-led Western military alliance NATO’s force model and avoid jeopardising its reaction abilities with the EU.

One of the main arguments raised against the RDC is that an EU member which is also a NATO-allied country cannot assign the same personnel and equipment to both organisations’ force models and commands and deploy them in two places at once, according to the ‘single set of forces’ principle.

Concretely, if the EU were seeking to evacuate Kabul’s airport, but the same French troops in the roster were also called under NATO command to defend Estonia, Paris would have to choose where to send its troops. To avoid this issue, the concept calls for troops and equipment to stand under one command at a time.

Asked whether they were looking to by-pass the concept, Brieger said: “I wouldn’t say by-pass, but make smart use of it or interpret it in a creative manner”.

“I can imagine that, for instance, a force earmarked for a long term under a NATO preparedness phase could still be used for a short term, for instance, for humanitarian aid or assistance, in an operation context within the EU”.

The NATO model is based on the availability of 300,000 personnel while the EU’s is 5,000 troops strong."
1142262109,20231124,"Serbia has acquired 11 Russian-made Mi35 helicopter gunships from Cyprus to bolster its air force and maintain regional military supremacy, its President Aleksandar Vucic said.

The Cypriot government and Serbia agreed in 2021 on the purchase of ageing Mi35s that require an overhaul for an unspecified price, part of which Belgrade paid by exporting Serbian-made weapons.

“We have paid more than half to our Cypriot brothers with our weapons … mainly … artillery,” Vucic told reporters at a presentation at the Batajnica military air base near Belgrade.

He also announced a sale of 48 Serbian-made self-propelled howitzers worth €311 million to an unspecified country.

“This procedure must still go through their parliament,” Vucic said.

The announcement was made soon after President Nikos Christodoulides visited Belgrade, where closer defence ties were on the agenda.

Nicosia is also a keen supporter of Serbia’s EU ambitions.

Serbia, a candidate to join the European Union that has one of the largest armies in the Western Balkans, still relies on ex-Soviet military technology, but in recent years, it started purchasing Western and Chinese weapon systems and aircraft.

In June, Vucic said Belgrade was negotiating the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France’s Dassault.

Serbia has already bought Airbus helicopters and transport planes.

Serbia is militarily neutral, but it joined the NATO Partnership for Peace, a programme for countries which do not aspire to join the alliance.

Belgrade curtailed military cooperation with Moscow after Russia invaded Ukraine and has condemned the invasion.

But unlike the EU and other Western countries, it has not imposed sanctions on Moscow.

Serbia’s military budget is $1.43 billion or 2% of gross domestic product (GDP). (source Reuters)"

1142266954,20231124,"The ETC Securities are designed to provide investors with exposure to a metal without having to take physical delivery of the metal. The underlying ""Metal"" for the ETC Securities is: gold. Each ETC Security relates to a specific amount in weight of Metal, specified in the Final Terms, known as the ""Metal Entitlement per ETC Security"". On any particular day, the ETC Security can be viewed as giving an exposure to that ------amount of Metal as the amount payable in respect of each ETC Security and the value per ETC Security (the ""Value per ETC Security"") is linked to the value of the Metal. In order to back its obligations under the ETC Securities, the Issuer will seek to hold enough Metal to meet its obligations under the ETC Securities. The precise amount it holds at any time may be more or less than the aggregate amount of the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security to reflect the periodic payment of product fees. The proceeds from the disposal of the underlying Metal, plus any interest received on the proceeds of such disposal less any negative interest, net of any deductions, will equal the amount due under the ETC Securities (subject to certain minimum amounts owed). The Metal will be held for the Issuer by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor or replacement) (the ""Secured Account Custodian"") and will be generally held on an ""allocated"" basis. This means that specifically identifiable physical items of the Metal are allocated to the Issuer and are segregated from metal held for other clients of the custodian. However, for operational purposes, small amounts of Metal may be held on an ""unallocated"" basis. This means that the Secured Account Custodian maintains an account in the name of the Issuer which shows them as being entitled to delivery of a particular amount of the Metal but without specific physical metal having been identified. Where Metal is held on an ""unallocated"" basis the right to delivery is a purely contractual right and, as such, the Issuer is an unsecured creditor of the custodian and is exposed to the credit risk of the custodian. The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and any underlying Metal. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as ""Secured Property"" for this Series. Securityholders will not, by reason of holding such Series, have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities. The security will become enforceable if payment of the redemption amount in respect of such ETC Securities is not made when due on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the Scheduled Early Redemption Date (defined below) (if applicable). On the Scheduled Maturity Date, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Final Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Final Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount (defined below) and (ii) 10 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security as at the series issue date (the ""Minimum Debt Principal Amount"") plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Final Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Final Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the volume-weighted average prices per metal unit at which the Metal Agent (defined below) is able to sell the underlying Metal (""Average Metal Sale Price"") during the Final Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Final Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Final Redemption Valuation Date. ""Final Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date specified in the Final Terms or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. ""Specified Interest Amount"" is the amount of interest per ETC Security equal to that ETC Security's pro rata share of the amount of interest which has accrued (if any) on the proceeds of realisation of the underlying Metal deposited into the Series Cash Account (defined below) during or relating to the relevant redemption disposal period. Whilst interest may accrue at a positive, zero or negative rate on the Series Cash Account, the Specified Interest Amount is subject to a minimum of zero and any negative interest shall instead be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the underlying Metal. If any of the early redemption events occur, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Early Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Early Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount and (ii) the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Early Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Early Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the Average Metal Sale Price during the Early Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Early Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Early Redemption Valuation Date. The ""Scheduled Early Redemption Date"" is the 8th business day following the Early Redemption Disposal Period. The ""Early Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date of the occurrence of an early redemption event or the date on which the Trustee gives notice that, due to the occurrence of an event of default, the ETC Securities shall become due and payable at their Early Redemption Amount on the Scheduled Early Redemption Date, or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. There can be no assurance that the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, will be greater than or equal to the amount invested by any securityholder. If the Final Metal Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, plus the Specified Interest Amount falls below the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount, then due to the limited recourse nature of the ETC Securities, securityholders are unlikely to receive payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, in full and may receive zero. The Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount per ETC Security, as applicable, will be determined by reference to the Average Metal Sale Price of the underlying Metal held in respect of the ETC Securities sold during the Final Redemption Disposal Period or Early Redemption Disposal Period, as applicable, by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (or any successor or replacement) as ""Metal Agent"", net of associated deductions and taxes. The Issuer will, on or prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date or Scheduled Early Redemption Date, publish the determination of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, (which shall include publication of the price, volume and date of each sale of underlying Metal during the relevant redemption disposal period, including information on any fees, deductions and/or taxes imposed on such sale, and the determination of the Average Metal Sale Price) on the website maintained on behalf of the Issuer at www.etf.dws.com (or such other website notified by the Issuer for the ETC Securities from time to time). The Metal Agent will pay the aggregate proceeds of such disposals (converted, if necessary, into the currency of the ETC Securities) to the cash account for the Series (the ""Series Cash Account"") maintained by J.P. Morgan SE as ""Account Bank"" as directed by the Programme Administrator (defined below). The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest. On early or final redemption of the ETC Securities, a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security, as the case may be. The ETC Securities are subject to a product fee that accrues on a daily basis. Accrued product fee is paid by a daily reduction in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security which, as a result of such reduction, operates as a charge on securityholders. The Issuer will, using the Metal Agent, periodically realise Metal equal to such charge and the proceeds will be credited to the Series Cash Account maintained by the Account Bank in relation to the ETC Securities and used by the Issuer to pay the product fee to the Programme Administrator in accordance with the Programme Administrator Agreement. Such realisation will happen on a periodic (typically weekly) basis. The Programme Administrator Agreement provides that the Programme Administrator will use the product fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities to pay on behalf of the Issuer the costs of the Programme (as set out in the schedule to the Programme Administrator Agreement) relating to such Series of ETC Securities and the Issuer more generally. The ETC Securities may become due and payable prior to their Scheduled Maturity Date in connection with the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) certain legal or regulatory changes occur in relation to the Issuer and the Issuer gives a notice of redemption; (ii) any agent in relation to the ETC Securities resigns or their appointment is terminated and the Issuer gives notice that no successor or replacement has been appointed within a 60 calendar day period; (iii) the Value per ETC Security is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price as at the series issue date for two consecutive valuation days and the determination agent gives the relevant notice; (iv) the Issuer will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, be required to make a payment in respect of VAT or be required to account for VAT in respect of a delivery of Metal from or to an authorised participant (whether or not such VAT is recoverable); (v) an Issuer Call Redemption Event occurs (as discussed further below under ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""); (vi) the Issuer becomes entitled to serve a VAT redemption event notice and the Trustee gives the relevant notice as directed by the requisite number of securityholders; or (vii) an event of default occurs under the ETC Securities. These include certain breaches by the Issuer of its obligations that are not cured within the applicable cure period and certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer. The Issuer may elect to redeem the ETC Securities early on giving not less than 30 calendar days' notice to securityholders (an ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""). The ETC Securities will rank equally amongst themselves. The rights of securityholders are limited in recourse to the Secured Property. As such, once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed, none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors, officers, members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and, therefore, the rights of securityholders will rank in accordance therewith. As a result of such provisions, the securityholders may not receive in full the final redemption amount or early redemption amount payable in respect of an ETC Security. All payments in respect of the ETC Securities shall be made net of and after allowance for any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes. In the event that any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes applies to payments in respect of the ETC Securities, securityholders will be subject to such tax or deduction and shall not be entitled to receive amounts to compensate for any such tax or deduction. No event of default will occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction. The ETC Securities will be governed by the laws of Ireland. There will be two security deeds relating to the ETC Securities; one will be governed by the laws of Ireland and the other will be governed by English law.

The ETC Securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") or under the securities law of any state or political sub-division of the United States of America or any of its territories, possessions or other areas subject to its jurisdiction including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Issuer has not been and will not be registered under any federal laws of the United States of America. The ETC Securities include ETC Securities in bearer form that are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. No person has registered nor will register as a commodity pool operator of the Issuer under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the ""CEA"") and the rules thereunder (the ""CFTC Rules"") of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the ""CFTC""). Any offer or sale of the ETC Securities must be made in an offshore transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Regulation S thereunder (""Regulation S""). The ETC Securities may not at any time be offered, sold or otherwise transferred in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, persons who are either (a) U.S. persons as defined in Regulation S or (b) persons who do not come within the definition of a non-United States person under CFTC Rule 4.7 (excluding for the purposes of subsection (d) thereof, the exception to the extent it would apply to persons who are not non-United States persons).

· The amount payable in respect of the ETC Securities is linked to the performance of the underlying Metal. Prices of precious metals are generally more volatile than prices in other asset classes.

• €20 million has been provided to the State Export-Import Bank of Ukraine (Ukreximbank) to help local businesses overcome challenges and disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine.
• The operation involves a parallel cross-currency swap made possible in collaboration with the Currency Exchange Fund (TCX). This approach supports long-term lending in Ukrainian hryvnia.
• The transaction benefits from a €2 million grant from the European Union, which makes it possible to offer more affordable loan conditions.

As part of EU efforts to aid economic recovery, the European Investment Bank (EIB, the EU bank) has disbursed €20 million to the State Export-Import Bank of Ukraine (Ukreximbank). This local-currency financing aims to support Ukrainian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and is the last tranche of a €300 million debt facility implemented by Ukreximbank.

The funds will be made available with the support of a parallel cross-currency swap in Ukrainian hryvnia and will be on-lent via Ukreximbank to improve SMEs’ resilience in wartime conditions, enabling them to continue their economic activities and meet the essential needs of the population.

The European Union is supporting this transaction with a €2 million grant, which will help improve the terms and conditions of the funding made available to SMEs. This EU contribution is a part of the European Union’s broader EU4Business initiative, which aims to foster SME growth by improving access to finance, providing business development services and promoting better business regulations.

The operation was made possible by the EIB’s investment in TCX, a development finance institution set up to protect borrowers in emerging and frontier markets from currency risk. TCX offers derivative instruments in emerging and frontier currencies that transform hard currency borrowing into fixed local-currency obligations.

EIB Vice-President Teresa Czerwińska, responsible for the Bank's operations in Ukraine, said: “In these extraordinarily challenging times, it’s crucial to enhance vital access to finance for war-affected SMEs, the backbone of the Ukrainian economy, to meet their business recovery needs and support the private sector. The EIB remains dedicated to ensuring Ukrainian SMEs have the support needed for the country’s recovery. We are grateful for the backing by the European Commission, our primary partner in this endeavour, and delighted to strengthen our cooperation with Ukreximbank.”

EU Ambassador to Ukraine Katarína Mathernová said: “This €20 million disbursement from the European Investment Bank, backed by a €2 million EU grant, is crucial for aiding Ukrainian SMEs affected by the war. SMEs are vital to the Ukrainian economy, and the European Union has been redirecting assistance to support them since the very first days of Russia’s full-scale war of aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine’s candidate country status creates new economic opportunities, and the European Union is committed to helping Ukraine seize them through initiatives such as EU4Business.”

CEO of TCX Ruurd Brouwer added: “We are grateful for the opportunity to support the EIB and the European Union in realising this transaction. Access to sustainable and predictable hryvnia funding is critical for the resilience of SME borrowers in Ukraine. Especially now.”

Member of the Management Board of Ukreximbank Oleksandr Schur said: “Today, Ukrainian businesses are undergoing a painful forced transformation. On one hand, European integration processes promise prospects for development in foreign markets and a significant reduction of barriers. On the other hand, a full-scale war has seriously impacted the country’s economy. The loan provided by the EIB signifies a successful partnership between Ukreximbank and the EU bank. We are grateful that the European Union and its bank, the EIB, continue to support us during these challenging times, as this partnership enables us to continue assisting Ukrainian small and medium-sized businesses, which have been the hardest hit by the war.”

The EIB and its subsidiary responsible for small and medium-sized businesses the European Investment Fund (EIF) — together the EIB Group — made over €1.6 billion available to support the Ukrainian private sector, particularly SMEs, through the credit lines and partial portfolio guarantees before the war.

The EIB Group (backed by the European Commission) is planning to launch an EU4Business Guarantee Facility in 2023 to support small and medium businesses in the Eastern Partnership countries, including Ukraine. The new facility will be implemented in partnership with local financial intermediaries and amounts to €40 million, €30 million of which is expected to be dedicated to Ukraine. The remainder will be made available to banks in Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The facility is expected to unlock €500 million in loans in the selected countries, including €375 million in Ukraine.

EIB Global is the EIB Group’s specialised arm devoted to increasing the impact of international partnerships and development finance outside the European Union. EIB Global is designed to foster strong, focused partnership within Team Europe and as part of the EU Global Gateway strategy, alongside fellow development finance institutions and civil society. EIB Global brings the Group closer to local people, companies and institutions through our offices across the world."

1142284125,20231124,"The recent flare-up of violence in Gaza has ignited a wave of reactions within the European Union (EU), revealing a stark division among member states. This divide reflects differing opinions on how to address the conflict and achieve a lasting resolution. Tensions on the ground have led to a multitude of perspectives, highlighting the complexity and sensitivity of the situation.

One school of thought among EU member states is that a stronger stance must be taken to condemn the violence and protect civilians in Gaza. These countries argue that the international community should hold all parties accountable for their actions, urging them to deescalate the situation and seek a diplomatic solution. They emphasize the importance of respecting human rights and the need to ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals affected by the conflict.

Conversely, there are member states within the EU who adopt a more nuanced perspective. These countries argue for a balanced approach, acknowledging the complexities and historical context that underpin the conflict. They believe that while condemning violence is essential, non-partisan mediation is crucial for long-term peace. These nations stress the importance of dialogue and negotiation, recognizing that sustainable solutions can only be achieved through a process that respects the rights and aspirations of all parties involved.

While the European Union as a whole aims to maintain a united front, the differing opinions on the Gaza conflict present a challenge. As a supranational institution, the EU strives to foster collaboration and consensus among member states. However, in cases where diverging interests and national histories come into play, finding common ground can be arduous.

Q: What is the Gaza conflict?

 A: The Gaza conflict refers to an ongoing political and territorial dispute between Israel and various Palestinian factions, primarily centered around the Gaza Strip.

Q: What are the differing perspectives within the European Union?

 A: Some EU member states advocate for a stronger condemnation of violence and the protection of civilians, while others emphasize the need for balanced dialogue and non-partisan mediation.

Q: How does the European Union address such divisions?

 A: The EU strives to foster collaboration and consensus among member states, but diverging interests and national histories can make finding common ground challenging."

1142290590,20231124,"The two chemicals in question – homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate – are ultraviolet light filters that are solely used as ingredients in sunscreens.

Animal testing was banned​ in Europe in March 2009, but there is a regulation based around worker exposure​ to certain chemicals in the EU’s REACH​ regulation, which can be at odds with the testing ban.

According to animal protection NGO Cruelty Free Europe (CFE), the toxicity testing of the two chemicals that's required by ECHA will involve over 5,500 animals, including rats, rabbits and fish, being force-fed the ingredients in tests before being killed and dissected.

Cruelty Free Europe member, Cruelty Free International, was allowed to intervene in the appeals on behalf of Symrise AG and said the decision “renders the European Union and United Kingdom bans on animal testing for cosmetics virtually meaningless.”​

The interplay between REACH and Cosmetics Regulation​

However, in response to Cruelty Free Europe’s comments, the ECHA has highlighted its position in terms of balancing the EU’s REACH worker safety regulation with Cosmetics Regulation.

It said: “The court has issued its judgment, and we welcome its outcome. It confirms how the European Commission and ECHA have interpreted the interplay between the current REACH and current Cosmetics Regulation.​

To make sure that workers are not at risk, REACH requires safety data on the properties of chemicals they handle, regardless of if substances are used for cosmetics. To protect the health of workers, animal testing may be required under REACH.​

REACH requires companies to use alternative methods whenever possible before conducting animal tests. ECHA promotes the use of alternative methods and plays a role in verifying if new animal testing proposed by companies is needed.​

Animal tests are only needed if there is no alternative way to demonstrate safe use of chemicals.”​

Symrise itself said it acknowledged the decision from the European Court of Justice regarding the cases T-655/20 and T-656/20. ""We appreciate that this brings clarity to the subject matter. It is a fundamentally important event for Symrise that the European Court of Justice has now decided on, ​which we of course respect,"" said a spokesperson for the company.

""Due to the complexity of the legal proceedings, we are currently unable to make any substantive statements. We will now perform a deeper analysis of the verdict to determine potential further actions.""​

The ruling against Symrise acknowledges that, under Article 25 of REACH, manufacturers should “generate information obtained by means other than animal testing ‘whenever possible’ and to undertake such testing ‘only as a last resort’” – therefore when there are no non-animal alternatives.

However, Cruelty Free Europe said that it believed that the General Court's decision has not aligned with this.

“In fact, the testing bans in the Cosmetics Regulation apply irrespective of whether there are alternatives,”​ the NGO said in a statement.

“The Court, wrongly in CFI’s view, sidestepped a provision in REACH which says that the REACH testing requirements apply ‘without prejudice’ to the cosmetics bans – in other words, those bans should take precedence. The ruling therefore turns on its head what EU citizens have been promised. The cosmetics bans were introduced before REACH – hence the need for the ‘without prejudice’ clause.”​

In 2018, the ECHA told Symrise AG that they were required to test these chemicals on animals.

The German chemicals company then undertook an initial appeal, which was held in 2021, but was dismissed by ECHA’s Board of Appeal. Symrise AG then took its case to the General Court.

Over 1.2 million people recently signing a ‘Save Cruelty Free Cosmetics’ European Citizens’ Initiative, which was launched in August 2021 by a coalition of European animal protection groups including Cruelty Free Europe.

In response to this demand, the European Commission said it would start to plan the total phase-out of animal testing for all chemicals.

Cruelty Free Europe’s Director of Science and Regulatory Affairs, Dr Emma Grange, said: “This decision is a huge backwards step in our fight to stop animals suffering and dying in the name of beauty. The existing bans, which have been in place in the UK for 25 years and European Union for two decades, are now virtually meaningless, as this case will set a damaging precedent in toxicity testing for cosmetics ingredients, even if they have been approved as safe for use for many years.”​

On the topic of animal testing for cosmetics, ​Cosmetics Design-Europe​ recently spoke to the CEO​ of Swedish life sciences company SenzaGen who said he believed that there is still plenty of unnecessary animal testing going on across the world.

The game-changing business has developed technology based on genomics and human tissue models, which it said has been shown to give more reliable results than testing on animals and could potentially be an alternative option for cosmetics companies."
1142290591,20231124,"Saturday 12th November: London streets are lined with people. Some are remembering the violence of the Second World War, others are demanding an end to violence in the Middle East, and a loud minority are instigating violence and chaos to “defend” the cenotaph, accusing riot police of favouring the “pro-Palestinian mob”. This minority included the likes of Tommy Robinson and other radical right-wingers, chanting “England till I die”. On the previous Friday, the then Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, wrote the piece which would lead to this violence and her descent. On Friday 11th, Suella Braverman, then Home Secretary, had written a piece in The Telegraph which accused the police of “playing favourites”, which eventually led to her downfall.

Mrs Braverman has been home secretary twice in the last year, once under Mrs Truss and then under Mr Sunak (PM); within both cabinets, she was known for her right-wing, brexiteering views, specifically pioneering the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda and, in recent days, suggesting that homelessness is a “lifestyle choice”, proposing that charities who provide tents to homeless people should be fined. The final blow to her time in cabinet was after she published an unapproved article written for the Times, where she claimed that Islamists were comparable to groups in Northern Ireland and that the police “play favourites”; she compared pro-Palestinian marches to ‘hate marches’, and consequently spurred on right-wing violence on Armistice day.

James Cleverly will take on Mrs Braverman’s muddy path; he faced the Supreme Court ruling on the Rwanda policy last Wednesday Morning, in which it rejected Mr Sunak’s plan to “stop the boats”. He also will deal with the laws around protests, in which Downing Street wants him to increase police powers to deal with protests, to make it easier to ban marches and persecute those glorifying terrorism. Sacking Mrs Braverman is unlikely to result in any dramatic policy change within the Home Office, but the cooling down of inflammatory rhetoric from within the Cabinet will undoubtedly give the appearance of a more moderate Government. James Cleverly, whilst more restrained in his media presence than Mrs Braverman, still holds the same Brexit views, fiercely supporting the Rwanda deportation policy. Thus, although the end of Mrs Braverman pleased Conservative moderates, the right-wing Conservatives remained strong.

The Conservative party is still not unified. There is the right-wing faction who remain fervently Euro-sceptic and are proposing to leave the European Convention of Human Rights in order to push the Rwanda Policy through. This faction will grate against the recent introduction of Lord David Cameron as the foreign secretary, who swiftly abandoned post when the nation voted to leave the European Union.

But by firing Suella Braverman, has Mr Sunak lost his right-wing populist appeal with these backbenchers? Mrs Braverman became a scapegoat of sorts, in which she could say things which gained support from the party’s right, without Mr Sunak saying it himself. The Prime Minister may have pre-emptively sacrificed his scapegoat, leaving him responsible for radical elements of the party. Posted on X, she accuses the Prime Minister of betraying the nation and their agreement, calling him “weak” and “indecisive”. Thus, this further displays how the Conservative Party has become entrenched in bureaucracy, deal after deal made with every new Prime Minister and every reshuffle. The Conservative Party has become lost in its own chaos. As displayed in her letter, Mrs Braverman seems to be planning on leading the charge of right-wing MPs, distancing herself from Mr Sunak in time for the next election.

Ultimately, the Prime Minister had distanced himself from the member of his party most liable to cause media disruption. In many senses, this will help normalise the Party’s image, but also risks drawing attention to other divisions."
1142297447,20231124,"The birthplace of the ‘Final Solution’ now takes protecting Jews and Israel as one of its bedrock principles.

The raid on Thursday, by 500 German police officers, of 16 properties suspected of housing Hamas sympathizers in the heartland of the former Third Reich is an endeavor to be a safe harbor for Jews.

Just this month, more than 70 properties across Germany suspected of housing Hamas and Hezbollah fellow travelers have been visited by law enforcement. The country’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, explains that “we are keeping a close eye on the Islamist scene. Islamists and antisemites cannot and must not feel safe anywhere here.”

The extraordinary raids demonstrate that even as the weeks since October 7 have seen an upsurge in antisemitism across Europe, Germany has chartered a different course. On the day of the attacks, the Brandenburg Gate was illuminated with the blue and white hues of the Israeli flag. On November 11, the anniversary of Kristallnacht, it assumed the same colors, along with the maxim, “Never Again Is Now.”

Beyond that gate, though, on the streets and at the Reichstag, a debate is raging over what Germany’s past means for its present responsibilities to the Jewish state, now embroiled in a war with Hamas. At stake is not only whether the European powerhouse supports Israel. Hanging in the balance is what it means to be German, seven decades after the Holocaust.

It is possible that no city outside of Israel has quite as many signs indicating points of Jewish interest as Berlin. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe sits beside the Tiergarten. The pavement is studded with Stolpersteine, or “stumbling stones,” indicating where Jews once lived. In 1933, there were 160,000 Jews at Berlin. In 1945, that total was 8,000.

Currently, there are about 11,000 Jews affiliated with Berlin’s Jewish community, though the true number is likely significantly higher. Some estimates have 10,000 Israelis alone living in the city. Among them are the director of the Maxim Gorki Theater, Yael Ronen, as well as the conductor of Berlin’s state opera, Daniel Barenboim. The Gorki describes one director, Sivan Ben Yishai, as the “new Jewish-Israeli star in the heavens of the German (art)world.”

What does Germany’s self-professed “special responsibility” for the Jews mean in an age when the Palestinians have become a cause célèbre for many young Europeans, especially those on the left? This correspondent saw such sentiments, in the form of graffiti, written on walls across some of Berlin’s hippest districts. There have been attacks on synagogues and Stars of David scrawled on Jewish homes.

What sets Germany apart is not these attacks — they are lamentably common across Europe — but the state’s response. Chancellor Scholz told lawmakers that “at this moment, there is only one place for Germany — the place at Israel’s side. Our own history, our responsibility arising from the Holocaust, makes it a perpetual task for us to stand up for the security of the state of Israel.”

The sentiment that Israel’s security is at the bedrock of German identity is captured in a neologism — Staatsräson, or “reason of state.” It was coined by Germany’s last chancellor, Angela Merkel, in a speech before the United Nations in 2007 and repeated the next year at the Knesset. In the last month, amidst a spate of antisemitic incidents, it has been endorsed by all of Germany’s governing parties as a foundational principle.

Mr. Scholz was the first European head of state to visit Israel after the attacks. During the visit, Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, reflected that “Germany is one of our biggest and closest allies.” The chancellor has tweeted a demand for the “immediate and unconditional release of all hostages” and reiterated that “Israel has the right and duty to defend itself.”

A contrast with the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, is instructive. While Mr. Macron also visited Israel in the days after October 7, he has since taken a less sympathetic stance. A conference he convened at Paris called for a ceasefire, despite Israel’s assertions that such a development would only help Hamas. He told the BBC that there was “no reason” and “no justification” for bombing “babies, ladies, and old people.”

Israel’s cause has found support beyond Mr. Scholz’s office. Berlin’s public prosecutor is on record that the chant “From the river to the sea Palestine will be free” will be prosecuted. Section 130 of the German penal code, which has been used to effectively ban public expressions of antisemitism, makes it a crime, punishable by up to five years in prison, to “incite hatred against segments of the population or calls for violent or arbitrary measures against them.”

Earlier this month, the interior minister, Ms. Faeser, announced a total ban on activity supportive of Hamas. At a press conference announcing the measures, Ms. Faeser explained that she has “completely banned the activities of a terrorist organization whose aim is to destroy the state of Israel.” That prompted Hamas’s representative in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, to accuse Germany of possessing a “Holocaust mentality.”

The Sun spoke to a press officer, Michael Pfalzgraf, for the right wing Alternative für Deutschland party, whose members are skeptical of the European Union and opposed to immigration. Its political fortunes have been rising nationally, not just in its formerly East German heartland.

Mr. Pfalzgraf cited an observation from an AfD federal spokesman, Tino Chrupalla, who told the party in a plenary session that “Israel is of course allowed to defend itself against attacks. The right to self-defense is provided for in international law. However, Israel must pay attention to proportionality. Humanitarian disasters must not occur. A conflagration in the Middle East must be prevented.”

One of the most sterling defenses of Israel to have emerged from the Old World comes from Germany’s vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, a member of the Green Party whose political commitments — firmly of the left — are a world away from Mr. Pfalzgraf’s.

In a viral video titled “On Israel and Antisemitism,” Mr. Habeck offers a rousing defense of the Jewish state. Staring into the camera, he declares that the “phrase ‘Israel’s security is part of Germany’s raison d’état’” — its Staatsräson — “has never been an empty phrase, and it must not become one. It means that Israel’s security is essential for us as a country.”

Mr. Habeck explains that it was the generation of his “grandparents that wanted to exterminate Jewish life in Germany and Europe” and that “after the Holocaust, the founding of Israel was the promise of protection to the Jews — and Germany is compelled to help ensure that this promise can be fulfilled.” He adds his concern “about the antisemitism in parts of the political left.”

The Wall Street Journal, in a laudatory editorial, notes that Mr. Habeck could serve as an example for “President Biden, who is struggling to suppress antisemitism in the Democratic Party.”"
1142299180,20231124,"In this episode of Witness, we head into the Gaza Strip to hear harrowing accounts of death, destruction and desperation from those living inside the besieged territory.

Israel continues its bombing campaign in Gaza night and day, in retaliation for the October 7 Hamas terror attack.

As of mid-November, Gaza health officials said that more than 14,000 people had been killed, including 5,600 children.

Ambulances and civilians rush to the scene, hoping to rescue who they can. A scene that repeats itself every day.

Residents of Gaza dig through the rubble of this destroyed building. They carry out those injured and those who didn’t make it.

""We thought we were the only ones hit, but we went outside the house and saw bodies on the ground that flew from over 40 metres from the Al-Ghoul family home,"" said Abu Ibrahim, a resident of the al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza.

""There were about seven girls, and some bodies and body parts were over the roof of a public market. Later, a fire caused by the airstrike set the bodies on fire.""

Into the night, injured Gazans continue to be rushed to hospitals. Inside, doctors and nurses frantically scrambled to save injured children and adults.

Israeli planes dropped millions of leaflets over Gaza City, urging residents to flee to the south a few days before the start of Israel's ground offensive on 27 October.

After entering Gaza, Israeli troops slowly and methodically began to encircle Gaza, completely cutting it off from the rest of the strip.

According to the United Nations, more than half of Gaza’s hospitals were forced to close since Israel declared war after its own civilians were murdered or taken hostage by Hamas.

Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip has meant that basic medicines and fuel to power generators are quickly running out. In the few hospitals that still operate, nurses, and doctors are overwhelmed.

""The health situation in the Gaza Strip has collapsed. We can't even describe it. Most of the hospitals are out of service or not working at all,"" said Dr Ahmad Moghrabi, the head of plastic surgery at Nasser Hospital.

Dr Moghrabi is the head of plastic surgery at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. His staff includes doctors from the international NGO, Doctors Without Borders.

Doctors face impossible decisions due to the lack of medical supplies. They must choose who to treat, and essentially, who gets to live.

The staff at Nasser Hospital have resorted to using vinegar and shampoo to disinfect wounds. They even perform some surgery without anaesthetics.

""We receive wounded people who are not a priority for surgery, but we don't have space in hospital beds, so we put them in corridors and on balconies until their turn for surgery comes. But the urgent cases, we try to treat them as soon as we can, but sometimes they are late being treated, and their situation becomes catastrophic,"" Dr Moghrabi told Euronews.

Each day, the Israeli army opens up one road for several hours to allow civilians to flee to the south.

Yet the road was not totally safe for the Al-Nimnim family. An Israeli strike hit the truck they were travelling in, killing 36 members of the family. Only three survived. The survivors are being treated in a tent provided by the European Union International Aid Agency at al-Aqsa Hospital.

""What have my children done to be torn to shreds? They became body parts, I found six of their bodies intact, while the rest were body parts in a plastic bag,"" said Nabeel al-Nimnim, a resident from the north of Gaza and a survivor of an Israeli attack.

With nearly half of Gaza damaged or destroyed, many had no choice but to flee south.

But others thought the evacuation road was too dangerous. Some decided not to abandon their homes. 81% of Gazans are in fact refugees and descendants of refugees who were displaced during wars with Israel.

""Where would we go?"" asked Abu Ibrahim, a resident of the al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza. ""There is no way to leave our houses. I won't leave, even if it means my death. This is my homeland, and I won't abandon it.""

Still by mid-November, the great majority of the one million Palestinians living in northern Gaza had safely fled south, according to Israel. Most were forced to walk, carrying what little they could on their back.

Even in so-called safe zones, civilians are not safe. On one block, at least 45 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on the Maghazi refugee camp on 5 November, according to Gaza health officials.

The Maghazi camp lies in the zone where Israel’s military had urged Palestinian civilians to seek refuge. An Israeli army spokesperson said he was checking whether Israeli forces were operating in the area.

Meanwhile, in the south of Gaza - overflowing with new refugees from the north - basic necessities such as bread, fuel, and water are in scant supply. Every day, people queue for hours, hoping to get what little they can.

""We lived with dignity in our homes. But we have been humiliated ever since we were displaced,"" cried one displaced Palestinian woman in the south of Gaza.

""Provide us with bread and repair the sewage systems in the schools. We are likely to contract diseases, and the coronavirus may affect our children. Have mercy on us!""

Refugees from the north of Gaza have set up new refugee camps further south. The tents offer little in the way of protection from the elements and the camp has no basic services - not even a toilet.

Only a trickle of aid now reaches Gaza. Each truck can only bring a small fraction of the supplies that are needed. On the Gazan side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, hundreds anxiously check the posted schedules - waiting for their chance to get out.

A limited number of foreign nationals have been allowed to leave Gaza. Many are stuck waiting. One such person is German national Katya Miess, who arrived one week before the war began to visit her Palestinian husband.

""People are suffering, they are crying. People are afraid. All day, every day, there are bombs and missiles,"" she told Euronews.

""People don't know where to go. We feel that we have been abandoned by our own country. We don't know what is going to happen. Every day, people fear for their lives. It's not normal.""

As Gaza’s health system disintegrates, ambulances carrying wounded Palestinians crossed into Egypt while the border was still open.

It is, however, not open for fuel coming into Gaza. The lack of this essential supply has limited the ability of hospitals to perform even basic services, putting many people, including premature babies, at risk.

""If the situation continues like this; in a few days, we won’t be able to carry on, we are going to witness massacres and crimes that history hasn't seen before,"" explained Dr Ahmad Moghrabi.

On 15 November, Israel's army took control of Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, claiming Hamas fighters use it as their main base.

By the time of our broadcast, Hamas’ command centre had not been found."
1142299183,20231124,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on Friday he supported Slovakia's request to continue exports of fuel produced from Russian oil to the Czech Republic beyond a Dec. 5 deadline.

Slovnaft, Slovakia's sole refiner, owned by Hungary's MOL, has sought to cut the share of Russian oil in its processing activities this year to about 60%, from about 95%.

The European Union has imposed sanctions on Russian crude, although Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary have exemptions while they shift to new sources. An exemption allowing Slovnaft to export its products produced from Russian oil to the Czech Republic is due to expire next month.

Slovakia is seeking a longer exemption. Without it, Slovnaft would lose exports to its neighbour and produce only for domestic markets, it says.

""We understand Slovakia needs time and therefore we are supporting this request by Slovakia,"" Fiala told a news conference after meeting Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Prague.

Fico said Slovakia was on a ""good path"" to getting the exemption extended.

Hungary said earlier this year it would also seek a one-year extension that will allow Slovnaft to export products made from Russian oil."
1142304191,20231124,"A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:

No evidence that DNA sequence used in shot leads to cancer and other health issues

CLAIM: Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine contains a DNA sequence called Simian Virus 40 that can cause health problems, including cancer.

THE FACTS: No evidence has been found to suggest DNA fragments used in the development of the coronavirus vaccine -- such as a portion of SV40’s DNA sequence -- are causing health problems in people who have received the COVID-19 vaccine. A recent congressional hearing r evived the baseless claim that coronavirus vaccines contain dangerous levels of monkey virus DNA. Following the hearing, social media users began sharing a post with information from The Epoch Times website that reported was warned at the hearing about “DNA fragments” detected in the inoculation made by and . The post cites testimony from Dr. , who played a role in developing the messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology used in the vaccine, claiming the shot includes a DNA sequence called Simian Virus 40, or SV40. “The sequence leaves behind residual DNA that could cause problems,” reads one Instagram post. But the hearing at the , which was held by Rep. and other vaccine critics in the , repeated long-debunked falsehoods about the contents of the shot and purported health risks like cancer. Government regulatory agencies and vaccine experts told The Associated Press that the Simian Virus itself isn’t present in the vaccine, and there’s no evidence anything contained in the vaccine could alter a person’s DNA or lead to cancer and other illnesses. The , which regulates vaccines in nations, explained that “non-functional” fragments of SV40’s DNA sequence are used as “starting material” in producing the vaccine. But they’re mostly being broken down and removed in the manufacturing process. Trace amounts might remain at “very low levels” in the final product, the agency and others acknowledged, but they are well within established safety guidelines.“ EMA has seen no evidence of an association between mRNA vaccines and adverse events that could be linked to the presence of DNA material, nor are we aware of any scientific evidence showing that the very small amounts of residual DNA that may be present in vaccine batches could integrate into the DNA of vaccinated individuals,” the -based agency wrote in an emailed statement. , which regulates vaccines in the , echoed the sentiment, saying no safety concerns about residual DNA in COVID vaccines have been identified, despite more than one billion shots being administered. “The FDA stands behind its findings of quality, safety, and efficacy for the mRNA vaccines,” the agency wrote, deferring further questions to and other vaccine makers. , in an emailed statement, stressed that the use of the SV40 sequence is common practice in developing vaccines, including the influenza and hepatitis shots that have been administered globally for decades. ”There is no evidence to support claims that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine contains plasmid DNA that could potentially impact a person’s DNA or be a theoretical cancer risk,” the company wrote, referring to DNA materials used to trigger an immune response during vaccine development. Spokespersons for The Epoch Times didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.

Newly released footage does not show a federal agent flashing his badge while undercover

CLAIM: Security camera footage from , shows a federal agent disguised as a supporter of then-President during the attack on the .

THE FACTS: The man in the video is not a federal agent. It's , a man who was sentenced in July to more than four years in federal prison for his role in the attack. Multiple images of Lyons at the , dressed as he is in the footage, appear in court documents. The false claim emerged after House Speaker on began releasing thousands of hours of footage from the insurrection. Social media users — including members of — seized on a clip saying it proved that undercover federal agents participated in the riot. The video, which is 5 minutes and 31 seconds long, shows rioters and law enforcement personnel moving through a hallway in the . At 21 seconds into the video, a man appears from behind a column wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat, a camouflage scarf covering most of his face, and a dark blue sweatshirt layered over a green sweatshirt. He walks toward the camera, flashing his palms at the 36-second mark with a small object in his right hand. “And that ladies and gentlemen is a badge… with a red hat and fully disguised,” reads one post on X that shared a screenshot of the footage paused as Lyons is flashing his palms. But these claims play on enduring conspiracytheories about federal agents orchestrating the events of . Lyons was sentenced on to 51 months in federal prison for the part he played in the riot. Court documents include multiple images of Lyons inside the , dressed in the same outfit as in the security footage. For example, one shows Lyons recording himself in a mirror in the office of then-Speaker . In another, he sits in a car holding a framed photograph from Pelosi’s office, which shows her with the late Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights movement icon who died in . It is unclear exactly what Lyons is holding in his right hand when he flashes his palms. Lyons was convicted in April of six charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding. In addition to prison time, he was ordered to pay in restitution to the Architect of the and complete 36 months of supervised release. Johnson on Friday publicly released about 90 hours of security footage from the attack. An additional 44,000 hours is expected to be posted online over the next several months, the AP has reported.

THE FACTS: The video shows the soldiers raising the country’s flag over a -operated school in the city, not the hospital, a U.N. agency spokesperson confirmed. But posts online misrepresent the footage,,saying the video was taken at Gaza’s largest hospital, which became a focal point in the latest conflict between and this month. In the video, three soldiers walk along a flat rooftop carrying a flagpole bearing the Israeli flag and its distinctive Star of David, along with another purple and white flag. The group, dressed in heavy military gear, silently affixes the pole to a short column along the edge of the roof before quickly walking away. “They set up their flag on top of the Al Shifa Hospital To congratulate themselves on “conquering” a place filled with premature babies, injured kids and dead woman,” the text on the brief clip reads. But the flag wasn’t raised at — which raided last week, claiming it hid a command center for — but at a school elsewhere in the city. , a spokesperson for the U.N.’s in the Near East, confirmed in an email Tuesday that the building shown in the video houses one of its schools in the -controlled . Indeed, at one point in the video, the three soldiers step over the letters “UN” written in large dark-colored capital letters on the rooftop floor. But Touma declined to say which of the more than 180 schools the agency operates in the is shown in the video. She also said it was unclear when the flag was raised or whether or not it’s still there. “This is what we have for now and we don’t have more details,” Touma wrote. Spokespersons for the Israeli government and military didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. But the video appears to have been taken from the roof of a school building at the intersection of and Al-Naser roads, which is located about one mile from the hospital. Satellite imagery on Google Earth shows the letters “UN” painted on the long flat roof of one building, and matches several distinctly-styled structures that are shown in the video surrounding the campus complex that includes at least four schools for boys. For example, at the beginning of the clip, a tower with a red roof and a tall antenna on top can be seen in the upper left of the clip. That matches a building a block away on the map. Another building in front of the soldiers as they plant the flag has a unique curved facade and window on the top level, which is also visible in the satellite image. It’s unclear who first shared the video, but Israeli journalist Hallel shared a longer, clearer version of the footage on his social media accounts on . Rosen, who didn’t respond to emails seeking comment, described the clip in a post written in Hebrew as showing soldiers from the Israeli military’s raising a flag atop a school. The is composed of infantry units and has a purple and white flag similar to the one flown along with the Israeli flag in the video.

CLAIM: A video clip shows President “abruptly” leaving this year’s turkey pardoning ceremony at the .

THE FACTS: In the full video of Monday’s ceremony, Biden spends several minutes speaking and taking photos with guests after pardoning two turkeys in an address before hundreds of attendees. He can be seen waving to the crowd, plus giving a thumbs up and a salute, before leaving the event. But in the edited clip he leaves abruptly after the pardoning, turning away from the crowd and breaking into a light jog for a few moments before slowing to a walk as he makes his way to the . Two standing in front of the door part to let him through and salute as he goes inside. “Biden abruptly leaves his turkey pardon ceremony and half-jogs back inside,” reads one post on X, formerly Twitter. In the full video from the ceremony, Biden makes a more prolonged departure from the South Lawn of the . Immediately after pardoning two turkeys, named Liberty and Bell, Biden can be seen speaking with , chairman of the , and , vice president of . Biden then speaks for several minutes with some of the hundreds of guests and p oses for photos. Finally, standing next to his granddaughter, , the president waves to the crowd, giving a thumbs up and a salute, before making his exit. The tradition of pardoning turkeys dates back to 1947 when the , which represents turkey farmers and producers, first presented a National Turkey to President .

1142312891,20231124,"The Data Act — a contentious piece of European Union legislation that includes a clause requiring the ability to terminate smart contracts — has been approved by the European Parliament. If introduced, the legislation will require a smart contract to have a “kill switch.”

In a Nov. 9 press release, the parliament announced that the legislation was passed with 481 votes in favor and 31 against. The next step for it to become law is to gain the approval of the European Council.

In its current form, the Data Act stipulates that smart contracts must have the capability to be “interrupted and terminated,” and it mandates controls that allow for the resetting or halting of the contract. The stipulation appears to be a significant departure from the blockchain’s foundational ethos of decentralization.

How such kill switches would be implemented, and how they could impact the development and use of smart contracts remains unclear. Scott McKinney and Laura De Boel, attorneys with Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, told Cointelegraph that such a kill switch is “fundamentally incompatible with what a smart contract is” and how it’s viewed.

They added that the definition of a smart contract included in the Data Act is “overbroad” and likely to encompass computer programs that wouldn’t currently be considered a smart contract. They added:

Given the EU’s requirements — including the kill switch and data archiving obligations — they suggested that many companies entering applicable data sharing agreements “will simply decide not to use smart contracts in their applications.”

Gracy Chen, managing director at cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, told Cointelegraph that the implementation of such a kill switch “introduces a centralized element,” which may “erode trust in smart contracts, as users may beware of relying on contracts that external entities could potentially modify or shut down.”

As the EU moves closer to potentially cementing a smart contract kill switch into law, it’s unclear how it would enforce its application.

Implementing and regulating such a mechanism would, according to Wirex co-founder and CEO Pavel Matveev, see smart contract deployers “self-assess compliance with essential requirements and issue an EU declaration of conformity.”

Matveev told Coinelegraph that the Data Act’s definition of smart contracts is “expansive and lacks precision regarding the circumstances under which interruptions or terminations should be initiated.”

McKinney and De Boel believe the regulation could hinder blockchain innovation in the EU as its requirements are “quite strict, and vendors will need to go through potentially burdensome conformity assessments.”

Not everything is a negative, however, as the attorneys noted the Data Act provides “that European standardization organizations will be requested to draft harmonized standards for smart contracts.” They added:

Arina Dudko, head of corporate payment solutions for cryptocurrency exchange Cex.io, told Cointelegraph that as regulatory oversight of crypto companies builds, many have “settled on a system of transparency and detailed reporting.” That system has seen them adhere to applicable directives.

Dudko further compared the development of rules around blockchain tech to safety and standards rules for automobiles. When cars first hit roads, seatbelts weren’t mandatory, safety standards varied wildly, and when regulations were eventually introduced, “some vehemently fought progress in safety standards before they became accepted practice.”

Over time, she said, regulations surrounding these safety standards saved lives and led to safer roads. She likened these advances to the EU’s Data Act, saying it’s been facing a “similar phase of reactionary blowback.”

Dudko said that much like “emergency exits and fire codes, these accommodations are critical to ensuring the environments and products we share are safe for all.” Crypto market participants, she said, need a way to escape if they “get locked into a nefarious or misguided commitment.”

The debate on how the EU’s Data Act will impact the industry is ongoing, with some suggesting it could lead to a retreat or even hinder adoption.

Several provisions could hinder smart contract adoption in Europe, including geo-fencing services to maintain regulatory compliance.

According to Dudko, there’s an “unfortunate aversion to regulation in some offshoots of the crypto ecosystem that runs antithetical to the industry’s founding principles,” but to her, regulation is only a hindrance to those “with limited vision.”

Dudko argued that the Bitcoin (BTC) genesis block reference to the 2008 financial crisis was an “explicit mention” of the “pallid response” to the crisis, which was itself “the product of lax oversight.” She added:

Chen said that the kill switch could “impose additional compliance requirements on developers,” which could lead to delays and increased costs when deploying smart contracts.

On top of that, the effectiveness and functionality of these smart contracts could suffer due to strict data obligations. Chen added, “The enforceability of smart contracts heavily relies on their autonomous and self-executing nature, and any intervention or interference by third parties poses a risk to their integrity.”

While the EU’s new regulatory landscape poses some significant challenges for businesses employing smart contracts, it provides an imperfect but visible set of rules that isn’t present in many jurisdictions.

In the United States, regulators have been accused of regulation by enforcement after suing various crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken and Binance. To this day, the very definition of cryptocurrency differs between different U.S. financial watchdog agencies.

Chen said that the EU is “generally more cautious and regulation-focused” than other major economies, while McKinney and De Boel said Europe is “typically at the forefront when it comes to regulating data-driven industries.”

In contrast, they said that the U.S. doesn’t have a federal smart contracts law and has “relatively few state laws regarding smart contracts, most of which simply clarify that a smart contract can be a valid, binding contract.“

Recent: Bitcoin supercycle 2024: Is this the cycle to end them all?

Dudko said the EU has led with “common sense regulations that speak to the public’s broad understanding and usage of digital currencies,” adding that “the U.S. and United Kingdom place “greater emphasis on asset classification and promotional messaging respectively,” while the EU is “continuing to set standards around procedure and project functionality.”

While the Data Act is progressing, it is still yet to be passed into law, meaning the blockchain industry still has time to prepare. The industry will only know the true scope of the law once it has come into effect."
1142312897,20231124,"Day 639 of the invasion of Ukraine. Summary of key events in the last 24 hours:
• Ukraine is strengthening its air defenses ahead of winter
• There is a high probability that the EU will postpone the start of membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova
• Four killed in Russian shelling in Kherson region. Attacks against Avdiivka as well
• Finland left only one working checkpoint on the border with Russia
• A Russian court fined Google for information about the war in Ukraine
• Ukrinform: Fifty-five UN countries signed a declaration on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor
• The Kremlin said NATO's desire for a ""military Schengen"" was raising tensions



Ukraine is strengthening its air defenses ahead of winter

Ukraine is strengthening its air defense because of fears that Russia will continue to attack key energy sites in the country this winter. Moscow's goal is to cause discontent among the population of Ukraine and thereby increase pressure on the authorities in Kyiv to negotiate an end to the war on Moscow's terms.

Germany will provide Ukraine with another ""Patriot"" air defense system, reports the Ukrinform agency, citing the German ambassador in Kyiv. It will be in addition to the IRIS-T systems, which will also protect Ukraine from Russian airstrikes.

Today in the afternoon, the Russian occupation forces launched a new missile attack, the Air Force Command of Ukraine announced. An air alert was declared in five areas.

There is a high probability that the EU will postpone the start of membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova

There is a high probability that the EU will be forced to postpone the start of membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, Politico reports, citing diplomatic sources in Brussels.

The reason for this is Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Two days ago it became clear that he had sent a letter to the President of the European Council, Charles Michel. In it, Orbán calls for a debate on the EU's policy towards Ukraine and warns that in order for it to take place, his country is prepared to veto decisions that require unanimity. Such is the case with EU enlargement.

Yesterday it was understood that Charles Michel will visit Hungary on Monday. He will try to reach an agreement with Orbán so that the European Council in December does not fail. It is then that the leaders of the member states must decide on the negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova.

Four killed in Russian shelling in Kherson region. Attacks against Avdiivka as well

The Ukrainian army reported four killed in Russian shelling in the Kherson region, Reuters reported.

Russian attacks against the devastated city of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine also continue.

According to the head of Avdiivka's military administration, the Russian army launched the ""fierceest"" attacks on the city, which has fewer than 1,400 people left. Before the war, its population was about 32,000.

Meanwhile, early this morning, Russia's air defense system shot down 13 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and another three over the Volgograd region, the Russian Defense Ministry said.

Finland left only one working checkpoint on the border with Russia

Finland temporarily closed seven of eight border crossings along its border with Russia on Friday to protect against an unusually high influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa, Reuters reported.

More than 700 migrants from countries such as Yemen, Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria have entered Finland via Russia in the past few weeks. Helsinki claims Moscow is directing them to its border, a charge the Kremlin has denied.

After closing four of its biggest and busiest border crossings last week, Finland overnight closed three more crossings, leaving only the northernmost, Raja-Jooseppi, which is located in the Arctic region. The seven border points will not work for a month.

The operational border crossing will accept asylum applications from migrants for four hours a day, the Finnish border guard said, adding that no migrants had arrived at the crossing overnight.

The Border Guard is stepping up patrols along its 1,340-kilometer border with Russia.

It will receive additional resources for the task from the European Union's border agency Frontex, which said on Thursday it was sending 50 border guards and other personnel to help along with equipment such as patrol cars to step up control activities.

A correspondent for Russia's state television network Rossiya-24 has died after being injured in an attack by a Ukrainian drone, Russian state television announced, as quoted by Reuters. The information has not been commented on or confirmed by the Ukrainian authorities.

A day earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry released information that Maksudov was working in the occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region with other Russian correspondents when a Ukrainian drone was believed to have struck the area. Then the ministry announced that Maksudov's injuries were not life-threatening.

Zaporizhzhia Oblast is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.

On state television, Russian TV host Vladimir Solovyov commented on Maksudov's death, claiming he was killed while working on a story about Ukraine's alleged shelling of civilians. Solovyov is known for his threats against the West, and especially for his statement that Russia should use nuclear weapons.

Meanwhile, regional Ukrainian authorities reported early on November 23 that three civilians had been killed and four wounded in Russian attacks in the past 24 hours.

Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported that from February 2022 to June 2023, 63 journalists from 14 countries were killed by Russian forces.

According to the chairman of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, Serhiy Tomilenko, Russia is currently holding at least 25 Ukrainian journalists in prison.

A Russian court fined Google for information about the war in Ukraine

A Russian court has fined Alphabet, the parent company of Google, 4 million rubles (,582) for refusing to remove information about the war in Ukraine that Moscow has labeled ""fake news."" reported Reuters, citing the Russian news agency RIA.

This is yet another clash between Russia and a foreign technology company over content, data, censorship or local representation, according to Reuters. Disputes deepened and heated up especially after the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Ukrinform: Fifty-five UN countries signed a declaration on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor

Fifty-five UN member states signed the Ukraine-initiated Declaration on the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor (1932-1933) in Ukraine, Ukrinform reported.

According to the correspondent of the Ukrainian agency in New York, the document emphasizes that ""the Holodomor is a national tragedy of the Ukrainian people, which took the lives of millions of innocent people and was caused by the cruel actions and policies of the totalitarian regime.""

""The tragedy of the Holodomor should be a reminder to current and future generations of the need to unconditionally respect human rights, including the right to life, to prevent the recurrence of similar tragedies, as well as to prevent the use of starvation of civilians as a method for waging war, particularly by disrupting production and supply chains, which increases global food insecurity, especially for the most vulnerable,"" the statement said.

The document calls for honoring the memory of the victims of the Holodomor, ""a deadly man-made famine that claimed the lives of millions of Ukrainians, including persons of other nationalities who lived in Ukraine at the time,"" condemning the brutal policies carried out by Stalin's regime, reaffirms the commitment of all Member States to accelerate action to end hunger, as set out in the declaration approved by the UN General Assembly in September 2023.

The declaration was signed by the countries of the European Union, Azerbaijan, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Guatemala, Chile, Japan, South Korea, Great Britain, the United States, Uruguay, Costa Rica, the Marshall Islands and Palau.

The Kremlin said NATO's desire for a ""military Schengen"" was raising tensions

NATO's desire to have a military analogue of the Schengen area in Europe to allow free passage of troops through the territory of the alliance's member states has raised tensions and is a cause for concern, the Kremlin said today.

NATO Logistics Command (JSEC) chief Lt. Gen. Alexander Zollfrank said in an interview with Reuters published yesterday that he would like to see such a zone. He expressed concern about too many red tape across Europe hampering the movement of army units, a problem that would cause a significant delay in the event of a conflict with Russia.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would retaliate if the proposal became a reality, Reuters reported.

1142312903,20231124,"More than 3,500 Ghanaians who left the country in search of greener pastures have been assisted to voluntarily return home since 2017; data from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Ghana has shown.

Of the figure, over 3,200 are males with the rest comprising; women and children, while the majority of the adults fall between the age range of 18 and 30 years.

The data, made available to the Ghanaian Times in an exclusive interview, shows that they returned from more than 30 European and African countries primarily Libya, Niger, Burkina Faso, Morocco and Algeria.

Their arrival was facilitated under the European Union (EU) -IOM Joint Initiative (JI) for Migrant Protection and Reintegration Programme in collaboration with government agencies.

Last year, 1,050 returnees arrived via chartered flights and as of October this year, 460 followed with more expected to join them later.

Commenting on the development, a Reintegration Assistant of IOM Ghana, Victoria Adomako said beyond the data more people have been supported to return home under other voluntary programmes.

She said Bono towns including Techiman, and others in Bono East Region, witnessed a substantial influx of returnees, followed by Ashanti where returnees went to towns like Aboaso, Mamponten, Ejura, and Aboabo.

In Greater Accra, she said areas like Nima, Ashaiman, and Madina and Kasoa in the Central Region experience significant numbers of returning individuals while there are increasing returns to the Northern and Western parts of the country.

She said the returned who often reach out to IOM in their countries of destination come home due to unfulfilled dreams, conflicts and other factors which had left a diverse impact on them, including trauma and regret.

""For returns from JIs, we have a lot of Ghanaians returning with mental issues because of the trauma they have been through in their migration journeys. We have trained clinical psychologists and therapists who provide services to them,"" she said.

Ms Adomako explained that under the IOM's comprehensive initiatives, pre-departure counseling, economic, social, and psychosocial support were provided and they are equipped with the necessary tools for successful reintegration, including skill development, education for children, and social support.

She said the IOM had partnerships with state agencies Youth Employment Authority, and the Ghana Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Commission who help to support the returnees to set up in the agriculture, trade and other areas depending on their interests and skills acquired during their sojourn.

""We give social support and education for the children and minors,"" she said.

On challenges, Ms Adomako mentioned the stigmatisation of returnees and obstacles in accessing healthcare after they arrive home; the absence of a common platform for data effective policy implementation and decision-making.

She advocated a comprehensive government involvement, while skills development and entrepreneurship drive should be increased to address unemployment, one of the key reasons for the migration.

For his part, an IOM Ghana Reintegration and Community Outreach Assistant, Collins Yeboah said some of the returnees travel using regular channels, but overstayed and ended up in irregular situations.

He said the IOM Ghana had intensified awareness creation at Schools and in communities while it had created an information portal (IOM X/Waka Well) to provide accurate travel information to the public.

He said IOM was not against migration because it had socio-economic benefits, but it would encourage the public to embark on safe and orderly migration."
1142312922,20231124,"The European Union and Turkey engaged in discussions centered on potential travel facilitation for Turkish citizens during a meeting held in Brussels. Following talks between EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson and Turkey's Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya, both sides expressed interest in exploring avenues to expedite visa issuance for Turkish citizens as an interim measure until visa requirements are lifted.

A joint statement highlighted their commitment to meeting benchmarks outlined in the Visa Liberalization Dialogue, emphasizing a shared determination to intensify efforts toward this goal. The acceleration of visa issuance stands as a temporary solution until the visa requirement is entirely lifted.

Migration and security were key topics, with discussions revolving around strategies to prevent irregular migration, bolster border security, and combat migrant smuggling. Both parties agreed to enhance collaboration and concerted efforts in counterterrorism and the fight against organized crime."
1142314603,20231124,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has written a letter to Brussels threatening to use his veto power to block EU funding for Ukraine and the accession process to admit the country into the bloc, demanding a “fundamental debate” about the bloc’s strategy on the war.

With European Union funding for Ukraine set to dry up at the end of the year and expansionist Eurocrats seeking to swiftly incorporate the partially-occupied state into their ranks, Brussels’ grand plans may be derailed by Budapest, with conservative leader Viktor Orbán vowing to not only block further military aid but also Ukraine’s ascension process unless the EU actually grapples with the realities on the ground.

In his letter addressed to European Council President Charles Michel and other national leaders, the Hungarian PM said that continued funding and admitting Ukraine into the EU was based on the premise that the West’s strategy in the proxy war against Russia was successful. However, Orbán, according to German news magazine Der Spiegel, noted that Kyiv’s “Spring” counteroffensive has mostly failed, with the lines of combat remaining static.

Ukraine’s failure to recapture its territory from the Russians should spark a “fundamental debate” about Europe’s strategy going forward, he argued.

In total, the European Union has provided 85 billion euros ($93bn/£74bn) in aid to Ukraine since the invasion nearly 21 months ago. However, funding is only guaranteed until the end of the year, meaning that Orbán’s threat of a veto is likely to cause panic in Brussels. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for another round of 50 billion euros in funding. Ukraine would further stand to benefit from €186 Billion should it be accepted into the European Union.

In a speech this week, Orbán warned that the mood of the American public is turning against continued funding of the war in Ukraine and that if Republicans come into power in Washington next year, Europe could be left holding the bag and forced to finance the conflict alone. “Europe is getting poorer, it doesn’t have the money for such a big crisis,” the prime minister noted.

Throughout the war in Ukraine, Prime Minister Orbán has been one of the few leaders in Europe to consistently call for peace negotiations to end the conflict, and has been harshly criticised for the stance.

The Hungarian leader has also queried the notion of accepting Ukraine into the European Union, saying that many questions remain about the practicality of such a move. Principally, Orbán has questioned what it would mean for the EU to absorb a country actively at war.

Although the bloc does not have a common defence pact like the NATO military alliance, it remains to be seen if a future border dispute between Russia and Ukraine would force other European powers to join in the fight against Moscow and potentially trigger a third World War.

A summit has been planned for December 14th and 15th on the topic of Ukraine’s ascension. However, this process can only go forward if all member states agree, with each country having the right to veto proceedings. In addition to holding the power to block Ukraine’s admission into the EU, Orbán also holds a similar veto over Ukraine’s aspirations of joining NATO.

In addition to raising questions about the idea of admitting a country currently at war, the Hungarian leader has also expressed concerns about the rampant corruption in Ukraine, which falls afoul of the EU’s standards for member states. Issues surrounding the alleged violations of the rights of ethnic Hungarians within Ukraine have long been a bone of contention between the two countries as well.

Eurocrats in Brussels have been far more enthusiastic about the prospect of expanding their influence through the admission of Ukraine, with Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen proclaiming that they are following the “call of history“. Meanwhile, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola has suggested that Ukraine should be given special dispensation to avoid the typically lengthy process and be allowed to enter the union on an accelerated time frame."
1142317298,20231117,"Russia must stop sending illegal migrants to its frontier with Finland in what amounts to a ""hybrid attack"", Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Friday, after the Nordic nation temporarily shut all border passenger crossings bar one.

More than 800 migrants from nations including Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen have entered Finland via Russia in recent weeks, an increase from less than one per day previously, according to the Finnish Border Guard. Helsinki says Moscow is funnelling them to the border in retaliation for its decision to increase defence cooperation with the United States, a charge the Kremlin denies. Finland infuriated Russia earlier this year when it joined NATO, ending decades of military non-alignment, due to the war in Ukraine.

""We want to send a clear message to Russia: this must stop,"" Orpo told a press conference. ""It is not at this moment a question of asylum seekers, it is a question of hybrid attack and national security,"" he said.

Having shut four border stations last week, Finland closed three more overnight for a month, leaving open only its northernmost one, Raja-Jooseppi, located in the Arctic region. Raja-Jooseppi opened its gates for traffic at 0800 GMT on Friday and stayed open for four hours, the Border Guard said.

However Finland's ombudsman for non-discrimination said the remote location of Raja-Jooseppi prompted concerns that Helsinki was jeopardising the right to seek asylum. ""If there is no genuine and effective access to the asylum procedure, there is an obvious danger of violating the absolute ban on return and the ban on mass deportation,"" the ombudsman's office said in a post on social media platform X.

The Finnish Border Guard said 92 migrants had arrived at the Salla and Vartius border crossings on Thursday before they shut but none had turned up overnight outside opening hours. EU HELP

It expects dozens of officers from the European Union's Frontex border agency to help patrol the 1,340 km (833 mile) border with Russia from next week. ""Their task will primarily be to patrol the land border under the supervision of the Finnish Border Guards and to support them,"" Border Security Expert Arttu Maaranen told Reuters.

He said the border guards were preparing for all scenarios, including one in which migrants attempted to cross into Finland through forests spanning the frontier. ""We have requested equipment needed for monitoring and surveillance, including a thermal camera vehicle,"" he said.

Frontex already has nine border guard officers working in Finland. It said on Thursday it would deploy another 50 border guard officers and other staff to Finland along with equipment such as patrol cars to improve security. Norway has experienced ""no irregularities"" so far on its border with Russia, which runs to the north of Finland's, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said on Friday during a visit to the Estonian capital Tallinn.

Measured in current US dollars, exports and imports fell by 1.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively, with notable slowdowns in East Asia and Europe.

In the European Union, merchandise exports decreased by 1.5 per cent, with Germany and France experiencing even steeper declines of over 2 per cent. Similarly, East Asia witnessed a downturn in trade, with China experiencing a significant 6.1 per cent drop in exports and a 3.5 per cent decrease in imports, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in a press release.

In Q3 2023, the G20 observed a continued decline in merchandise trade, with exports and imports falling by 1.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively. The European Union, Germany, and France experienced significant drops in exports, notably in machinery, while East Asia, particularly China, saw a major decrease in both exports and imports.

Japan's exports saw a marginal decline of 0.7 per cent, while South Korea reported a contrasting trend with a 1.2 per cent increase, buoyed by strong automobile sales. However, both countries faced a reduction in imports, particularly in energy products. Australia and Indonesia also faced challenges, with lower sales of primary commodities impacting their export figures.

In a contrasting trend, North America, particularly the US, defied the overall global pattern by recording a rebound in exports. This upswing was primarily driven by robust trade in energy sector, highlighting a divergent economic trajectory compared to other major regions."
1142324378,20231124,"Thomas Schaefer, Volkswagen's CEO of the VW Passenger Cars Brand speaks with Reuters about the future of VW production in Africa, in Johannesburg, South Africa, November 24, 2023. REUTERS/Sumaya Hisham

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A senior Volkswagen executive involved in a global cost-cutting strategy said on Friday he was ""very worried"" about the future of the company's operations in South Africa, which is fighting persistent power cuts and logistics snarls.

The company's VW passenger car brand is in the midst of defining the key measures of a global scheme to boost its flagging margin - the first of a series of savings drives aimed at improving group profitability and staying competitive in the transition to electric cars.

The German automaker has been in South Africa for nearly 80 years. Factors like competitive labour costs once placed it among the company's higher-ranking bases globally, VW brand chief Thomas Schaefer said during a visit to the country.

But the costs of mitigating power outages caused by chronic production shortfalls at state-owned utility Eskom as well as rising labour costs and logjams on railways and at ports have eroded that advantage, he said.

""Eventually you have to say, why are we building cars in a less competitive factory somewhere far away from the real market where the consumption is?"" Schaefer said. ""I'm very worried about it ... We're not in the business of charity.""

He said the company's team in South Africa had done what it could to overcome what he called an ""uphill battle"" but that ultimately the South African government needed to step up to solve the problems.

Volkswagen produced some 132,200 Polo and Vivo models at its South African facility in Uitenhage last year, most of them for export.

Those export markets now risk disappearing, however, as wealthy countries move to electric vehicles (EVs).

The European Union and Britain are planning to ban sales of new internal combustion vehicles from 2035.

Schaefer said there were no current plans to introduce EV manufacturing in South Africa, since electric cars are currently priced out of the reach of most domestic consumers. Producing them for export would not be environmentally sustainable, he said.

With the proper government policies aimed at leveraging the country's proximity to critical minerals like lithium and cobalt, however, it could become a battery manufacturing hub, he said.

""There's a realistic chance that South Africa, with enough focus, with all the raw materials in the neighbourhood, they could be a champion,"" Schaefer said."

1142346909,20231124,"(MENAFN- Pajhwok Afghan News) ATLANTA (Pajhwok): To enhance Afghanistan's healthcare system and combat infectious diseases, the European Union (EU) has pledged €10 million to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The funding will improve preparedness and response systems for future disease outbreaks as well as health and nutrition emergencies. The EU office in Kabul said in a statement on Thursday 23 November 2023.

The long-lasting cooperation between the EU and WHO has contributed to stronger and more resilient health care in Afghanistan.

The aim of the latest funding is to further improve health care in all 34 provinces, which will benefit more than 2 million people. The additional funding builds on the earlier EU-WHO partnership in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by integrating and expanding diagnostic and infectious disease management and response in Afghanistan. EU said.

On launching the additional funding support to WHO, Ms Raffaella Iodice, EU Chargée d'Affaires a.i. to Afghanistan, said:“The EU is deeply committed to protecting Afghans from disease outbreaks and other health and nutrition emergencies. Building on our ongoing cooperation with WHO in Afghanistan, the new funding helps to strengthen public health across the country and ensure the well-being of Afghans.”

Dr Luo Dapeng, WHO Representative in Afghanistan, expressed gratitude for the EU support:“This funding will greatly contribute to reduce the burden of infectious diseases among the people of Afghanistan.

1142364078,20231124,"Electronic visas have been hailed across the world as a solution that increases efficiency and security. But according to new research, an overwhelming majority of e-visa systems do not take advantage of technologies like biometric matching, document scanning and validation, watchlist comparison, or even e-visa management. Instead, most e-visas systems are little more than an online visa application portal and do little to help the work of immigration authorities, an analysis from Travizory Border Security has revealed.

The Swiss border technology company analyzed visa systems of 75 countries across Latin America, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.

The research found that almost all (96 percent) countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region rely on manual visa processing. No end-to-end e-visa system exists in the region.

Travelers are still required to print out their electronic visas and present them to border authorities in India as well as in the vast majority of African countries that implemented e-visas, including South Africa. Many other countries were found to still rely on stickers and stamps.

Travizory Border Security, which makes end-to-end e-visa systems, argues that governments are missing out on the full benefits of digital visas. End-to-end systems can eliminate paperwork and replace it with digital travel credentials (DTC) linked to passports and relying on biometrics, reducing the risk of falsified or tampered visas, the company says.

“It is clear that governments are recognizing the significant benefits that come with digitalization and Travizory stands ready to support countries on their journey,” Jorge Ramirez, managing director for Americas at Travizory Border Security. “It is unfortunate that so many great destinations are reliant on half-baked systems that only digitize the visa application and don’t go far enough to fully transform the end-to-end visa process.”

One of the largest projects for introducing e-visas is the European Union’s Visa Information System (VIS) platform which will require the collection of fingerprint and face biometrics for first-time applicants. Last week, the European Council voted to adopt regulations on the system which may become available as early as 2025."

1142359297,20231124,"SHAFAQNA PAKISTAN | by Arsal Mir- In one of its reports, the European Union has mentioned human rights violations in Pakistan and restrictions on the media, which is being welcomed in many circles in Pakistan.

The fourth GSP report by the European Union has revealed that the situation in Pakistan regarding human rights, freedom of expression and civil society is the same as it was in 2020. Many circles are positive on this report, while some are also expressing concern over it.

The joint report by the European Commission and the European External Action Service, released on Tuesday, acknowledged that some progress had been made on measures on women, transgender children and the environment. However, in many other cases the situation is not promising.

The report revealed that several journalists were violently attacked and disappeared. There was also online trolling against critics, leading many journalists to opt for self-censorship to protect themselves. Coercive methods were also used against human rights activists, political activists and elected representatives, limiting their freedoms and using administrative, legal and other means to restrict freedoms.

The report recommends that Pakistan help the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights establish a local branch.

It may be noted that Pakistan’s GSP Plus status was extended for four years in October. With this status, Pakistan can export its products to the European market with little or no duty.

Pakistan has enjoyed this status for many years and the country has also benefited from it, due to which the trade volume, which was 8.3 billion Euros in 2013, has increased to more than 14 billion Euros now.

Many domestic and international organizations have expressed their concern over human rights violations in Pakistan. But it is believed that when the atmosphere of oppression is increasing in the country and the rights of minorities, small nations and critical thinkers are being violated on a large scale. In such a situation, many human rights workers have welcomed this report.

Sami Deen Baloch, who raised her voice against enforced disappearances in Balochistan, says that she thinks the mention of human rights violations in this report is a positive development. “By doing this, the EU has boosted the morale of those who are fighting against human rights violations,” he told DW. It is necessary that apart from the European Union, other international organizations also raise their voices in protest in this regard.

According to Sami Deen Baloch, international organizations should make any kind of financial support to Pakistan subject to the improvement of human rights. “Thousands of people are missing in the country and this process of enforced disappearance is still going on. Human rights violations can be stopped if international organizations effectively put pressure on Pakistan.

The report should be taken seriously

It is believed that many international organizations express concern over human rights violations but Pakistan’s ruling class ignores it. Secretary General of National Trade Union Federation Nasir Mansoor says that Pakistan should take this report very seriously. “The European Union has set 27 points for GSP Plus status, out of which Pakistan is already in the gray area on many points such as death penalty, labor rights, minority rights,” he told DW. Rights etc etc. If Pakistan does not take this seriously, the country will suffer a lot economically.

Asad Butt from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan says that since 2020, there has been no change in the human rights situation because no one is interested in it and the GHQ has control over all the institutions of the country. There is dominance. “Anyone who raises their voice for human rights is suppressed while politicians are not interested in the issue,” he told DW. Before coming to power, they talk about forced disappearances and media clampdowns, but later they bow down to powerful circles.”

According to Asad Butt, in the past, Maryam Nawaz and Imran Khan also made promises regarding the missing persons. But after coming to power, everyone forgets their promises. Thousands of people are missing in the country but political parties are not ready to discuss this important issue.

Asad Butt said that human rights are respected where there is rule of law. “Here, the establishment has taken over all the institutions. The media, courts, politicians and civil society organizations are all powerless in front of them. They have almost wiped out many civil society organizations, so how can the situation of human rights improve in such a situation?

Human rights activist Tahira Abdullah says that adequate international pressure has not been put on Pakistan. “There is a need for domestic human rights activists and the judiciary to force the Pakistani government to ratify the UN Convention on Forced Displacement,” he told media. According to Tahira Abdullah, if domestic pressure does not work, then international financial support should be used as a leverage.

1142371583,20231125,"During his state visit to the United Kingdom on May 24–26, President Barack Obama should reaffirm the vital importance of the Special Relationship.[1] This affirmation should go beyond words and address the tensions in the Anglo–American alliance that have built up during the President’s first two years in office.

These tensions are the result of the fact that the United States has undervalued its key allies—including Britain—while Britain has done too little to ensure that it remains a sovereign and capable partner within NATO and with the U.S.

The Special Relationship rests on three pillars:
• First, the U.S. and Britain must each desire and seek to play a leading role in the world.
• Second, both must retain the classically liberal values on which the U.S. was founded and that have strongly influenced Britain’s politics, culture, and view of its role in the world.
• Third, the relations that both Britain and the U.S. have with other nations must be compatible with the continued existence of the Special Relationship.

Regrettably, all three pillars are under strain, and in some cases, the strain is serious. The recent U.S. emphasis on “soft power” and multilateralism betokens a retreat from leadership, as do ongoing reductions in British defense spending. Both countries have long since left the path of classical liberalism. Finally, the U.S. is increasingly prioritizing other parts of the world—particularly the Middle and Far East—over Europe, while Britain’s sovereignty and ability to play an independent and assertive role in the world is being eaten away by the European Union.

The Foreign Policy of the Obama Administration

The foreign policy of the Obama Administration feeds into and exemplifies these disheartening trends. It does not regard Europe as the most important region in the world or Britain, the leading power in Europe, as America’s most important ally. It has emphasized its desire to win better relations with undemocratic regimes and has therefore played down America’s traditional alliance relationships. Finally, by “leading from behind,” it has further devalued all of its alliance relationships, especially its relationship with the U.K.

There have been some encouraging developments in Anglo–American relations over the past two years. First, the U.S. has finally ratified the U.S.–U.K. Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty. Second, after much hesitation and many mixed messages, the U.S. has committed to remaining in Afghanistan beyond the Administration’s nominal deadline of July 2011. Given Britain’s continued commitment to the fight, it would have been disastrous for Anglo–American relations—not to mention for the region and the cause of defeating the Taliban and al-Qaeda—if the U.S. had begun a precipitate retreat. Third, in the context of the President’s visit, the White House now speaks glowingly about the “Special Relationship.” What has not happened is any sustained effort to make the realities of U.S. policy match this rhetoric.

What the U.S. and Britain Should Do

The state of Anglo–American relations is not good. The goal of both President Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron should be to improve them. Repairing the Special Relationship will require recognizing the sources of Anglo–American friction and taking serious steps to address them. Making high-flown declarations of common purpose will not suffice.

The single greatest danger to the Special Relationship is any belief that neither nation needs to lead in the world and, thus, that neither needs allies. The first necessity for both leaders is therefore to commit their nations to a policy of international leadership conducted together in concert with their allies.
• Accordingly, Obama and Cameron should commit their nations to negotiating a timely renewal of the U.S.–U.K. Mutual Defense Agreement in substantially its current form.

The second most important danger is the material risk posed by the government debt burdens in both Britain and the U.S. Neither the U.S. nor Britain can play a leading international role if they are bankrupt or if they pay their bills by cutting their armed forces. Both nations need to recognize that their alliance relationships, economic future, and roles in the world rest on their financial and military strength. In both countries, entitlement spending is threatening this strength. They need to address and control this threat in a way that allows their economies to grow and thus fund affordable and reliable military forces.
• While Britain correctly recognizes the dangers of deficit spending, it needs to adopt a pro-growth economic strategy that emphasizes deregulation, lowers taxes, and reforms its pension system to place its finances on a sustainable footing.
• The U.S. still has the opportunity to avoid the worst of the problems that Britain must confront. U.S. deficits are too large, but the government’s share of the economy is smaller than Britain’s. It should act now by following the same program of deregulation, lower taxes, and entitlement reform.
• Britain should commit to restoring defense spending to its 1996 level of 2.9 percent of GDP by the end of the next Parliament. It should couple this increase with a reexamination of its security and defense strategies that is not driven by budgetary concerns.
• The U.S. should correct the under-funding of its core military budget, ensure that funding for overseas contingencies is sufficient, and find savings in the defense budget that can be redirected to procurement.

Third, and finally, both leaders should address specific causes of Anglo–American friction. The alternative is to continue the current drift to the detriment of the Special Relationship and British and American values and interests.
• The U.S. and Britain should express their exclusive commitment to NATO as the security alliance for Europe and declare their resolve to continue operations in Afghanistan, isolate and pressure Iran, and ensure that the Muammar Qadhafi regime is removed from power.
• The U.S. should stop supporting European integration and instead seek to deal with European states, particularly Britain, on a bilateral basis.
• The U.S. and Britain should cooperate to implement the Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty and ensure the smooth operation and promote public understanding of the U.S.–U.K. Extradition Treaty.
• While respecting Britain’s right to make its own laws, President Obama should express concern about the long-term and unintended damage that Britain’s new immigration policies could cause to the Special Relationship.
• The President should press Cameron to state publicly that future conventional arms treaties need to be adopted on the basis of consensus on high and verifiable standards and that Britain will neither join nor lead a breakaway.

Just because the Special Relationship is deep and important does not mean it is immune from disruption. If the alliance between Britain and the U.S. is to remain special, its partners must treat each other specially and better than they do other states. The President and the Prime Minister have a vital obligation to pursue policies that clearly demonstrate the value that they place on the Special Relationship.

1142371586,20231125,"As you probably know, Finland joined NATO back in April becoming the 31st member of the group. This irritated Vladimir Putin whose supposed goal for invading Ukraine was keeping NATO away from his border. Now he has a NATO member sharing an 800 mile border with his country.

This week Finland announced it was closing its border crossings with Russia (all but one) in an attempt to reduced the number of asylum-seekers who are showing up. Finland claimed the asylum-seekers, who are mostly from the Middle East and North Africa, are being directed to the border by Russia as a way to create problems for the country and even to destabilize it.

More than 700 migrants from nations such as Yemen, Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria, have in the past couple of weeks entered Finland via Russia. Helsinki says Russia is funneling migrants to the border, a charge the Kremlin has denied. Having last week closed four border stations, Finland overnight closed all remaining passenger crossings except its northernmost one, Raja-Jooseppi located high north in the Arctic region, for a month.

Russia responded by promising to transport asylum-seekers to the one remaining border crossing.

This is basically what Finland claims Russia has been doing all along. Finland posted an official statement on Wednesday suggesting the migrants being sent to Finland were connected to international crime.

Illegal immigration at Finland’s eastern border has continued to grow and has also expanded to other border crossings. Based on the observations made by the Border Guard and other authorities and the information received, it is clear that the authorities of a foreign country and other actors play a role in facilitating the arrival of persons who have crossed the border to Finland. The phenomenon is also related to international crime. The phenomenon and the threat of its further expansion pose a serious threat to national security and public order in Finland and elsewhere in the Schengen area. The measures in accordance with the current decision have not stopped the phenomenon in the intended way.

There’s a video posted on X which shows what is happening. The asylum-seekers mostly arrive on bikes. But the bikes are provided by Russian authorities.

EU border guards are also coming to Finland’s border to help keep order.

It’s interesting to see Finland responding to 700 migrants arriving in one month as “hybrid warfare” by Russia. Finland’s foreign minister has already said her country will close the border completely if necessary to prevent threats from entering. The concern is that soldiers concealing their identity could be pushed across the border along with actual asylum-seekers.

Finland is prepared to close all its border crossings with Russia if necessary and has warned that Moscow could try to smuggle soldiers or war criminals into the EU among the migrants it is deliberately sending across the frontier. Elina Valtonen, Finland’s foreign minister, told the Financial Times that if Russia intensified its operation of allowing migrants from countries such as Yemen, Iraq and Syria to cross without documents, her country could restrict the filing of asylum applications to Helsinki airport — and so exclude its checkpoints along the land border. Finland says Russia is using the migrants to put a kind of pressure on Helsinki that falls short of outright hostilities, a method sometimes known as “hybrid” warfare or operations… “It’s more of a philosophical question — we cannot have Russia decide which people come to the border, and which people come over,” she said, adding that the lack of documents complicated the process of checking people’s identities.

Right on cue, Russian propagandists are making threats.

Here’s a DW report on the situation. This confirms that these migrants are being brought across Russia (partly by plane) just to be sent to the border with Finland."

Administration officials say the additional oil will begin to be added in January. It’s just a drop in the bucket compared to the nearly 300 million barrels President Biden has released since he took office. While the U.S. stockpile was declining, China was adding to its reserves.

""I think China is looking ahead at the future and seeing that geopolitically, economically, there's a great deal of uncertainty and volatility in the world,"" American Exploration and Production Council CEO Anne Bradbury said.

In November 2021, President Biden announced the U.S. and other countries would release millions of barrels from their oil stockpiles. At the time, even China had said it would tap its reserves.

""They all agreed to release additional oil from the reserves, and China may be doing so as well,"" Biden said in December 2021.

EXPERTS RAISE ALARM AFTER BIDEN STRIKES AGREEMENT WITH CHINA TO SHUT DOWN FOSSIL FUELS

It appears China never sold from its reserves after Biden’s remarks.

""We have no evidence to show that China drew down its strategic reserves in conjunction with the November 2021 strategic draw,"" Managing Director of Clearview Energy Partners Kevin Book said. ""The reason probably has something to do with China's own perception of its security. They probably didn't want to put themselves at any more risk.""

BIDEN'S WAR ON OIL DRILLING THREATENS TO KILL HIS OWN GREEN ENERGY GOALS: 'A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY'

China’s National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration said at the time that the sales would occur close to the Lunar New Year. That fell on Feb. 1 in 2022. On Feb. 4, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing for the Winter Olympics. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was just 20 days away.

As Russian troops gathered at the Ukrainian border, the White House threatened sanctions against financial institutions. The administration pushed back against concerns China could help Russia avoid the sanctions.

""China may want Russia as its junior partner for gas or cheap oil. But let's not pretend it's anything else,"" White House Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh said during the announcement.

Days later, the invasion officially began, prompting U.S. economic sanctions against Russia. By March, the U.S. had added oil sanctions. The European Union reached an agreement in May, announcing it would back most Russian oil by the end of 2022. By then, the U.S. and allies had agreed to release millions of barrels from their reserves over several months to combat high prices. Meanwhile, China was buying and stockpiling cheap oil.

""When Putin weaponized energy, basically it sent a shock wave to Europe, our allies, and we weren't able to help them because we weren't energy secure ourselves,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said.

European Union member states are mandated to have at least 90 days of crude oil in reserves. After the drawdowns, nearly half of European countries fell below their 90-day target.

""The EU is really ground zero for supply disruptions over the last couple of years as they try to wean themselves off of Russian oil and natural gas,"" Bradbury said. ""The strategic reserves are critical, and they're going to continue to be critical moving forward.""

The U.S. sold some of its reserves to China. The Energy Department announced Unipec America Incorporated purchased nearly 1 million barrels. The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China International United Petroleum and Chemical Co. Ltd.

""China loves a bargain,"" Book said. ""They are the biggest oil importing country in the world. And when they can save a barrel, they're probably going to save a barrel. When they can save money on a barrel, they're probably going to do that too.""

China does not disclose how much crude oil flows in or out of its strategic reserves, but analysts point to an increase in imports from cheap sellers like Russia and Iran. Trade data reveals China could be sitting on a massive stockpile of oil.

""China depends on imported energy for about 25% of the energy it consumes. So having energy in reserve when you're that dependent on imports is extremely important,"" Book said.

Data from S&P Global estimates China’s crude oil inventory, which compromises its commercial and strategic petroleum reserve, could be more than 1.1 billion barrels.

""We know that Russia and China are working together and that China has very few qualms about purchasing Russian oil and about putting its own energy security first and foremost,"" Bradbury said.

China imports cheap oil from countries facing U.S. sanctions, like Russia and Iran. Imports from Russia increased by nearly 23% in the first half of 2023 to more than 2 million barrels per day. China is Iran’s top customer, buying an estimated 1 million barrels per day in 2023.

Iranian oil is often relabeled as originating from countries like Malaysia, the UAE or Oman to avoid sanctions. However, oil market experts say China’s oil strategy has had little impact on the overall market.

1142379582,20231125,"Sri Lanka has fallen well short of its obligations linked to the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+), Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. 

Sri Lanka's economy has contracted every year since 2019, but exports to the European Union have increased, providing vital income in desperate economic times.

This has largely been due to the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+), which grants Sri Lanka tariff-free access to the EU market so long as it complies with core human rights and labor rights treaties.

But, as the EU noted in a new report , the Sri Lankan Government is falling well short of the mark, HRW said.

The report identifies two bright spots for human rights in Sri Lanka: the“resilience” of civil society; and the 2022 Aragalaya (“struggle” in Sinhala) movement in which thousands protested for good governance“in the spirit of democracy and freedom of expression and assembly.”

Yet the report makes clear that civil society's“resilience” is necessary in the face of government“harassment and intimidation.” Since President Ranil Wickremesinghe took office in July 2022, the government has adopted a“repressive response” to protests, arresting the movement's leaders and employing“disproportionate use of force.”

This challenges the EU's policy to assist Sri Lanka's recovery from its economic, governance and human rights crises. As the report states,“The process of reform will be more sustainable and robust if Sri Lankan civil society is part of it and if the approach is truly inclusive.”

Notably, the Government has yet to repeal the abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act – a key commitment to the EU – and even broke a moratorium on its use. As the International Monetary Fund noted in September, civil society's“oversight and monitoring” of government actions is“restricted ... by broad application of counter-terrorism rules.”

Instead, the Government has proposed new counterterrorism legislation that does not meet rights standards, and an Online Safety Bill that the EU says“could lead to censorship.” Other rights concerns the EU highlighted include the“treatment of minorities ... hate crimes ... allegations of torture ... decriminalising same sex relations ... domestic violence and child abuse ... [and] harassment and threats against human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists.”

These and other developments are incompatible with the GSP+ human rights requirements, and yet Sri Lanka's government continues to benefit from the program, HRW said

For conditionality to be credible, the GSP regulation needs to be reformed to require clear, public, and timebound benchmarks for compliance. HRW says this is what EU lawmakers should focus on: making GSP more effective in fostering human rights progress in beneficiary countries. (Colombo Gazette)"

1142386669,20231125,"(RFE/RL) — It was 20 years ago that Georgia’s Rose Revolution applied a radical jolt to the country’s politics, economy, and foreign policy. For many in Georgia and abroad, the revolution and the man it brought to the presidency, Mikheil Saakashvili, represented a new hope for the poor, isolated country.

But when the anniversary is marked on November 23 — the day Eduard Shevardnadze, the country’s president and Soviet-era leader, resigned — many in Georgia won’t be celebrating. Especially the current leadership.



“The Rose Revolution brought to this country torture, corruption, the loss of 20 percent of our territories,” said Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of the ruling Georgian Dream party, last week. “To celebrate the 20th anniversary is simply shameless.”



The degree of vitriol between Georgia’s current and former ruling parties is hard to overstate. Georgian Dream, which took power in 2012 after defeating Saakashvili and his United National Movement (ENM), to this day defines itself primarily in opposition to the former regime. Saakashvili, now in jail on a variety of charges from his time in office, calls his successors Russian puppets and says the charges against him are politically motivated.

Polarization in Georgian politics is so deep that the European Union emphasized it as one of the key issues in the country’s bid to become a candidate to join the bloc.



That bitter animosity, however, obscures just how much the Georgian Dream government is continuing along the path that the Rose Revolution began to blaze 20 years ago. From foreign policy to resolving its separatist conflicts to the economy, the government today is in significant ways fulfilling the legacy set by its hated enemies.

The divide in Georgian politics “is not really polarization in classical terms like in Western countries, where it is based on ideologies,” said Kornely Kakachia, the head of the Tbilisi think tank Georgian Institute for Politics. “In Georgia, what we have is more like personality-driven polarization…. They are just cursing each other, talking about how bad their opponent is, but never talking about issues.”



A 2021 study by a group of political scientists for the German Friedrich Ebert Foundation found that the policies of the two main feuding blocs — Georgian Dream and Saakashvili’s ENM — had more commonalities than differences, especially in terms of economic policy.



Under Shevardnadze’s rule, the economy was stagnating and there were widespread allegations of state corruption. Suspicions of vote-rigging in November 2003 parliamentary elections led to thousands of Georgians taking to the streets, culminating on November 22, 2003, with Saakashvili supporters storming parliament, prompting the embattled president to flee.



Elected by a landslide in new elections six weeks later, Saakashvili and his government had a strong ideological vision: a staunchly pro-Western foreign policy and a radically free-market economic policy.

Under his rule, the country became a close ally of the United States and its enmity with Russia deepened to the point that the two fought a war in 2008 over the breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The economy opened up to such a degree that, in the last year of Saakashvili’s rule, the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings placed Georgia ninth in the world.

But Saakashvili and the ENM were voted out in 2012 by Georgian Dream, a diverse coalition assembled by billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili that had little in common besides a desire to remove a regime that was seen as being increasingly authoritarian. Saakashvili’s party was accused of persistent abuses of power, exemplified by a prison-torture scandal that broke shortly before the elections.



What came after Saakashvili, though, did not amount to a drastic change or a new political direction. “Ivanishvili is not a very political person. He doesn’t have a vision or any ideology or program,” Kakachia said. “This affected the whole Georgian Dream; they were more opportunistic than ENM, which had its own political vision.”



Once in office, Georgian Dream did bring in a few policy innovations. Most notably, the new leadership has taken a less confrontational approach toward Russia, even as it continued moving closer to the West at the same time.

In the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Georgian Dream has doubled down on its policy of accommodating Moscow. Just how Georgia should deal with Russia has become the sharpest point of contention in the country’s politics.



Lately, Georgian Dream has taken a sharp turn toward social conservatism, embracing rhetoric of “family values” and identity, inspired by the example of Viktor Orban’s Hungary. (While Saakashvili and his government were not outspoken liberals, cultural issues played little role in the way they governed.)

But to many Georgians, the similarities between the two regimes still outweigh the differences.

Take the loss of 20 percent of the country’s territory that Georgian Dream Chairman Kobakhidze mentioned. It refers to the war over South Ossetia in 2008, which resulted in a Russian invasion of Georgia and Moscow’s subsequent recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent republics. Both now host thousands of Russian troops.

While the territories broke away in the early 1990s, well before Saakashvili came to power, the 2008 war cemented the loss. It is one of Georgian Dream’s favorite talking points.



But Georgian Dream for the most part follows the agenda set by Saakashvili’s government, argues Paata Zakareshvili, who served as state minister for reconciliation and civic equality in the early days of Georgian Dream rule and is now a sharp critic of both regimes.



While the previous government under Shevardnadze had held regular dialogues with representatives of the de facto governments in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Saakashvili halted those talks. “There is no point in talking to Abkhazians and Ossetians. They are nobody. Russia and Moscow decide everything,” Zakareshvili said, paraphrasing the previous government’s approach. “That was [Saakashvili’s] concept.”

When Georgian Dream came to power, little changed. “They took the same approach, they just modernized it,” Zakareshvili told RFE/RL. The government continues to refuse to talk to the de facto entities, for the most part out of inertia and fear that doing otherwise would expose it to criticism, he says.



“They are afraid to touch this topic,” Zakareshvili said. “As soon as Georgian Dream would start talking to [Abkhazians and South Ossetians], the nationalists would say, ‘You see, they are carrying out a Russian policy….’ They don’t have a policy, they only have inaction.”



In relation to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgian Dream accepts the premise that Russia is the only party worth dealing with; its innovation is trying to accommodate and placate Moscow rather than confronting it directly, as did the ENM leadership. But both suffer from the same fatal flaw, Zakareshvili notes.

“Russia is a problem. They are 80 percent of the problem, but the other 20 percent is our problem with the Abkhazians and Ossetians. As long as we don’t solve this problem, Russia is going to take advantage of it,” he said.

Despite Kobakhidze’s protestations about the human rights record of the Saakashvili government, many argue that the two regimes are following similar trajectories: an initial opening up and liberalization, followed by gradually increasing authoritarianism.

“With every successive regime, we have returned again and again to a single-party system that controls more and more institutions,” President Salome Zurabishvili said in a recent interview. The president was elected to the largely symbolic post in 2018 with the backing of Georgian Dream, but has since become an outspoken critic of the ruling party.

Georgian Dream recently tried to impeach the president over trips she made to the European Union without the consent of the government, but the motion failed to gain enough votes in parliament.



The petty corruption that Saakashvili famously stamped out with a full-scale overhaul of the law enforcement system has been almost wiped out in Georgia, while the high-level variety — politically connected businessmen getting favorable treatment — remains present.



But it is in the economic sphere where the continuity between the two parties’ time in power is most pronounced. The radical economic changes that the Rose Revolution wrought — a strong adherence to the free market and deregulation — if anything have only deepened.

Under Saakashvili, Georgia placed a heavy priority on attracting foreign investment, believing it was the key to attracting the capital required for the country to grow. So, it reduced and simplified taxes and slashed regulations. To woo foreign investors, they touted the fact that the country has no minimum wage. “Establishing a laissez-faire state after the Rose Revolution became one of the central discourses of nation-building,” political economist Ia Eradze wrote.

That strategy did attract investors and boost GDP growth, but the benefits did not accrue to ordinary Georgians, Eradze says. And when Georgian Dream came to power and started publishing economic development strategies, they initially criticized the previous government’s approach. “And I thought, ‘OK, this looks kind of promising, let’s see what happens,'” Eradze told RFE/RL. “But then there was really no substantial change.”



Toward the end of the Saakashvili era, the government passed the Economic Liberty Act, which enshrined principles of austerity in the constitution. The law made it impossible to significantly raise taxes without a referendum, for example. The law, Saakashvili promised when introducing it, represented “an ambition to turn Georgia into a real flagship of the world liberal economic ideology.”



Critics say the law hamstrings the government’s ability to manage the economy and, in 2017, there was an effort to revoke it. But, in the end, the government kept it on the books for 12 more years.

“We are still dependent on the agenda that Saakashvili set,” said Beka Natsvlishvili, a lecturer of political economy and a former member of parliament in a social-democratic faction of Georgian Dream. (Natsvlishvili pushed for the revocation of the Economic Liberty Act and broke with the party in 2019 over its economic policies.)

“Nobody [in the current government] talks about economic policy, because it is the conventional wisdom that the market would regulate everything, we have this kind of path dependency,” he told RFE/RL.



In some ways, Georgian Dream even goes further than its predecessors. This year, the government rolled out a new pension scheme in which individuals themselves have to choose how to invest their retirement savings.

“In the case of pensions, they even deepened the neoliberalism,” Natsvlishvili said.



In 2020, the last year the World Bank did its Ease of Doing Business rankings, Georgia had continued to climb, reaching seventh in the world. For a party largely uninterested in economic issues, staying devoted to the free market is the path of least resistance, Eradze says.



“This existing kind of view of development, that as a state you just create all favorable conditions for [foreign direct investment] to come in and then everything just happens on its own — it’s an easy way to think of development,” she said. “It can also bring fast revenues. So, you have this kind of immediate result and then, as a prime minister, you can get on TV and tell the population, ‘Look, our economy grew’ and who cares how.”



A more hands-on economic policy, by contrast, takes a lot of work. Eradze says a more actively engaged government would have to work out a policy sector-by-sector, coordinate the actions with the central bank, and implement corresponding education reforms.

“This all has to go hand in hand, and you might see the results after 10 years. I have a feeling nobody wants to put that much effort into it,” she said.



Eradze notes that opinion polls consistently show Georgians’ top concerns are economic. A new survey, released in mid-November by the International Republican Institute, asked, “What is the most important problem facing our country today?” The top four answers — representing 67 percent of the responses — were all economic.



“If you look at our politics and the parties, neither the ruling party nor the opposition really brings up this topic,” she said. “It’s a huge, huge gap. I don’t know how long that can go on.”

1142388001,20231125,"“One of the ironies of contemporary US foreign policy”, Anwar said, is that the last three administrations “all sought to laser focus on the Indo-Pacific region”.

But history shows such promises are likely to go unfulfilled, according to Anu Anwar, a non-resident associate at Harvard University’s Fairbank Centre for Chinese Studies.

The US inevitably being distracted from the region is not a concern to which Secretary of State Antony Blinken would concede. Earlier this month, he told reporters that Washington will maintain an “intense” focus on the Asia-Pacific despite global conflicts elsewhere.

In the high-stakes game of geopolitics, the United States finds its strategic gaze once again diverted away from the Asia-Pacific by wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, raising questions about the resilience of its alliances and the future of its influence in a region shadowed by China ’s ambitions.

Why the US must engage Indonesia and Asean to restart its ‘pivot to Asia’

The pivot to Asia – aimed at strengthening everything from cooperation on climate change to regional security, trade and investment – unsurprisingly, found itself sidelined.

The difference this time may lie in the strength of alliances that the US has forged with regional partners. When Blinken claimed on November 8 that the US could maintain focus on the Indo-Pacific while simultaneously handling multiple security issues, he cited a network of allies that the Biden administration has called one of the country’s “greatest strategic assets”.

“The era of absolute US primacy in Asia may be over,” said Alice Nason, a foreign policy and defence research associate at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre. “But the US remains capable of bringing significant capabilities to bear across multiple regions.”

The “empowerment” of allies has been “the overriding priority” of the US’ Asia strategy since Biden entered office, Nason said, adding that ongoing conflicts will slow down “rather than stall” the momentum of US defence and diplomatic partnerships in the region.

If Washington becomes overstretched, fewer resources spent on hemming in China’s activities would mean fewer “freedom of navigation operations” and reconnaissance sorties around the country’s periphery.

Concerns about China taking advantage of an overextended US military are the reason Washington has placed so much emphasis on fostering security-cooperation initiatives in the Indo-Pacific, according to Muhammad Faizal Bin Abdul Rahman, a research fellow on regional security at the Singapore-based S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).

To deal with the prospect of a crisis in the South China Sea, Stephen Nagy, professor of politics and international studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, said “new mini-lateral relationships” will continue to emerge, especially between the Philippines, Japan and Australia.

Optimistic that Washington has the capacity to “keep its eyes” on the region, Nagy said it was not just the US that provides a framework for stability but also its partnerships and alliances, forged through Washington’s long-standing military engagement with the region.

Japan and Australia, he said, have stepped up to create reciprocal access agreements – defence pacts between countries aimed at providing shared military training and operations – and provide infrastructure and connectivity aid to the region.

Earlier this month, Japan and the Philippines agreed to seal a reciprocal pact that would allow their troops to enter each other’s territory for joint military exercises.

Japan and Australia also have a similar treaty to facilitate joint drills and strengthen security cooperation, which came into effect in August.

“[These pacts] ensure that the US understands that they are increasing their burden sharing within the partnerships,” Nagy said, noting that if crises occur both in the Taiwan Strait and on the Korean peninsula, Japan, Australia and New Zealand would be focused on the former while South Korean forces, backed up by the US, would deal with the latter.

“We should be clear that the US does not do this alone,” Nagy said.

University of Sydney’s Nason agreed that “the US relies on capable partners now more than ever to meet its regional security objectives”, adding that Washington’s sustained attention on its Indo-Pacific alliances and partnerships since the war in Ukraine began in February last year was a source of assurance.

“Competing for influence in the Indo-Pacific has been elevated as a bipartisan priority in a Congress divided in almost every other area,” she added.

Jacob Stokes, a senior fellow with the Centre for a New American Security think tank’s Indo-Pacific Security Programme who focuses on China, said Washington understood clearly that “China is not going away, far from it” and would thus not overcommit in another direction.

“While Washington staunchly supports both Ukraine and Israel, the US has not committed to fight directly on either’s behalf,” Stokes said. “That restraint stems in part from a recognition that US military power is needed in East Asia to deter aggression there.”

In addition to its growing aggression in the South China Sea, Beijing has also been carrying out military drills around Taiwan, including last Sunday, when nine of its aircraft crossed the median line in the Taiwan Strait, which serves as a de facto dividing line.

Beijing regards the island as a breakaway province to be brought under mainland control – by force, if necessary. Many countries, including the US, do not officially recognise Taiwan as an independent state but oppose the use of force to change the status quo.

Despite the dense network of US-aligned security partners around the Asia-Pacific, analysts say Washington’s diminished focus on the region will still have a big impact.

“The US does all the heavy lifting,” he said, adding that no other country was in a position to fill the gap.

Kei Koga, an associate professor in the Public Policy and Global Affairs Programme at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, said that while Japan hopes to take on greater defence roles, it is limited both constitutionally and politically – though some of these constraints have been relaxed in recent years.

However, large pockets of the Japanese public have expressed concerns about their country’s growing defence capabilities, with 80 per cent saying they were opposed to tax increases aimed at financing defence spending in a poll conducted in May by Kyodo News.

“Japan’s role will be uncertain,” Koga said, noting that Tokyo could however coordinate its policies with other allies such as Canberra and Seoul as these would contribute to the “preparation for regional contingencies”.

A long Israel-Gaza war could become a “geopolitical quagmire” for the US, RSIS’ Muhammad Faizal said, explaining that it would create doubts about whether the US and the West’s advocacy for international law and human rights were “principled or self-serving”.

“It creates diplomatic and propaganda opportunities for China and Russia,” Muhammad Faizal added, noting that Washington would find it tougher to convince the region of its Indo-Pacific strategy while sustaining its support for Ukraine.

As for Israel’s siege of Gaza, many critics have accused Western governments of failing in their responsibility to act in the face of credible accounts of war crimes being committed.

They have charged that calls for a ‘humanitarian pause’ are a distraction and an abrogation of humanitarian responsibilities, and say a ceasefire is the only way to stop the bloodshed.

Already – through the use of visceral, emotional, politically slanted and often false narratives – Moscow and Beijing are using their state and social media platforms to disparage Washington and undercut Israel.

Case in point: a Russian overseas news outlet, Sputnik India, quoted a military expert as saying, without evidence, that Washington had provided Israel with the rockets that hit the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza on October 17.

US attempts at realigning Asia-Pacific partners away from China are made more difficult by Washington’s lack of economic engagement with the region, analysts say – a state of affairs that is unlikely to change given the ongoing wars, and which stands in stark contrast to Beijing’s enthusiastic investments.

The collapse of the TPP under Trump came as a disappointment to the region and its replacement, Biden’s IPEF, does not promise the sort of trade deals and lowered tariffs that many countries were hoping for. Instead, the US says the IPEF will advance “resilience, sustainability, inclusiveness, economic growth, fairness, and competitiveness”.

Nagy said the framework was not the sort of deal that allows the US to “anchor itself into the region through concrete trade initiatives”.

“Now that these two wars have drained a large chunk of US economic resources, it will mean less investment in the region,” Anwar said.

Last year, total annual Chinese investment in belt and road infrastructure projects stood at US$67.8 billion, 34 per cent of which went to Asian countries, according to Statista, a German data-gathering platform.

In Southeast Asia, China disbursed about US$5 billion annually in development finance between 2015 and 2021, with infrastructure accounting for 75 per cent including projects in transport and storage, energy, communications, and water and sanitation.

Given the “stilted” progress of the IPEF from the outset, Nason said the US would continue “to walk on one leg in its Indo-Pacific Strategy” as it was militarily strong, but economically weak.

“It has just been announced, it will take years for it to move forward,” he said, referring to the deal signed by the governments of the US, India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union.

Under the vision, a railway is expected to link ports connecting Europe, the Middle East and Asia, while facilitating the development and export of clean energy and strengthening food security and supply chains.

India’s Modi slammed for his ‘complete solidarity’ with Israel over Palestinians

“[These] may put Muslim-majority Middle Eastern countries on a pause as to how much deeper engagement they sought to build with India,” he said.

Since the start of the war in Gaza, Modi has thrown his support behind Israel, with India abstaining from voting on a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire."
1142390944,20231125,"The recent memorandum on labour rights issued by the United States is grounded in their foreign labour policy. This policy is not targeted at any specific country, but, according to them, will be applied wherever labour rights are disregarded.

We don't know if this policy will be implemented immediately, but countries with widespread labour rights violations should be wary of its potential impact. Therefore, it is crucial for our own country to examine its labour rights record, and the focus should be on ensuring that labour rights are upheld, instead of external rhetoric or potential sanctions.

We cannot deny the fact that labour rights are routinely violated in Bangladesh. There is a blatant infringement of workers' freedom of association. Even with the ILO Convention and existing labour rights laws, workers struggle to freely exercise their union rights. Joining a union often carries the stigma of criminality, and workers' attempts to advocate for their rights are met with retaliation and intimidation. Despite many reassurances by the Bangladesh government, it has repeatedly failed to keep its promises, including appropriate amendment of our labour law.

It's true that there are more unions registered now compared to a decade ago. However, mere registration of unions does not mean that each of them has effective bargaining agreements. Only a handful of unions have such agreements, and even those are functioning with difficulties. While the number of unions has risen, they have failed to foster a culture of healthy union practices.

The recent wage movement by RMG workers serves as a stark evidence of what happens when healthy union practices are suppressed and workers' unionisation rights are restricted. Had these workers had a platform for dialogue and collective bargaining within their respective factories, they would not be compelled to resort to protests. The brutal police crackdown on these protests, the evident political involvement, and the tragic loss of workers' lives would not have occurred if workers enjoyed the freedom to exercise their union rights. This constitutes another, severe labour rights violation.

When labour rights violations occur or unfair labour practices take place, we are supposed to go to court, right? But the workers cannot file complaints under such circumstances, per Section 195 of the labour law. As workers cannot directly approach the courts to file a case, they must first navigate the bureaucratic maze of the Department of Labour (DoL). The DoL often engages in protracted meetings, prolonging the complaint process. Out of 100 complaints lodged with the DoL, barely two receive approval for court proceedings. In those court proceedings, the DoL's performance is noticeably dismal: in 90 percent of the cases, they fail to win a conviction against the employer. DoL's failure to protect the union leaders from being victimised by the employers and its inability to enforce reinstatement of terminated union leaders have virtually destroyed the leaders' ability to meaningfully represent the workers.

The practice of running industries while paying workers abysmally low wages is another flagrant violation of labour rights. With the wages they get, they cannot afford adequate nutrition, yet they are expected to maintain or even increase production levels. It is unreasonable to expect optimal productivity from workers who are denied proper sustenance.

Within the RMG sector alone, approximately 40-42 lakh workers are employed, yet their children's education needs are largely neglected. Most of their children are deprived of education opportunities due to financial constraints. Neither the industry owners nor the government have taken any steps to ensure better educational prospects for workers' children. Gender-based violence in the workplace is another pervasive issue, yet there are no specific laws or protection mechanisms in place. Workers are left to endure these abuses in silence.

If this is the situation with labour rights in the country, we should fear not only the repercussions of the US memorandum, but also potential actions of the European Union, which is discussing the implementation of human rights due diligence. Moreover, we are currently pursuing an Everything but Arms (EBA) status under Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for the European market, but this agreement also comes with stringent rules and regulations. If the current conditions persist, there is a risk of restrictions on multiple fronts.

While we have made significant strides in ensuring workers' safety in the RMG sector since the Rana Plaza tragedy, our ability to confidently declare our RMG factories safe remains limited. Beyond this industry, the situation is far bleaker, as evidenced by incidents like the Hashem Food Factory fire, where workers, including many children, were burnt to death. Our government and RMG factory owners proudly boast numerous certified green and platinum factories. While this is commendable, if you examine closely, you'll notice a glaring disconnect between their certifications and labour rights practices. The focus has been on green certifications, carbon emissions and other environmental aspects, while the fundamental issue of fair wages and worker treatment has been overlooked.

Now, coming to the mention of my name in the context of the US memorandum, it is crucial to acknowledge the hardships that our organisation, colleagues and I have endured. We have faced lawsuits, imprisonment, and harassment related to our organisational registration. In 2012, one of my colleagues went missing, and his dead body was found later, but the real perpetrators are yet to be brought to justice. Six months ago, another colleague was brutally beaten to death while assisting workers in reclaiming their unpaid wages.

During the wage movement in 2016, my colleague was imprisoned for two and a half months. He had not committed any crime there. He was blindfolded and taken to a field, where he was told to run. We have faced such situations repeatedly.

If advocating for workers' rights exposes us to such risks, how can I be assured of my own safety? These are long-standing issues, and the US Embassy must be aware of them. Perhaps, it is due to these long-standing issues that they mentioned my name. However, I believe that there is no need for any government or foreign entity to seek our individual opinions on the situation. They have the resources and capacity to observe and analyse the realities of our industry and workers' conditions. The notion that the US is making decisions based solely on our statements is highly unlikely.

We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the plight of workers when the evidence of labour rights violations is in plain sight. We must create an environment where workers can freely exercise their rights, receive fair wages, and work in safe and dignified conditions. Only then can we build a sustainable industry that truly benefits our nation and the people who power it.

It should also be understood that when workers are vulnerable and facing challenges in upholding their rights, and as the government is bound by promises to uphold workers' rights, there is nothing wrong with the workers seeking support and solidarity from external allies to promote and enforce their rights. This is an acceptable practice worldwide.

1142392184,20231125,"The whole world seems to agree on the broad outlines of an agreement:
• The return of territories conquered in 1967 and the creation of a viable Palestinian state;
• The division of Jerusalem according to the principle “what is Jewish to Israel, what is Arab to Palestine’’; and
• The settlement of the problematic issue of refugees.

However, a solution only seems possible if the actors take into account the insurmountable limits of each, the red lines of the adversary: the “right of return” of Palestinian refugees for Israel; the perpetuation of control of the mosque plaza by Israel, for the Palestinians. As for the possibility of a binational state, it remains impossible in the eyes because it would open the door to civil war and apartheid. Those who, in Europe or elsewhere, favor this “solution” are irresponsible.

Perhaps never in history has there been such agreement on the inevitable outcome of a conflict: public opinion on the spot is ready for the necessary compromises, most of the political classes too and the international consensus, embodied by the quartet (EU, Russia, UN, United States), is absolute. And yet, nothing happens, essentially because of the intrinsic weakness of the parties, which makes them incapable of resolving the conflict between them on their own: Palestinian weakness, illustrated by the latent civil war between the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Hamas government in Gaza; and Israeli weakness, due to a political system incapable of achieving a stable majority.

To allow a resumption of dialogue, the US must reinvest in the establishment of a peace process. Europe should have its full place in the negotiations for several reasons. First of all because of its geographical proximity to the United States, which is particularly far from the problem, then because of its historical participation in the situation and finally, because it constitutes a significant economic weight in the region. Indeed, Europe remains the main commercial partner of the State of Israel and at the same time, the main donor of the Palestinian government.

To answer a very simple question: Is peace still possible? We can answer in the affirmative, however, we put forward three conditions:
• Move towards each other with a real desire to understand each other;
• Recognize the right to self-determination against all logic of unilateralism; and

Two fundamental points must be taken into consideration to understand the current situation. Firstly, the rise of a new political subject in Palestine, Hamas. Secondly, the new Israeli policy clearly committed to a massive colonization in the West Bank in violation of the Oslo accords.

From Oslo to Geneva, many unfulfilled peace plans

Facts As the war rages on in Gaza, peace seems so far away. Yet, on several occasions since 1990, Israelis and Palestinians have attempted to reach an agreement, first in Oslo, then at Camp David and Taba. These initiatives have stalled on issues such as border demarcation and the status of Jerusalem.

After the Hamas attacks which left 1,400 victims in Israel, Tel Aviv launched a bombing campaign against the Gaza Strip which has already killed more than 8,000 Palestinians. On both sides, the majority of victims are civilians. Peace has never seemed so far away.

However, on several occasions over the past three decades, Israeli and Palestinian leaders have met to negotiate peace agreements, under the aegis of the United States or the international community.

The most famous are the Oslo Accords, embodied by the handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat. Several other peace plans were proposed but did not come to fruition. They particularly stumble over the right of return of Palestinian refugees or the status of the holy places in Jerusalem.

The Oslo Accords: Following the first Intifada and after the Gulf War, Israel and the Palestinians accepted the principle of secret discussions in Oslo, Norway, in 1991. In September 1993, the two parties signed a declaration of principles in Washington, establishing a mode of negotiations and laying the basis for temporary Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza over five years.

Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), accepted Israel’s right to exist in peace and security. The Israeli government, led by Yitzhak Rabin, recognizes the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.

In May 1994, the Palestinian Authority was created, with limited powers. The West Bank was divided into three territories with distinct statuses, pending the conclusion of negotiations. The Palestinian Authority only exercises complete sovereignty over Area A, which includes the major cities of the West Bank. It has partial control over zone B, while the Israeli army retains domination of zone C (60% of the West Bank), where the Jewish settlements are located.

The settlement of the most contentious points is postponed for three years: the right of return of Palestinian refugees from 1948, the status of Jerusalem, Israeli colonies in the Occupied Territories, the drawing of borders, water and the demands of security of Israel.

Meanwhile, positions harden on each side. Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995 by a far-right Israeli student. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, opposed to the recognition of Israel, carried out suicide attacks to bypass the agreements. When the second Intifada broke out in September 2000, the Oslo Accords were stillborn.

The summits of Camp David II and Taba: In July 2000, Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian Authority, and Ehud Barak, Israeli Prime Minister, met at Camp David in the United States. The negotiations stumbled over Israel’s territorial demands in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and the holy sites, and the question of Palestinian refugees. The two parties part ways without finding a compromise but nevertheless agree on the principle of refraining from actions that would hinder future agreements.

Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak met again in January 2001 in Taba, Egypt, again under American mediation. During the negotiations, according to an unofficial European Union report, Israel agreed to territorial concessions, including the creation of a Palestinian state covering 97% of the West Bank and Gaza. The two sides also agreed on Jerusalem as an “open city” (Corpus separatum), with Palestinian sovereignty over Arab neighborhoods and Israeli sovereignty over Jewish neighborhoods. Concessions were also made on both sides regarding the return of Palestinian refugees and the alert posts in Palestinian territory demanded by Tel Aviv.

Yasser Arafat’s condemnation of Israel’s “fascist” aggression against the Palestinian people, followed by the election of Ariel Sharon as Prime Minister, hampered the continuation of negotiations.

Parallel initiatives:The Taba negotiators met again in Geneva, where in December 2003 they signed a document known as the “Geneva Initiative”. This provided for the sharing of sovereignty over Jerusalem, the capital of both states, the evacuation by Israel of 98% of the West Bank (including most of the settlements) and the Gaza Strip, and compensation for Palestinian refugees. However, while the Palestinian Authority supports the agreement, neither Ariel Sharon nor Hamas does.

In the spring of 2003, a quartet comprising the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia proposed a “roadmap” for a phased settlement of the conflict. Phase I aims to put an end to terrorism and normalize life for the Palestinians; Phase II provides for the creation of an independent Palestinian state with provisional borders; Phase III envisages the end of the conflict, including a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and Lebanon and between Israel and Syria.

An Arab Peace Initiative – a Saudi project adopted by the Arab League – was also launched in 2002. It is based on UN Security Council resolutions.

All these unfinished peace plans are based on a two-state solution which, thirty years after Oslo, has never managed to take hold.

I remain convinced of the need to combat four main dangers:
• The risk of collapse of the Palestinian Authority;
• A regional situation in which Iran’s influence could pollute the prospects for peace between Israelis and Palestinians; and
• French and European policy in the region is too timid. Israelis and Palestinians urgently need a comprehensive negotiated agreement based on clear, well-defined principles. The Geneva Accords would be a good basis for resuming negotiations. The logic of war and conflict cannot lead the two sides to peace.

While the situation for Palestinians has worsened in recent decades, the peace process has brought benefits to Israelis. Israeli governments have sometimes paid lip service to the peace process, deflecting much of the international criticism of Israel’s actions on the ground – making the reality of occupation and inequality seem merely a “temporary situation”, pending a future peace agreement. The structures put in place by the Oslo Accords, namely the PA and its security services, which closely coordinate their actions with those of the Israeli authorities, have also considerably improved the security of Israelis (and settlers).

The recent wave of announcements of normalization between Israel and the Arab states (Abraham Accords) has reinforced the feeling, prevalent among Israeli Jews, that the world and its immediate Arab neighborhood are moving in their direction, to the detriment of Palestinian aspirations. According to Netanyahu, the agreement with the UAE has confirmed the principle of “peace through strength“: “According to this doctrine, Israel is not obliged to withdraw from any territory and, together, the two countries reap the rewards of total peace “.

Given the relatively low political and security costs of an indefinite occupation, only a minority of Jewish Israelis see conflict resolution as a priority. Faced with a choice between maintaining the existing reality and de-occupation, a majority of Jewish Israelis prefer continuity to change. As a result, instead of debating how best to end the five-decade occupation, the debate in Israel focuses on how best to deal with the Palestinians to avoid the demographic threat of a one-state solution.

Today, there are broadly two schools of thought that reflect a majority of Israeli political and public opinion. Neither advocates a two-state solution based on international parameters, or on significant territorial withdrawal.

A first school of thought, embodied by some members of the right like Netanyahu, security officials and center-left politicians like Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, favors the current “status quo“, i.e. unlimited security control, as the best way to manage the conflict. This has been the dominant trend since the beginning of the occupation, and aims to preserve a degree of ambiguity in the status of the West Bank, avoiding any move towards formal Israeli annexation, or towards a Palestinian state. Some adherents sometimes speak of the need to separate from the Palestinians, or of the principle of “two states for two peoples”, in which Israel would retain exclusive control of Jerusalem and much of the West Bank. Through their actions, notably by allowing the continued growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, this school has progressively eroded the feasibility of a two-state solution.

A second school of thought supports practical measures to enforce Israeli sovereignty through the de jure annexation of all or part of the West Bank. This vision represents a more direct threat to the two-state solution, and is supported by a younger generation of right-wing politicians, such as Israel’s ex-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. In such a scenario, most Palestinians living in the OPT would be denied Israeli citizenship.

The new Israeli government is a mixture of these two schools. Bennett has been an ardent supporter of the settlement project, and has previously argued for formal annexation of Area C. These positions are shared by other right-wingers in his government. In contrast, the centrist Lapid seems to favor the continuation of the current model of occupation, stating in the past that he would seek US approval to continue building in the main Israeli settlement blocs. The small progressive Meretz party is perhaps the only Jewish party that still supports a traditional two-state solution, while Labor is somewhere in between.

Given its mix of ideological positions and fragile unity, the Israeli government will have little room to maneuver on such a contentious issue. In practice, this will likely result in maintaining the current status quo of gradual annexation as the default policy. The continuing evolution of the situation on the ground (October 7 events), and within Palestinian politics, could, however, force the government to address the conflict.

75 years after the UN partition plan, peace seems unattainable between Israelis and Palestinians, against a backdrop of continued settlement on the West Bank and the unlikelihood of a two-state solution. US President Donald Trump’s historic decision on December 5, 2017 – in a break with his predecessors – to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital has aroused the ire of Hamas in Palestine, which is calling for a “new intifada”. Negotiations, at a standstill for three years, are compromised. East Jerusalem, occupied and then annexed by Israel in 1967, is claimed by Palestinian leaders as the capital of the state to which they aspire. For its part, Israel claims all of Jerusalem.

Peace can only be achieved through the application of international law, which must put an end to one of the last colonial acts of the 21st century. This must include:
• Recognition of the State of Palestine with its capital in East Jerusalem, along the June 4, 1967 line;
• Implementation of UN resolutions, in particular article 11 of UN General Assembly Resolution 194 adopted on December 11, 1948, concerning the return of refugees; and

It is the recognition of the Palestinian people on their land, and of their right to self-determination and equal rights, that will enable the peaceful construction of Palestinian and Israeli societies.

1142392186,20231125,"The Energy Department is asking for bid prices to add around 3 million barrels to the strategic petroleum reserve. Administration officials say the additional oil will begin to be added in January. It’s just a drop in the bucket compared to the nearly 300 million barrels President Biden has released since he took office. While the U.S. stockpile was declining, China was adding to its reserves.

""I think China is looking ahead at the future and seeing that geopolitically, economically, there's a great deal of uncertainty and volatility in the world,"" American Exploration and Production Council CEO Anne Bradbury said.

In November 2021, President Biden announced the U.S. and other countries would release millions of barrels from their oil stockpiles. At the time, even China had said it would tap its reserves.

""They all agreed to release additional oil from the reserves, and China may be doing so as well,"" Biden said in December 2021.

EXPERTS RAISE ALARM AFTER BIDEN STRIKES AGREEMENT WITH CHINA TO SHUT DOWN FOSSIL FUELS

It appears China never sold from its reserves after Biden’s remarks.

""We have no evidence to show that China drew down its strategic reserves in conjunction with the November 2021 strategic draw,"" Managing Director of Clearview Energy Partners Kevin Book said. ""The reason probably has something to do with China's own perception of its security. They probably didn't want to put themselves at any more risk.""

BIDEN'S WAR ON OIL DRILLING THREATENS TO KILL HIS OWN GREEN ENERGY GOALS: 'A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY'

China’s National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration said at the time that the sales would occur close to the Lunar New Year. That fell on Feb. 1 in 2022. On Feb. 4, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing for the Winter Olympics. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was just 20 days away.

As Russian troops gathered at the Ukrainian border, the White House threatened sanctions against financial institutions. The administration pushed back against concerns China could help Russia avoid the sanctions.

""China may want Russia as its junior partner for gas or cheap oil. But let's not pretend it's anything else,"" White House Deputy National Security Adviser Daleep Singh said during the announcement.

Days later, the invasion officially began, prompting U.S. economic sanctions against Russia. By March, the U.S. had added oil sanctions. The European Union reached an agreement in May, announcing it would back most Russian oil by the end of 2022. By then, the U.S. and allies had agreed to release millions of barrels from their reserves over several months to combat high prices. Meanwhile, China was buying and stockpiling cheap oil.

US SEIZED NEARLY 1 MILLION BARRELS OF IRANIAN OIL BEING SMUGGLED TO CHINA

""When Putin weaponized energy, basically it sent a shock wave to Europe, our allies, and we weren't able to help them because we weren't energy secure ourselves,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said.

European Union member states are mandated to have at least 90 days of crude oil in reserves. After the drawdowns, nearly half of European countries fell below their 90-day target.

""The EU is really ground zero for supply disruptions over the last couple of years as they try to wean themselves off of Russian oil and natural gas,"" Bradbury said. ""The strategic reserves are critical, and they're going to continue to be critical moving forward.""

The U.S. sold some of its reserves to China. The Energy Department announced Unipec America Incorporated purchased nearly 1 million barrels. The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China International United Petroleum and Chemical Co. Ltd.

""China loves a bargain,"" Book said. ""They are the biggest oil importing country in the world. And when they can save a barrel, they're probably going to save a barrel. When they can save money on a barrel, they're probably going to do that too.""

China does not disclose how much crude oil flows in or out of its strategic reserves, but analysts point to an increase in imports from cheap sellers like Russia and Iran. Trade data reveals China could be sitting on a massive stockpile of oil.

""China depends on imported energy for about 25% of the energy it consumes. So having energy in reserve when you're that dependent on imports is extremely important,"" Book said.

Data from S&P Global estimates China’s crude oil inventory, which compromises its commercial and strategic petroleum reserve, could be more than 1.1 billion barrels.

""We know that Russia and China are working together and that China has very few qualms about purchasing Russian oil and about putting its own energy security first and foremost,"" Bradbury said.

China imports cheap oil from countries facing U.S. sanctions, like Russia and Iran. Imports from Russia increased by nearly 23% in the first half of 2023 to more than 2 million barrels per day. China is Iran’s top customer, buying an estimated 1 million barrels per day in 2023.

Iranian oil is often relabeled as originating from countries like Malaysia, the UAE or Oman to avoid sanctions. However, oil market experts say China’s oil strategy has had little impact on the overall market.

""It doesn't directly affect the global market in the sense that the oil price essentially reflects the global supply and demand balance,"" Book said. ""If China didn't buy the oil from Russia and Venezuela and Iran, then maybe somebody else would."""

1142394694,20231125,"German-made Leopard 1A5 tanks have begun to arrive in Ukraine in large numbers. A week after the first photos appeared online depicting one of the 40-ton, four-person tanks apparently near the front line, we now can confirm the identity of what might be the first brigade to operate the lightweight tanks.

It’s the Ukrainian army’s 44th Mechanized Brigade. A possible model unit for the Ukrainian army’s ongoing force-generation as Russia’s wider war on Ukraine grinds toward its third year and the usual mud-bound early-winter stalemate sets in.

The newly formed 44th Brigade’s main equipment—Leopard 1A5s and Polish-made Wolverine fighting vehicles—should be available in large quantity through the coming year. A German-Dutch-Danish consortium so far has identified nearly 200 of the 1980s-vintage Leopard 1A5s it can pay industry to recondition before shipping them off to Poland for training, and then to Ukraine for front-line use.

Poland meanwhile has pledged to Ukraine 200 of the 25-ton, eight-wheel Wolverines—and could pledge more as production of the nimble fighting vehicle ramps up. Ukraine soon should have enough Leopard 1A5s and Wolverines to equip several brigades.

These brigades will be unevenly armored. Yes, the Leopards have fast, accurate fire-controls for their 105-millimeter main guns. But their steel armor is just 70 millimeters thick at its thickest, making them perhaps the least-protected tank in Russia’s 22-month wider war on Ukraine.

The Wolverines likewise have effective 30-millimeter autocannons, but their Polish designers wanted the vehicles to be capable of swimming. That meant reducing armor protection in order to keep down the Wolverines’ weight.

The 44th Brigade’s relative lightness compared to, say, the army’s dozens of brigades operating Soviet-vintage tanks—or to the 10 or so brigades Ukraine’s NATO allies equipped for last summer’s southern counteroffensive—could weigh on their potential for major offensive action.

But it won’t be the exact amount of armor protection on a few hundred vehicles that decides whether Ukraine can resume offensive action once the early-winter mud dries up in January or February.

No, Ukraine’s main problems are threefold: artillery ammunition, mine-reconnaissance and battlefield leadership. “The prerequisite condition for any offensive action is fires dominance,” Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds wrote in a study for the Royal United Services Institute in London.

Despite suffering frequent ammunition-shortages, Ukrainian artillery batteries lately have managed to achieve local firepower superiority over Russian batteries. “This has been achieved through blinding the counterbattery capability of Russian guns and the availability of precise and long-range artillery systems,” Watling and Reynolds wrote.

“Ensuring the sustainability of this advantage by properly resourcing ammunition production and spares for a consolidated artillery park is critical,” the analysts added.

But that means sustained support from the entities that provide the bulk of Ukraine’s shells: the United States and the European Union. Pro-Russian Republicans in the U.S. Congress, and pro-Russian countries within the E.U.—Slovakia and Hungary, to name two—could complicate future ammo donations.

In addition to steady supplies of shells, the Ukrainians need technology and tactics for detecting and defeating or avoiding the biggest battlefield impediment to armored assaults. “Mines constrain Ukrainian vehicles in their ability to maneuver,” Watling and Reynolds explained.

“It is necessary to thoroughly [conduct mine-reconnaissance] ahead of any major push, lest equipment loss becomes unacceptable,” the analysts added. “This cannot be carried out in depth and often relies on dismounted engineers. It is therefore very difficult to plan operations beyond the defenses immediately in front of Ukrainian positions, meaning that breaches forwards are difficult to exploit.”

“Assistance, therefore, should focus on equipment and techniques for detecting mines.” That might include drones that can spot mines, as well as heavy engineering equipment plus training for Ukrainian sappers. Lots of them.

But all the shells and mine-clearing gear in the world doesn’t matter if Ukrainian brigades can’t use them at the right time and place in coordination with other forces in pursuit of a plan that results in something someone can call “victory.”

They don’t matter, in other words, without leadership. “Planning remains a significant challenge for Ukrainian units because of the limited availability of trained staff officers,” Watling and Reynolds wrote. “The rapid expansion of the [armed forces of Ukraine] with the mobilization of civilians means that there are many more units than staffs.”

Capable staff officers don’t show up on billion-dollar lists of pledged military aid. They don’t make for dramatic photo-shoots. No nativist, pro-invasion political movement makes a symbol of a staff officer the way it might turn a tank or fighting vehicle into an icon of its opposition to a free and democratic Ukraine.

But staff officers matter as much as ammunition and mine-clearing capabilities do. So it’s exciting for allies of Ukraine that Ukrainian brigades are getting a whole lot of fresh tanks and fighting vehicles respectively from Germany and Poland.

It’d be more exciting to see a million shells bound for Ukraine from Europe, a thousand newly-trained sappers graduating from a NATO engineering school or a few dozen clever majors and colonels peering at a map in a bunker somewhere."

Factors like competitive labour costs once placed it among the company's higher-ranking bases globally, VW brand chief Thomas Schaefer said during a visit to the country.But the costs of mitigating power outages caused by chronic production shortfalls at state-owned utility Eskom as well as rising labour costs and logjams on railways and at ports have eroded that advantage, he said.""Eventually you have to say, why are we building cars in a less competitive factory somewhere far away from the real market where the consumption is?"" Schaefer said. ""I'm very worried about it ...

The European Union in the Middle East – soft power or paper tiger?

As Brussels gears up for massive humanitarian aid for Gaza, EU leaders stressed the need for a long-term resolution to the Israel-Hamas conflict. This contains no re-occupation and no forced displacement.

They also emphasized that the Palestinian Authority should take over in Gaza while moving towards a two-state solution.

The European Union is doing in the Middle East what it does best: funding projects. That seems to be the only thing that the 27 governments can agree on.

Consequently, the European Union oftentimes looks like a resourceful bystander rather than a powerful mediator in this eternal conflict.

Panelists had slightly different ideas of what Europe's support for Israel should mean:

Israel's ""long-term strategy has been a total failure because it behaves like a colonial power,"" said Biscop. ""Belgium, my country, has been a colonial power. We gave up our colonies because we realized, in the end, we could only maintain them in a permanent stage of war. That should also be made clear to Israel.""

""It was a very good sign that Roberta Metsola and Ursula von der Leyen were one of the first world leaders to visit the kibbutz closest to the Gaza border,"" said Pasarić.

""The European Union unanimously decided to be on the side of Israel. Israel has the right to defend itself.""

Panelists also discussed the political situation in Spain now that Pedro Sánchez is back in power thanks to a deal between his Socialists and Catalan separatists.

His decision to accede to some of the demands of pro-independence parties has proved profoundly divisive.

They made their backing for his new government dependent on an amnesty for hundreds of people involved in the illegal referendum to secede from Spain.

1142412267,20231125,"(Bloomberg) -- The ascent of Geert Wilders’ party has thrown Dutch climate ambitions into limbo, with environmental groups warning of “devastating” effects for progress on green targets.

The shock victory of the populist Freedom Party in this week’s election echoed a surge in support for far-right groups across Europe, driven mainly by concerns over living costs and immigration. While Wilders’ pledges particularly appealed to voters seeking to limit migrant numbers, his party’s manifesto includes proposals to stop reducing carbon-dioxide emissions and put key climate agreements “through the shredder.”

On the day after the vote the mood at the Netherlands’ climate ministry was best described as funereal, a person familiar with the matter said. Many officials mourned the election result, afraid that their years of hard work will be dismantled by a potential new government, the person said.

Disheartened staff members were consoled by the first — and perhaps last — Dutch Climate Minister Rob Jetten, who made rounds through the ministry after his Democrats 66 party lost support just a few hours earlier. It’s now set to gain just nine seats, down from 24 in the previous government.

The Netherlands has only recently come in sight of its 2030 climate goal to reduce emissions 55% compared to 1990 levels. The outgoing government warned in October that “rapid and ambitious” implementation of decarbonization plans was still crucial to achieving that aim.

While Wilders has said that he wants to exit the Paris climate accord and dismantle a fund aimed at reducing harmful emissions, it’s not yet clear what direction a new government will take as it would have to work alongside coalition partners with different political priorities.

The country also has European Union-level climate commitments it needs to comply with. The bloc is preparing to devise a 2040 emission-reduction goal next year, with EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra, a Dutch national, pledging to defend a target of at least a 90% net reduction versus 1990. However, a new goal that will be proposed after a new commission takes office next year will require political endorsement from EU leaders, and a potential U-turn by the Netherlands from its traditionally green stance could complicate Europe’s push.

“For investors who are convinced that the future will be net zero, it will be a negative signal. For investors that felt hampered by all the policy measures aiming at net zero, they might feel relief in the short term,” said Sandra Phlippen, Chief Economist of ABN Amro Bank NV of Wilders’ electoral success. It will be “interesting to watch” if his policies will be “paddled back,” she said.

Four Greenpeace campaigners kayaked into the pond in front of the prime minister’s office in The Hague on Thursday to protest the election result. The campaigners displayed a banner which called for “no climate denier as our prime minister.”

The election result is “devastating for climate, nature and people,” said Andy Palmen, director of Greenpeace Netherlands. “Wilders denies the climate crisis and denies science, it’s not acceptable that he might become our next prime minister.”

Greenpeace is calling on the other parties that are needed to form a government to “take responsibility” and address the climate issue, said Palmen. “Populist parties on the far-right side are on the rise in Europe, but lack solutions for the serious challenges we are facing as humanity,” he added.

The fragmented political landscape of the Netherlands means that Wilders faces a long series of negotiations if he wants to become prime minister of the country. Wilders has been courted by the Farmers’ Citizen Movement, known by its Dutch initials BBB, for a possible collaboration. The farmer party is set to have seven seats in the lower house of parliament and earlier this year became the largest party in the upper house.

As the Netherlands has sought to curb the environmental impact of agriculture, it has been battling the fury of its farmers. Last year, the government pushed to halve nitrogen emissions by 2030, which led to farmers blocking highways in protest. The plan — which was watered down earlier this year — aims at reducing livestock by a third as the sector is a key source of nitrogen emissions.

The BBB, led by politician Caroline van der Plas, made a statement by bringing seven tractors to the Hague on Friday to represent the seven seats they now have.

“Support for climate measures will be way lower in this new parliament,” said Kees Aarts, professor of political institutions and behavior at Groningen University. “The implementation of climate measures will be delayed and that is risky. This is a very bad development.”

Couple of days before his ouster, Altman had said at a tech event that big regulatory changes weren't needed for current AI models, but would be soon.

“We don't need heavy regulation here or probably for the next couple generations. But at some point, when a model can do the equivalent output of a whole company, or a whole country, or a whole world, maybe we do want some collective supervision around that,” he said on a panel at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco.

However, the OpenAI fiasco has once again triggered the call to regulate AI in such a way that such episodes are not repeated.

France, Germany and Italy have reached an agreement on how AI should be regulated.

However, businesses and tech groups have cautioned the European Union against excessive regulation of foundation models in upcoming AI rules.

""For Europe to become a global digital powerhouse, we need companies that can lead on AI innovation also using foundation models and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI),” DigitalEurope, whose members include Airbus, Apple, Ericsson, Google, LSE and SAP, wrote in a letter.

In India, concerns over deepfakes have put the government in motion to warn social media platforms to remove altered audio/video from their respective platforms or face action.

The government on Friday gave a seven-day deadline to social media platforms to tweak their policies as per Indian regulations in order to address the spread of deepfakes on their platforms.

Deepfakes could be subject to action under the current IT Rules, particularly Rule 3(1)(b), which mandates the removal of 12 types of content within 24 hours of receiving user complaints, said Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

The government will also take action of 100 per cent against such violations under the IT Rules in the future.

""They are further mandated to remove such content within 24 hours upon receiving a report from either a user or government authority. Failure to comply with this requirement invokes Rule 7, which empowers aggrieved individuals to take platforms to court under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),"" the minister said.

""For those who find themselves impacted by deepfakes, I strongly encourage you to file FIRs at your nearest police station,"" said Chandrasekhar, adding that the IT Ministry will help aggrieved users in filing FIRs in relation to deepfakes.

India is mulling regulation to tame the spread of deepfakes and other user harms that AI can bring along, said Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.

After meeting representatives from large social media platforms and other stakeholders, the minister said India will draft new rules to spot and limit the spread of deepfakes. The new regulation will also strengthen the reporting process for such deepfake videos.

After the successful AI Safety Summit in the UK, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) in Delhi next month will further deliberate upon the risks associated with AI -- in the presence of world leaders -- before a global framework is reached in Korea next year."

This is a key achievement for the EU amid difficulties in securing deals with Australia and other Latin American nations.

This agreement, set to be signed on December 21st, follows a unanimous decision by EU member states.

The decision emerged from a private meeting of ambassadors in Brussels. This new trade deal will replace the 2002 Association Agreement with Chile.

It aims to nearly eliminate tariffs on EU exports, potentially boosting the EU’s exports to Chile by as much as €4.5 billion (US$4.9 billion).

This information comes from the European Commission, highlighting the deal’s economic significance.

The agreement represents a strategic move for the EU to strengthen trade relations in Latin America.

It promises broader access to Chile’s market, especially for raw materials like lithium and copper. This aligns with the EU’s push for a more sustainable economy.

The EU Commission’s Trade Spokesperson, Olof Gill, emphasized the mutual desire for a swift ratification process.

He expressed confidence in finalizing the agreement before year-end, noting its current finalization phase in the EU.

Despite this progress, some unresolved issues linger, including the need for Chile to address certain trademark disputes raised by EU members.

Simultaneously, the EU is actively engaged in intensified negotiations with the Mercosur bloc, consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.

These talks, aiming to conclude over two decades of negotiations, face potential hurdles due to political changes in Argentina.

President-elect Javier Milei’s commitment to withdraw from Mercosur adds a layer of uncertainty to these discussions.

In another vein, the EU’s trade talks with Australia remain ongoing following a recent impasse over agricultural market access.

Despite various challenges, this continued effort underscores the EU’s broader strategy to expand its global trade partnerships."
