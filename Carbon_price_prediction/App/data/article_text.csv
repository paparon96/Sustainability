The European Union criticised Nicaragua’s decision to expel its ambassador and break relations with the Netherlands, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Sunday.

President Daniel Ortega’s leftist government is facing mounting diplomatic pressure over what the United States has called a dramatic deterioration of human rights — which has seen the jailing of dozens of political opponents, students and journalists.

“The EU profoundly regrets and rejects this unjustified and unilateral decision,” Borrell said of the expulsion, also expressing “unwavering support” for the Netherlands.

“These hostile, unwarranted actions” would not only effect relations between Nicaragua and EU but would lead to Managua’s further international isolation, said Borrell.

The bloc will respond in a “firm and proportional manner”, he added.

“The current political crisis in Nicaragua should be resolved through genuine dialogue between the government and opposition.”

The European Union’s envoy, Bettina Muscheidt, left Nicaragua Saturday a day after the authorities there declared her persona non grata.

Managua cut ties with the Dutch government on Friday evening, describing The Hague as “interventionist” and “neocolonialist” after its ambassador, Christine Pirenne, said her country would not fund the construction of a hospital."

1065768466,20221003,"LONDON: Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has given seven of its landing slots at London’s Heathrow Airport — one of the world’s most important and busiest airports — to two foreign airlines.

According to the details available with Geo TV, PIA allowed six flight slots at the London Heathrow Airport to Turkish Airlines, while it gave one slot to Kuwait Airways for a period of six months. After the ban on PIA flights by the European Union, PIA has entered into an agreement with foreign airlines for landing slots at London’s Heathrow Airport.

PIA’s CEO and Chief Commercial Officer are in Istanbul to finalise the deal and PIA’s slots will be secured once the deal is signed. According to sources, London Heathrow Airport had asked PIA to cancel its expensive landing slots as they were not being used due to the ban.

In order to secure its slots, the PIA management had started discussions with other airlines — the national carrier wanted to temporarily transfer its minimum mandatory 7 slots to other airlines.

Cancellation of flight slots would have affected PIA’s future operations at London’s Heathrow Airport and forced the airline to move to second-tier airports Gatwick or Luton. According to the PIA spokesperson, Heathrow Airport slots are of great importance to PIA and it was crucial to make them operational through babysitting. “We have given them under the babysitting concept for six months and will get them back once the flight operation starts”.

He further said that Aviation Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique was personally monitoring the matter. The European Union and British authorities had banned all Pakistani airlines, including PIA, on the pilot license issue. The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority has not been able to satisfy the European and British authorities despite the passage of two and a half years."
1065775509,20221003,"Lack of action has allowed Greece to build a dark system of pushbacks, surveillance and other fundamental rights violations.

In a small office in the University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Pavlos Pavlidis, coroner for the Evros region, rifled through boxes of personal belongings found on individuals who perished while attempting to cross the Greek-Turkish land border. The air was heavy as we looked at the sealed plastic bags containing wedding rings, lighters, cigarettes and little pieces of paper with bled-out ink, which once belonged to those who desperately sought a better future.

Since 2000, Dr Pavlidis has single-handedly created a DNA-database of 550 refugees and migrants who lost their lives in the Evros river or the mountains of this border region. He expects there are far more who have never been located. His aim, he told us, is to identify the body and find the family members of the deceased. ‘It’s all about respect,’ he said. ‘Respect for the victims, for the families and for the sanctity of every human life.’

Respect for human dignity is hard to come by in this tense border region, rife with inflammatory rhetoric between the Greek and Turkish authorities and ever-mounting evidence of illegal pushbacks to Turkey. In mid-August, reports surfaced of a group of migrants left stranded for days on an islet in the Evros river, as neither of the two countries would assume responsibility for their rescue.

As Green members of the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), we felt compelled to visit the region. This was not only due to the continued pushbacks and fundamental-rights violations at the border, but also the deployment of mass-surveillance technologies and the mounting pressures on civil-society organisations and journalists in Greece who try to bring these practices to light.

What we encountered during our mission was a country building, very deliberately and overtly, a system of deterrence and lies, while still receiving large sums of European Union funding for reception centres. Pushbacks—the most egregious violation of the right to asylum by removing persons from the territory—are happening systematically, in the Aegean Sea and the Evros region. Deportation has become the norm.

The Greek government has faced little EU scrutiny for its flagrant defiance of fundamental rights. As a result, it is becoming increasingly confident in its unlawful model of asylum management, which is resonating with other member states that refuse to show solidarity and remain silent in the face of these rights violations. Journalists and civil-society activists in Greece cite intimidation and a climate of hostility when trying to investigate what is really going on.

We call on the European Commission to ensure basic human dignity and compliance with EU laws, including the right to asylum, in Greece. The commission has the tools to start infringement proceedings, based on the many reports of violations from credible organisations, yet inexcusably chooses not to do so. We urgently need EU migration and border-control funding to be rendered conditional on the upholding of fundamental rights. It is absurd that EU taxpayers’ money is used to fund practices that violate these rights. This is why, during our visit, we launched our campaign urging the EU to stop paying for pushbacks.

Pushback incidents implicate not only the Greek authorities but also raise serious concerns about the role of Frontex, the EU border-control agency. Frontex has been promising improvements in compliance with fundamental rights after reports, including from the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), confirming allegations of serious misconduct, mismanagement and complicity by the agency in rights violations. Yet we do not see this translated into practice in Greece.

Frontex officers in the Evros region operate under the command and control of the Greek authorities, which send them to specific areas based on operational needs. This chain-of-command structure is highly problematic, as fundamental rights do not factor into these deployment decisions.

The Greek government has been reported as saying that so far this year more than 150,000 arrivals have been ‘averted’. This begs the question as to whether Frontex officers are deployed in the right areas and whether their presence has any benefit when it comes to rights protection.

For over a year now, we as members of the LIBE committee have been calling on Frontex to apply due diligence and evaluate its activities in Greece in this light. If the agency cannot fulfil its mandate on fundamental rights, it should suspend its operations to avoid being complicit in violations.

The Greek asylum system is rife with practices that blatantly deny access to asylum procedures or cajole individuals more subtly to move on to other countries. Legal-aid workers share disconcerting stories of clients unable to gain access to the asylum-application platform—which is fully booked until September 2023.

A day after we visited the registration and identification centre of Fylakio, where minors and families were huddled behind prison-like barbed wire, we saw those same fences again. This time they were on a huge screen in the state-of-the-art surveillance control room of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum. We have asked the commission to provide clarity on the level of EU funding such technologies have received and how rights compliance—including protection of personal data—is being ensured.

We are left after our mission to Greece with the distinct impression that the fundamental rights of migrants and refugees are being violated, mass surveillance is growing—even after the recent Predator spyware scandal—and the rule of law is under serious threat. The tireless work of investigative journalists, civil-society actors and individuals such as the coroner Pavlidis offers a thin beacon of light in an increasingly dark arena.

As MEPs we shall continue to do all we can to support their fearless fight to uphold the fundamental values on which the EU was founded. But they should not be left to fight alone: this is a common task for the union. The continued lack of solidarity and fair responsibility-sharing among member states is fuelling the systematic violations we see along the EU’s external borders. This also prevents member states from credibly speaking out.

So long as member states cling to the untenable country-of-first-entry asylum principle of the Dublin regulation, this inhumane and unworkable system will continue its downward spiral. What we need now is firm commitment to equitable sharing of responsibility. Without this, all violations at the union’s borders will be our common legacy—and our collective shame."

• The AU has condemned the “unconstitutional change of government” in Burkina Faso.
• They alleged that the leader had failed to fight jihadist attacks in the west African country.

The African Union on Saturday condemned the “unconstitutional change of government” in Burkina Faso, a day after the second coup this year in the deeply poor and restive West African country.

Junior officers toppled a junta leader on Friday, saying he had failed to fight jihadist attacks in the country.

“The chairperson calls upon the military to immediately and totally refrain from any acts of violence or threats to the civilian population, civil liberties, human rights,” the AU said in a statement, calling for the restoration of the constitutional order by July 2024.

AU chief Moussa Faki Mahamat said he was deeply concerned about the resurgence of unconstitutional ousters in the West African nation and elsewhere on the continent.

In Burkina Faso’s capital, Ouagadougou, an uneasy calm reigned as soldiers in armoured vehicles and pickup trucks guarded the national television centre but traffic slowly resumed on arterial roads.

Shops slowly started reopening in the dusty and spread-out city, where pre-dawn gunfire on Friday around the presidential palace culminated in the latest coup, that drew wide condemnation.

The Economic Community of West African States regional bloc “condemned in the strongest possible terms” the latest seizure of power, calling it “inappropriate” at a time when progress was being made for a return to constitutional order by 1 July 2024.

Burkina Faso’s former colonial ruler France told its citizens in Ouagadougou, believed to number between 4 000 and 5 000, to stay home, while the European Union expressed “concern” at the unfolding events.

The United States called “for a return to calm and restraint by all actors”.

Just before 20:00 on Friday, more than a dozen soldiers in fatigues appeared on the state television and radio broadcaster to announce the removal of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba.

“We have decided to take our responsibilities, driven by a single ideal: the restoration of security and integrity of our territory,” they said.

“Damiba failed. Since he came to power, the zones that were peaceful were attacked. He took power but then he betrayed us,” Habibata Rouamba, a trader and activist said on Saturday.

With much of the Sahel region battling a growing Islamist insurgency, the violence has prompted a series of coups in Mali, Guinea and Chad since 2020.

In January, Damiba installed himself as leader of the country of 16 million after accusing elected president Roch Marc Christian Kabore of failing to beat back the jihadists.

But with more than 40 percent of the country outside government control, the latest putsch leaders said Damiba, too, had failed.

“Far from liberating the occupied territories, the once-peaceful areas have come under terrorist control,” the new military leaders said.

They then suspended the constitution, sealed the borders, dissolved the transitional government and legislative assembly and instituted a 21:00 to 05:00 curfew.

New strongman Traore was previously head of anti-jihadist special forces unit “Cobra” in the northern region of Kaya.

In the morning, shots rang out in the Ouaga 2000 neighbourhood, which houses both the presidential and junta headquarters.

State television was cut for several hours prior to the military announcement, broadcasting just a blank screen with the message “no video signal”.

Though Damiba had promised to make security his priority when he took charge on 24 January, violent attacks have increased since March.

In the north and east, towns have been blockaded by insurgents who have blown up bridges and attacked supply convoys.

As in bordering countries, insurgents affiliated with Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group have stoked unrest.

Thousands have died and about two million have been displaced by the fighting since 2015 when the insurgency spread to Burkina Faso, which has since become the epicentre of the violence across the Sahel.

In September, a particularly bloody month, Damiba sacked his defence minister and assumed the role himself.

Earlier this week, suspected jihadists attacked a convoy carrying supplies to the town of Djibo in the north of the country. The government said 11 soldiers died and around 50 civilians were missing."
1065776551,20221003,"“Literally,” President Joe Biden said at a Democratic fundraiser last week, “there’s a case being made around the world, not just here, because democracy and autocracy.” That wasn’t even a sentence, but you get the idea. He continued, “You just saw what’s happened in Italy in that election. You’re seeing what’s happening around the world. The reason I bother to say that is, you can’t be sanguine about what’s happening here either.”

In insinuating that democracy is under attack because of a healthy democratic election result, Biden was not just spouting his typical divisive rhetoric. He was leveling a direct insult at a foreign ally — Giorgia Meloni, the conservative Italian politician. Meloni, having worked through the democratic process and won an impressive majority in last month’s election, will be Italy’s next prime minister. Biden wasted no time weakening America’s standing in the world to score a few cheap political points when he insulted her before meeting her. Perhaps Biden feels there are too many world leaders still willing to take his phone calls .

Not that the word ""fascist"" still means anything — Biden has called everyone who disagrees with him a ""semi-fascist"" — but Meloni is not a fascist in any meaningful sense of the word. Her party’s economic and social programs do not resemble those of Italy's long-gone and unlamented Fascist regime. Even the claim that her party ""has roots in Fascism"" is a stretch — it could have been applied just as easily to Silvio Berlusconi, and for exactly the same reasons (the now-defunct party involving some former fascists, which also used a torch as its symbol, merged with Berlusconi's party more than a decade ago). But Meloni, a single mother with an inspirational life story and a sharp tongue, is seen as a much greater threat to the Left than the clownish Berlusconi ever was. Meloni is therefore the one who receives the honor of their “f-bombs.”

We will start worrying about fascism the moment Meloni invades Abyssinia, changes Italian pronouns, declares a one-party state, or crosses the Alps to meet with Hitler. Until then, American journalists should stop showing how lazy they are with all the “Mussolini” comparisons.

In reality, Meloni seems relatively friendly to U.S. interests for a right-leaning European. On domestic issues, she talks like a typical mainstream conservative Republican from any time since the 1980s. On foreign policy, she is far less extreme than the average European rightist. Meloni is solidly opposed to Vladimir Putin and his naked, unprovoked aggression against Ukraine. She intends to keep Italy involved in that struggle. She is far more pro-European than most other European right-wing movements nowadays, both inside and outside of her own country.

Meloni supports staying within the Eurozone and remaining part of NATO. She is appropriately adversarial toward China, whose poses a genuine threat — which is to say, not like the pretend threats that Biden talks about.

In all of these respects, Meloni’s program seems considerably less extreme in its own context, and considerably less threatening to American interests, than that of her junior coalition partner, former Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.

The idea that Biden would insult the new leader of the European Union's third-largest country without knowing anything about her, and before even meeting with her, is just one more self-inflicted embarrassment upon himself and his country.

Sadly, the English-speaking world is decades beyond the point where the word ""fascism"" had any sort of meaning. Biden has been working especially hard to demonstrate this with his domestic campaign rhetoric.

Having already tried to brand parents as domestic terrorists for daring to object to grave problems with their local education systems, Biden recently delivered a speech featuring members of the military in the background, calling everyone who opposes him a threat to democracy. If you want to know what actual fascistic behavior looks like, Biden's speech was it.

Biden, unlike Meloni, is doing what authoritarians frequently do — citing a public incident (for Biden, it’s the 2021 Capitol riot; for others, it was the Reichstag fire) as pretext for an authoritarian crackdown against political opponents.

Biden’s behavior — between this and his recent, flagrant — is a direct attack on democracy itself. And considering his misuse of the military in that blood-red-background speech, leaders at the Pentagon should be thinking carefully about just how far they are willing to follow his orders.

Voters should also consider this as they watch Biden humiliate their country on the world stage. A president who talks so much smack about fascism, even at the expense of national unity and foreign policy goals, is probably just projecting."

1065783845,20221003,"New Delhi [India], October 3 (ANI/NewsVoir): For the very best pasta, pastries, biscuits, tarts and flatbreads, you need the perfect dough.

And for the perfect dough, it's crucial to have the highest quality flour-after all: Flour is the most important ingredient!

Pure Flour from Europe is exactly that: he highest quality flour available. From the careful growing of the wheat until its harvest, the safety of its milling and storage, to its packaging and transport to grocers' shelves all over the world. Pure Flour from Europe is the safe, reliable, and delicious choice.

Whichever recipe you choose, whichever type of dough you need, Pure Flour from Europe will make it as perfect as any dough could be. And the perfect dough makes the perfect pasta, pastries, pies, tarts, flatbreads and so much more.

For fresh pasta, flour is mixed with water or egg-whichever you choose, the resulting dough needs to be supple, firm, and cook up to a slightly chewy, very tender noodle: excellent for whatever your pasta needs might be...

When making pastry for pies, tarts, biscuits or pastries, you will most likely be mixing your beautiful flour with a fat.

For pancakes, flatbreads, and tender-crumbed yeast breads, the liquid you mix in will vary: whether eggs, yogurt, fat or water. But one thing remains the same: from the tenderest pancake, to the flakiest paratha, the puffiest naan, or chewiest pizza dough, Pure Flour from Europe is always your best choice.

With its soft pure powdery texture, Pure Flour from Europe has no bits of grit or uneven grains, so your dough will be smooth, tender, and soft (though never flabby-good dough always needs good structure, which is what good flour provides).

And it's not simply the texture and consistency of flour that makes a dough perfect. The best flour delivers a subtle flavour of the flour/wheat itself. When you are biting into a sweet biscuit, or savouring a forkful of pasta, it is there, rounding out the flavour of your dough with a satisfying taste and illusive elegance.

• None A very high response rate, reaching 92.5% of responders, from three months in this subpopulation and up to 100% responders when cholesterol levels at baseline exceeded 160 mg/dl.
• None In addition, new data confirming the multi-targeted intestinal and hepatic mode of action of TOTUM•070 in preclinical and human studies will be presented at the upcoming American Heart Association Annual Meeting.
• None TOTUM•070, a patented plant-based active substance, without phytosterols or red yeast rice, now has a strong record of clinical and scientific evidence supporting its commercial application.
• None Backed by market studies1, the Company confirms its objective of marketing the product by the first half of 2024 at the latest and is intensifying its discussions with major players in the health and nutrition sectors.

Valbiotis (FR0013254851 – ALVAL, PEA/SME eligible) (Paris:ALVAL), a Research and Development company committed to scientific innovation for preventing and combating metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, presents additional positive results from the Phase II HEART clinical study with TOTUM•070 for hypercholesterolemia. In the commercially targeted population with cholesterol levels above 130 mg/dl at randomization, TOTUM•070 reduced blood LDL cholesterol levels by 13.7% at 3 months and by 14.3% at 6 months, compared to placebo, with a very high response rate. In parallel, Valbiotis has obtained new data confirming the intestinal and hepatic mode of action of this active substance, in preclinical and human studies, which will be presented at the next American Heart Association Annual Meeting. With this solid clinical and scientific package for TOTUM•070, backed up by market studies1, the Company has validated its objective of commercialization by the first half of 2024 at the latest and is intensifying its exchanges with major players in the health and nutrition sectors.

Prof. Jean-Marie BARD, professor of biochemistry and hospital pharmacy practitioner at the University Hospital of Nantes and the Institut de Cancérologie de l'Ouest (ICO), scientific advisor of the HEART study, comments: ""The analysis of the additional data from the HEART study reinforces the initial positive results previously announced. With these more precise data, focused on the final target population, TOTUM•070 is particularly effective for people with blood LDL cholesterol levels above 130 mg/dl. The magnitude of the reduction in LDL cholesterol, its rapidity and maintenance over time, with a high response rate, are excellent results, especially for a non-drug product. The HEART study now clearly demonstrates the efficacy of TOTUM•070 for people with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia, for whom pharmaceutical treatments are not recommended, in the prevention of cardiovascular risk.""

Additional positive results from the HEART clinical study in the final target population

The Phase II HEART clinical study was a multi-center, international, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study involving 120 people with untreated mild to moderate LDL hypercholesterolemia. The participants were divided into 2 equivalent arms of 60 people, supplemented for 6 months with a daily dose of 5 g of TOTUM•070 or a placebo, in two intakes. The first positive results were announced on June 13, 2022 (press release of June 13, 2022).

Of the 120 volunteers included in the study, 84 had blood LDL cholesterol levels greater than 130 mg/dl at randomization, which is the commercially targeted population for TOTUM•070.

In this population, TOTUM•070 showed increased efficacy on blood LDL cholesterol levels, with a 13.7% reduction obtained at 3 months and 14.3% at 6 months compared to placebo. Blood triglyceride levels were reduced by 14.3% at 3 months and 14.4% at 6 months, compared to placebo. Also in this population, the data show a very high response rate, with 92.5% of volunteers responding at 3 months. This rate even reached 100% when the cholesterol level at inclusion exceeded 160 mg/dl.

Furthermore, in the overall study population, stratified analysis showed that the magnitude of the reduction in blood LDL cholesterol was significantly correlated with the level of LDL cholesterol at baseline: TOTUM•070 was more effective the higher the initial cholesterol level.

New data on the multi-targeted intestinal and hepatic mode of action of TOTUM•070 selected by the American Heart Association Annual Meeting

Following the first mode of action data already published, extensive preclinical work explored the specific action of TOTUM•070 at the intestinal level. This work first demonstrated effects on the abundance and diversity of the intestinal microbiota, as well as on bacteria known to be involved in the regulation of metabolism, which could help explain the effects of TOTUM•070. Other studies have also confirmed and documented the effect of TOTUM•070 on intestinal cholesterol absorption, one of the main levers of action on hypercholesterolemia. They will be presented at the next annual meeting of the American Heart Association in November 2022.

At the hepatic level, the clinical mode of action study, which had previously reported positive results (press release of March 29, 2022), has delivered additional results at the molecular level2. RNA sequencing analyses demonstrate that TOTUM•070 metabolites modulate a large number of genes involved in the regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid and lipoprotein metabolism in human liver cells. These molecular data confirm the effect of TOTUM•070 on human liver cells and provide additional information on the hepatic mechanisms of action of TOTUM•070. These additional results will also be presented at the AHA meeting in November 2022.

Murielle CAZAUBIEL, Director of Medical, Regulatory and Industrial Affairs and member of the Valbiotis Board of Directors, comments: ""The additional clinical efficacy results from the HEART study are excellent for TOTUM•070. With all the preclinical and clinical studies conducted, we now have a very robust level of evidence to support the value and positioning of TOTUM•070 against excess LDL cholesterol in the frame of cardiovascular risk prevention.""

Sébastien BESSY, Director of Marketing and Commercial Operations and member of the Board of Directors, adds: ""The commercial potential of TOTUM•070 is clearly supported by the market studies1 we have conducted with consumers and doctors in various international markets. This backs up our ambitious objectives of commercialization by the first half of 2024 at the latest, and of intensifying exchanges with major players in the health and nutrition sectors.""

Issuing a statement, Ursula von der Leyen noted that at a time of unprecedented challenges faced by the people of Sri Lanka, the European Union remains committed to support Sri Lanka’s efforts to overcome the crisis successfully, including the necessary reforms that will bring the country back to a path of inclusive prosperity and lasting national reconciliation.

She further stated that in this process, freedom of expression and assembly, dialogue among all stakeholders, as well as respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights will remain essential.

She has also made a reference to the assessment by the European Union on the progress made by Sri Lanka on GSP+ commitments. Accordingly, the European Union will assess the progress made on Sri Lanka’s GSP+ commitments very soon.

The report is scheduled to be released towards the latter part of this year or early 2023.

She also commended the success in the efforts to introduce and steer policies that will ensure the short and long-term interests of all Sri Lankans and address the devastating efforts of the unprecedented economic downturn as well as the negotiations with international financial institutions and creditors.

1065789664,20221003,"A transect walk from Tima Town, headquarters of the Gola Forest National Park (GFNP) in Gbarpolu County, showcasing the richness of the forest of Liberia.

The transect to the boundary of the National Park cuts across a stretch of the community forest and farmlands. As one approaches the buffer to the park, the forest thickens, as its volume increases in a canopy of full-size timbers and young understory trees and shrubs, punctuating its richness.

Going further, the canopy is broken by a 20-acre land, in the middle of the forest, four kilometers from Tima and about one kilometer to the boundary of the park, which was recently cleared and burned. This is called ‘forest land dis virgin for agriculture.

The owners of the new farm are a young couple, who seemed unperturbed seeing the visiting team, or noticing any unpleasant reaction, although professing that they are aware that the boundary of the National Park is not far from their new farm. The creation of a hole in the heart of the forest is painful. It destroys the ecosystem by creating a mosaic of farmlands causing the forest to disconnect, leading to fragmentation.

The act negates the benefits inherent in avoiding deforestation to reduce leakage which demonstrates Liberia’s readiness to combat global climate change.

Educating local communities in sustainable farming practices is crucial for reducing deforestation and preserving the ecosystem of the National Park. The Forestry Development Authority (FDA) of Liberia and the Society for the Conservation of Nature of Liberia (SCNL, BirdLife partner) place a high value on community participation in Land Use Planning around the Gola Forest National Park and in Community Forests.

The European Union-funded project PAPFoR in the Gola Landscape of Liberia and Sierra Leone supports Land Use Planning in critical conservation areas as one of its major components. The objective is to work closely with the communities to promote sustainable farming while conserving the rainforest.

The project ensures that the Gola landscape is managed effectively by a cross-border partnership between governments, civil society, and communities through participatory land use planning, training of locals in establishing and managing community forestry, and effective community participation in conservation by implementing a co-management approach mechanism in conserving the Gola Forest National Park.

“With the support of community leaders and residents, we can ensure the long-term protection of the forests, through massive awareness, uphold the rights of the communities, safeguard critical habitats for endangered species, and help secure the livelihoods of the thousands of people who directly depend on this beautiful ecosystem. The Forest is the asset and future of the people, let’s embrace wise use of forest lands for the better of us all,” said James P. Mulbah, PAPFor Project Coordinator in the country.

Active participation of community leaders in promoting sustainable land practices will not only provide multiple benefits but will further improve the capacity of the communities to lay claim on ownership of land use management systems for now and in the future."
1065793297,20220926,"MOSCOW (Reuters) – Russian manufacturing activity grew at its fastest rate in 3-1/2 years in September, driven by rises in production, new orders and client demand, a business survey showed on Monday, though Western sanctions continued to weigh on export business.

The S&P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose in September to 52.0 from 51.7 in the previous month, climbing higher above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction to its highest point since March 2019.

“Client demand was focused on domestic customers, however, as new export orders declined steeply,” S&P Global said in a monthly survey. “The decrease in foreign client demand was attributed to the loss of customers and the impact of sanctions.”

The United States and European Union last week promised to impose more sanctions on Moscow after Russia staged referendums in four Ukrainian regions and later declared that it was annexing them.

Western governments and Kyiv said the move was a breach of international law.

Employment rose at the fastest pace since January, which firms attributed to greater production requirements and a rise in new order inflows.

It was not clear how heavily President Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation order, made on Sept. 21, had weighed on workforce numbers. Tens of thousands of men have been drafted into the army or have fled abroad since then.

The same could be said for sentiment about future output, which rose in September to its highest since March 2019.

“Greater optimism reportedly stemmed from new product development, greater import substitution and hopes of an uptick in client demand,” S&P Global said."

The EU also said the fighting has reportedly left ""tens of thousands"" of people newly displaced and caused widespread damage to civilian property and infrastructure.

In a statement the block released through its Commission for Crisis Management, the EU confirmed reports that ""the supply of humanitarian commodities and fuel as well as cash availability are still totally blocked for Tigray"". Humanitarian access is also ""greatly impeded in all affected areas in Amhara and Afar.""

EU's statement came a day after the USAID said categorized ""northern Ethiopia"" as ""one of the most dangerous locations in the world for aid workers who risk their lives to protect people in need.""

According to the EU, humanitarian organizations had to suspend their operations and withdraw some staff from conflict-affected areas.

On Friday, Junior officers overthrew Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba who, in January, installed himself as leader of the country of 16 million after accusing elected president Roch Marc Christian Kabore of failing to beat back the jihadists.

As soldiers took over state TV on Friday evening they said 34-year-old Captain Ibrahim Traore was in charge.

In the capital, Ouagadougou people have been reacting to the latest political development to hit Burkina Faso.

Local resident, Francois Kaboré, said: ""He could no longer manage the security issue. Many people died and more and more criminals approached the big cities. So, many people were not happy with that.""

Another citizen, Alidou Pitroipa, felt it was not the way to resolve disagreements with political leaders.

It has also urged the consulates of the Member States in Russia to assess the conditions under which Russian citizens can be issued Schengen visas in a restrictive and coordinated manner. This information is revealed from a news report published by Schengen Visa.

According to the Commission, the updated guidelines are necessary after the number of Russian citizens travelling to the EU has increased due to the “recent escalation of the war by Russia, including through military mobilization and sham ‘referenda’.”

Commenting on the guidelines, the Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, reiterated the importance of unity between the Member States in order to deal with the rising number of Russian citizens reaching the EU and Schengen Area borders.

“The European Union is and will always remain a place of asylum. But this is now first and foremost a security issue: increased scrutiny on visa issuance and heightened border checks will ensure we protect ourselves, and our unity,” he said. Whereas Swedish politician Ylva Johansson, who also serves as the Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson warned the Member States that the security threat from Russia’s aggression is real, and that the EU must protect itself and its citizens.

“We are making sure to have a coherent and united approach at EU external borders vis-à-vis Russian citizens and also when it comes to applying strict rules on issuing short-stay visas for Russian citizens. At the same time, Europe will not close its door to those who are in genuine need of protection,” she said.

The guidelines mainly urge the Member States to reinforce security scrutiny on visa issuance to Russians while also telling the EU consulates in Russia to reassess all visas issued to Russian citizens that are currently valid. According to the guidelines, when reviewing applications for Schengen Visas, the Member States should assess the conditions under which a visa can be issued in a restrictive and coordinated manner, including here for Russians fleeing military mobilization. However, in cases when visa applicants intend to stay in the EU for a longer period, the Member States’ consulates should treat the case under the applicable national rules for national long-stay visas.

“When it comes to short-stay visas, consulates are called to apply any humanitarian derogations in a restrictive manner. It is up to the Member States, based on an individual examination, to assess if applications by Russian citizens can qualify as falling under the humanitarian reasons category,” the Commission advises.

Regarding the reassessment of visas already issued, the Member States are instructed to adopt a strict reassessing approach, reminding them that the border guards of any of the Member States have the right to revoke a visa of a person that shows up at that country’s external borders.

The Commission also calls on the Member States to reinforce security checks at the external border and to cooperate with each other in order to prevent Russian citizens who are denied entry at one EU border point from entering from another border point. Passenger carriers are also urged to carefully asses the travel documents of travellers, in particular, Russian citizens."

• EBRD to help MÁDARA Group improve its new B2B beauty platform, selfnamed.com
• New platform to boost access to sustainable beauty products and reduce CO emissions
• MÁDARA is the first SME in the Baltic states to benefit from EBRD support

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is helping MÁDARA Cosmetics Group, Latvia’s leading manufacturer of organic, sustainable beauty products, to strengthen its new business model and contribute to a sustainable beauty market.

The Bank will assist the company in improving its new business-to-business white-label beauty product platform, which will reduce energy use and the CO emissions associated with product development and delivery. MÁDARA is the first SME in the Baltic states to benefit from EBRD support and the initiative will be funded by the European Union (EU)’s Horizon 2020 programme.

Through its subsidiary, Cosmetics NORD, MÁDARA has launched a new self-service platform, www.selfnamed.com, which aims to make circular and clean beauty available across Europe and to create eco-conscious white-label cosmetic products on demand, through an innovative print-on-demand business model. With fast lead times and no minimum order quantity, the platform makes sustainable skincare products more available and reduces over-production.

As part of its support package, the EBRD will finance improvements to the selfnamed.com platform and enhance the digitalisation of the business model. New drop-shipping functionality and the integration of selfnamed.com with ecommerce platforms such as Shopify and WooCommerce will help reduce transport CO emissions and lower entry costs for new brands, as products can be shipped directly from the manufacturer to the end customer. A mock-up generator will allow customers’ individual designs to be placed automatically on product images, doing away with the need for printing samples and photo shoots, reducing resources and costs.

MÁDARA Cosmetics Group’s warehouse facilities, powered fully by green electricity, will be used for its storage and drop-shipping activities, further reducing the firm’s carbon footprint.

The EBRD is committed to helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to achieve sustainable resource efficiency and to innovate in three areas vital to the economies in which the Bank invests: energy, water and materials. Through its Green Innovation Programme (GIP), funded by Horizon 2020, the EBRD helps firms in the EU-12 countries conduct research, development and deployment activities, as well as invest in products, technologies and business models that have a positive green economy transition impact.

“We are delighted that MÁDARA Cosmetics Group has become the first SME in the Baltic region to benefit from EBRD support,” said Ian Brown, EBRD Associate Director and Head of the Baltic States. “Its commitment to sustainability mirrors the Bank’s own ethos, and we are happy to help MÁDARA Cosmetics Group become even more green and digital. Our joint work will enable the more efficient use of resources for MÁDARA Cosmetics Group and its clients, while also contributing to a greener and more efficient beauty industry.”

“We are pleased to partner with the EBRD, an organisation whose commitment to sustainability matches our own,” said Uldis Iltners, CEO of MÁDARA Cosmetics Group. “The EBRD’s support will enable us to strengthen our new business model and increase access to circular and clean beauty for everyone in Europe and beyond.”

The EBRD has been working in Latvia since the country regained its independence in the early 1990s. To date, the Bank has invested almost €1 billion in the country through 99 projects."

""We are eager for internationalization. And we are on the right path. Starting this year, we are part of the European group of university alliances, the EU Green European Network, as a full member, not as an associate member, together with eight universities from Ireland, Poland, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Sweden, universities that promote European values and the European identity. EU Green is revolutionizing the quality and competitiveness of the member universities. The alliance reflects the ambition of the European Union to build the European space of education,"" stated rector Constantin Bunga, told Agerpres.

He stated that, in this way, the Oradea university acquired a European certification, a guarantee for quality and prestige. At the same time, this alliance of universities benefits from priority access to European funding, for strategic projects 2022-2029, both for research and for university management.

""It positions us, implicitly Oradea and Bihor, on the international arena. It provides greater visibility and any investor in the region will approach with respect the triplet of enterprises - university - local governance. It expands the collaborations of our university and its partners at all levels. We become a university more competitive, more attractive for the third countries of Europe, a point of reference for innovative cooperation. We will be a creator of knowledge through European teams to face the great societal challenges,"" argued Constantin Bungau.

• After the balance sheet date, raised CHF 1.25 million in financing with sophisticated investors.

ZURICH, Switzerland, Oct. 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LR – Achiko AG (SIX: ACHI; OTCQB: ACHKF; ISIN CH0522213468) (“Achiko”, the “Company”) is pleased to announce its financial results for the period of six months to June 30, 2022, and its progress since then which can be found at https://www.achiko.com/financials.

In the first half of 2022, Achiko AG has confirmed that calibration testing of its affordable non-invasive Covid-19 saliva-based rapid test technology, AptameX™, indicated the system’s ability to deliver a >97% sensitive and >97% specific rapid test at a wider range of viral loads than most other rapid tests.

“The ability to offer healthcare professionals a practical alternative to PCR tests and less accurate antigen based rapid tests has been a major driver for Achiko’s research and clinical development teams to produce the world’s first scale application using DNA aptamers in a commercial diagnostic setting,” said Mr. Steven Goh, CEO of Achiko. “The use of differentiated chemistry to develop a range of non-invasive, highly accurate, and cost-effective rapid tests with Achiko’s AptameX™ technology, positions the Company at the leading edge of diagnostic development moving forward.”

Despite another challenging period for the Company, it has made significant progress with its initial commercial application of its AptameX™ technology and expects to be generating significant revenue from AptameX™ in Indonesia in the final quarter of 2022.

Commercialization in Indonesia and Beyond

A key focus of operations during the reporting period was to progress the Company’s efforts to successfully launch a scalable test product in Indonesia. As part of this, the Company completed its pre-sales validation process in Indonesia with first generation test kits and identified a range of improvements that are being incorporated into its second-generation product. Key materials are now being produced in Taiwan and scale plastics and assembly being undertaken in Indonesia.

In April, the Company signed a major marketing and sales agreement with Pengurus Wilayah Nahdlatul Ulama DKI Jakarta (PWNU), the Jakarta District of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the largest Islamic organization in the world, located primarily in Indonesia. The agreement provides for the supply and delivery of aptamer-based diagnostics, first to its Jakarta branch of over 4 million members, and on success, to the larger membership of over 90 million registered members. At the same time, the Company signed an updated agreement with PT Indofarma TbK (Indofarma) to use its sister digital passporting service Teman SehatTM (“Health Buddy”) as a telehealth platform for its diagnostic services. Indofarma is one of Indonesia’s oldest pharmaceutical companies (part owned by the Government). It supplies over 13,000 pharmacies, 4,000 hospitals, and 9,000 health facilities. It also conducts testing in over one hundred airports and is a national manufacturer of medical devices and the National Contract Research Organization.

In May, the Company successfully registered AptameX™ under the European Union Medical Device Research and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation and obtained a CE Mark that grants it access to 27 countries in the European Union for its Covid-19 AptameX™ test and system.

Financial Results

Achiko concluded the first half of 2022 with an operating loss of USD $2.4 million in comparison to a loss of USD $4.6 million in the first half of 2021. The Company reduced its expense base in Switzerland and focused its development efforts through one primary research and development team.

The ability to manage costs with a reduced footprint has been important during a challenging period for the Company. Delays with completing the full year accounts and subsequent audit took up a considerable amount of management time and attention and contributed to the Company’s delay to raise sufficient finance in time to launch and scale production in Indonesia as planned before the end of the period. 



Post balance date, the Company has completed CHF 1.25 million in financing by a number of sophisticated investors. Funds are being applied to launching and scaling commercialization efforts in Indonesia and beyond and bringing the Company towards good standing.

Steven Goh commented: “We are grateful to our shareholders and our partners for their help and support and look forward to a brighter finish to 2022 and beyond.”

AptameX™: Product Development, Sales, and Market Outlook

“Achiko’s core objective is to bring access to better, more affordable, and accurate diagnostics,” Goh added. “With its AptameX™ technology, the Company is well placed to take advantage of major healthcare trends including delivering increasingly accurate diagnosis at Point of Care by non-invasive means and using technology to deliver rapid results in real time.” AptameX™ offers public health assurance through early detection by regularly using a telehealth platform for diagnostics equipped with the latest technological diagnostic tests that are comfortable, accurate and affordable.

Despite delays in production to meet forecast demand, the outlook for AptameX™ in Indonesia remains encouraging and the Company expects to be producing and delivering over one million tests per month in the final quarter of this calendar year. Samples are also being produced for use in other Asian countries, Europe, and the Middle East.

Corporate Initiatives 

During the Reporting Period, the Company welcomed Mr. Derek Brandt as a Member of its Advisory Board and after balance date farewelled Ms. Carol Aebi. The Company is moving to strengthen its corporate leadership in Finance and other important functions with a series of key executive appointments. Further details shall be released in advance of and as part of the upcoming AGM that will now be held in late October / early November at a date to be announced.

“I am hopeful in a couple of hours we can have a unanimous agreement on the sanctions package,” Andrzej Sados, Poland’s ambassador to the EU, told reporters, as carried by Bloomberg.

“We are very close to it and there is determination to clinch a deal ASAP,” Sados said as the ambassadors to the EU of all 27 member states of the bloc began a meeting to discuss the next package of sanctions against Russia for the latest escalations of its war in Ukraine—sham referendums and the subsequent annexation of four regions in eastern Ukraine.

The package to be discussed is expected to include political backing from the EU on the proposed price cap on Russian oil, the Polish diplomat said.

The EU is looking to reach an agreement on the new sanctions package before an EU leaders’ summit on October 7 in Prague, sources with knowledge of the talks told Bloomberg.

Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented the Commission’s proposals for the eighth package of sanctions in response to Russia’s escalation of the war in Ukraine.

“Today, in this package, here, we are laying the legal basis for this oil price cap,” von der Leyen said, commenting on the G7-led idea of banning Russian crude oil from imports by sea unless the oil is sold at or below a certain price the buyers expect to set.

The eighth package is planned to include further restrictions on trade with Russia.

A sanctions package would need unanimous approval by all 27 EU member states, but Hungary has said it would block new energy sanctions against Russia.

“Efforts must be made to tighten security at Ghana’s territorial boundaries to help check the worrisome situation because sections of the public are still ignorant about issues of terrorists’ insurgence and violent extremism in neighbouring countries,” the Initiative cautioned.

The two-day workshop was on the theme: ‘The Role of CSOs in Ghana’s Border Security Management’, aimed at developing linkages between strengthening the Ghana Border Security Project and the National Security Ministry.

The GII, in collaboration with the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD), organised the forum for 90 stakeholders drawn from selected CSOs, the media, development partners and migration policy makers and implementers.

Mrs Ofori-Kwafo implored the Ministry of National Security to make the engagement an annual national forum to increase collaborations towards effective and efficient border security management and other security related issues, adding that “our borders are porous which makes it vulnerable for cross border crime, terrorist attacks, violent extremism, drug trafficking, illegal trade and smuggling of contraband goods.

“We need to guard our own borders and territorial boundaries to keep the country safe from terrorists’ attacks and violent extremism,” Mrs Ofori-Kwafo decried.

Irchad Razaaly, the European Union Ambassador to Ghana, suggested effective and efficient collaboration among the citizenry, CSOs, and the government security agencies operating along the border communities to maintain the peace, unity and harmony.

The Strengthening Border Security in Ghana (SBS Ghana) project is funded by the European Union Emergency Trust Fund (EUTF) for Africa and implemented by ICMPD in cooperation with the Ghana Immigration Service."
1065838130,20221003,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union and Israel on Monday held high-level talks for the first time in a decade, with the Europeans pressing Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid about how to put a two-state solution to the conflict with the Palestinians into place.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell welcomed the recent support from Lapid — who took part in Monday’s talks by videoconference — for an end to the conflict based on an Israeli and Palestinian state living peacefully side by side.

“This is also what we want to push for. We want the resumption of a political process that can lead to a two-state solution and a comprehensive regional peace,” Borrell said. “We have to explore how we can put this into practice.”

“It’s better to sit and discuss frankly, than to avoid any contact. Certainly we disagree. Certainly we express concern, but I think it’s more positive to sit and discuss,” Borrell told reporters in Brussels.

In his opening remarks at the meeting — led in Brussels by Israeli Intelligence Minister Elazar Stern — Borrell underlined the EU's concern “about the continued tensions and violence on the ground and the continuation of unilateral measures, such as settlement expansion, and the security issues.”

It's the first time the two sides have held an “Association Council” since July 2012. Israel and the EU signed an Association Agreement governing their ties in 1995, and the pact entered force in 2000. Talks were meant to be held annually, but Israel canceled a planned 2013 meeting over the EU’s policy toward Israeli settlements. Some EU countries have also been reluctant to meet since then.

""It is an important milestone in our improving relations. This past year has seen some vast progress in our ties — and there is still so much more that we can do,” he said, according to the speech released by his office.

However, there is no short-term prospect for peace.

Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank is now in its 55th year. The last real peace talks ended in 2009, and critics say growing Israeli settlements in the West Bank and elsewhere undermine any hopes for a two-state solution. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank along with Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, for a future state.

Lapid is serving as caretaker prime minister until a Nov. 1 election, in which he is facing a tough race against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Opinion polls indicate that even if Lapid is able to form a new government, the next parliament, like the current one, will be dominated by hard-line parties that oppose Palestinian statehood.

At the U.N. General Assembly last month, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that “our confidence in achieving a peace based on justice and international law is waning, due to the Israeli occupation policies.”

Speaking a day after Lapid addressed the assembly, Abbas delivered a pessimistic assessment of diplomacy, saying a “frantic campaign to confiscate our lands” persisted in the generations-long dispute, while the military “are killing the Palestinian people in broad daylight” with impunity.

1065842033,20221003,"(Bloomberg) -- The European market for Russia’s seaborne crude is drying up as sanctions draw nearer, and the country’s Asian customers aren’t picking up the slack like they once were.

With just over two months until a European Union ban on seaborne crude imports comes into effect, shipments to the bloc plus the UK are down by about 60% from where they were before Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine.

Customers in northern Europe in particular have slashed their purchases, which are now running below 200,000 barrels a day, down by 1 million from the levels seen at the start of the year.

Meanwhile the diversion of crude flows from Europe to Asia appears to have reached a plateau. Flows to the big three buyers of Russian barrels — China, India and Turkey — which initially stepped in to fill the gap after European buyers started to shun Moscow’s exports, peaked in June at 2.2 million barrels a day. In the four weeks to Sept. 30 that figure was down by about 350,000 barrels a day.

While the volume on tankers yet to show final destinations may narrow that gap, it won’t eliminate it completely.

While total crude flows shipped out of Russia in the week to Sept. 30 edged higher, the four-week average, which smooths out some of the noise in the data, moved in the opposite direction.

A US plan to impose a price cap that would see purchasers granted access to insurance and other essential services only if the price paid is below a yet-to-be-determined threshold, is creating confusion among buyers. Lack of clarity over the level at which the cap will be set, uncertainty over when it will be implemented, and few details on how it will be policed, are leaving would-be purchasers of Russian crude in limbo until the situation is clarified.

Even though Russia has said it won’t sell its oil to anyone who imposes a price cap and its major customers remain unlikely to endorse the plan, the existence of such a mechanism may boost the bargaining power key customers China, India and Turkey have over Russia for future purchases.

On top of this, Russia’s revenues face another headwind from a further drop in export duty rates, which are set to shrink by 15% in October. That will take the per-barrel income to its lowest since February 2021, reflecting both lower international crude prices and a widening discount for Urals against Brent crude during the mid-August to mid-September period.

The Kremlin will seek to offset lower export duty revenues with dividend payments. Shareholders in gas giant Gazprom PJSC, where the Russian state holds a 50% stake, voted at an extraordinary meeting to pay the producer’s first-ever interim dividends.

Overall exports remained below 3 million barrels a day for a third week; that’s the longest period since early March that this measure of shipments has been beneath that threshold. The drop was driven by lower flows to northern Europe, while shipments to Asian markets remained steady.

All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade. These are shipments made by KazTransoil JSC that transit Russia for export through Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk.

The Kazakh barrels are blended with crude of Russian origin to create a uniform export grade. Since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Kazakhstan has rebranded its cargoes to distinguish them from those shipped by Russian companies. Transit crude is specifically exempted from EU sanctions on Russia’s seaborne shipments that are due to come into effect in December.

At 660,000 barrels a day, Russia’s seaborne crude exports to European countries fell to their lowest for the year so far in the four weeks to Sept. 30, dropping by 136,000 barrels a day, or 17%, from the period to Sept. 23. A small increase in flows to buyers in the Black Sea region was more than outweighed by the continuing decline in volumes to northern Europe. These figures do not include shipments to Turkey.

The volume shipped from Russia to northern European countries fell below 200,000 barrels a day on average in the four weeks to Sept. 30. Total shipments to northern Europe and the flow to storage tanks in Rotterdam both set new lows for the year so far.

Exports to Mediterranean countries slipped in the four weeks to Sept. 30, with a drop in shipments to Italy. Flows to Mediterranean countries, including Turkey, which is excluded from the European figures at the top of this section, fell to a seven-week low.

Combined flows to Bulgaria and Romania rose for a second week. Nevertheless flows to Romania, which were running at about 120,000 barrels a day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have slowed to a trickle.

Shipments to Russia’s Asian customers, plus those on vessels showing no final destination, which typically end up in either India or China, rose for a third week, reaching their highest in six weeks. All of the tankers carrying crude to unidentified Asian destinations are signaling Port Said or the Suez Canal, with final discharge points unlikely to be apparent until they have passed through the waterway into the Red Sea, at the earliest. Most of those ships end up in India, though an increasing number have been heading to China in recent weeks.

Aggregate flows of Russian crude increased for a second week, rising by 173,000 barrels a day, or 6%, in the seven days to Sept. 30, compared with the previous week. Flows from the Baltic ports and from the Pacific terminal at Kozmino were up, while Black Sea and Arctic shipments fell. Figures exclude volumes from Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.

Inflows to the Kremlin's war chest from its crude-export duty edged up alongside higher volumes, rising to a four-week high of $162 million in the seven days to Sept. 30. But the four-week average income moved in the opposite direction, dropping to a 13-week low of $145 million.

Export duty rates are falling again in October, dropping by 15% to $6.06 a barrel, taking the per barrel rate to its lowest since February 2021. The drop reflects both a slide in Brent prices and a widening of the discount for Urals against the North Sea benchmark. That discount during the mid-August to mid-September period widened to about $21.50 a barrel, up from about $18.70 a barrel the previous month, according to Bloomberg calculations using figures published by the Russian Ministry of Finance.

The following charts show the number of ships leaving each export terminal and the destinations of crude cargoes from the four export regions.

A total of 31 tankers loaded 22.9 million barrels of Russian crude in the week to Sept. 30, vessel-tracking data and port agent reports show. That’s up by 1.2 million barrels, to a four-week high. Destinations are based on where vessels signal they are heading at the time of writing, and some will almost certainly change as voyages progress. All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.

The total volume of crude on ships loading Russian crude from Baltic terminals was up for a second week, rising by 208,000 barrels a day.

Shipments from Novorossiysk in the Black Sea fell back, giving up part of the gain seen the previous week.

Arctic shipments slipped to a three-week low, with two vessels departing Murmansk in the week to Sept. 30, both heading to Rotterdam.

Crude flows from Russia’s eastern oil terminals edged higher in the week to Sept. 30. Eight cargoes of ESPO and one of Sakhalin Blend crude were loaded, with all but one of the cargoes heading to China. The other ship is yet to show a destination, but is most likely heading for India.

Note: This story forms part of a regular weekly series tracking shipments of crude from Russian export terminals and the export duty revenues earned from them by the Russian government.

Note: All figures have been revised to exclude cargoes owned by Kazakhstan’s KazTransOil JSC, which transit Russia and are shipped from Novorossiysk and Ust-Luga.

1065846490,20221003,"NEW YORK, Oct. 3, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- According to the latest report published by Growth Plus Reports, the global Urinary Drainage Bags Market is expected to clock US$ 2.86 billion by 2030 and to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during the forecast period. This exclusive information is published by Growth Plus Reports in its report titled ""Urinary Drainage Bags Market – Global Outlook & Forecast 2022-2030""

The prevalence of urology-related diseases, such as urinary retention, cystitis, benign prostatic, urine incontinence, etc., is constantly rising. Consequently, there is an increased demand for urinary drainage bags, thus boosting market growth. The increasing geriatric population prone to urinary disorders are preferring the use of urinary drainage bags as these are quite economical and convenient to use. Additionally, the increase in hospital admissions for the treatment of chronic diseases has enhanced the demand for products that provide effective patient care throughout the hospital stay.

The global market for urinary drainage bags on the basis of products is grouped into:

The leg bag segment holds the majority of market share, attributed to factors that the leg bags allow free movements and are convenient to use. Additionally, leg bags are available in a variety of forms, which allows the patient to choose the product suitable to their need. Furthermore, the large drainage bags segment is anticipated to show lucrative growth in the forecast as majority of it use is in hospital and healthcare units.

According to usage, the global urinary bags market is bifurcated into:

The disposable segment has dominated the market, mainly due to high demand for patient care in hospitals and stationary healthcare settings. Additionally, the disposable bags segment is anticipated to grow further in the forecast period due to their affordability, and lower risk of infection transmissions.

The urinary drainage bags market is divided into two segments based on capacity:

The market has been dominated by 500-1000 ml bags. The 500-1000 ml drainage bags are most frequently preferred by healthcare professionals and patients. Additionally, this segment will continue to gain market revenue in the projected period due to its high-volume holding quality.

The global urinary drainage bags market has been divided into four regions:

North America holds the majority of market revenue share. The factors owing to this growth are presence of major market players, high rate of hospitalization, increased trend of home and hospice care for chronically ill and geriatric populations, advanced medical facilities, and high healthcare expenditure. The European region is characterized by huge number of geriatric populations suffering from incontinence, favorable reimbursements, high awareness to name a few. Furthermore, The National Health Service and the European Union of Medical Associations both assist in maintaining the financial load on patients. Asia Pacific is expected to witness prominent growth during the projection period because of an increase in the prevalence of urinary tract infections, urinary tract cancers, and hospitalizations for chronic disease treatments. The region is also supported by greater awareness for incontinence care in the general population.

1065846491,20221003,"Moscow, Oct 3 (EFE).- Russian energy giant Gazprom said Monday that the gas leaks detected in the Baltic waters from three ruptured Nord Stream pipeline strands last week had stopped.

Gazprom said the pressure in the three pipelines had been stabilized and that it was working to reduce the potential ecological risks of the leaks.

The energy company added that gas flow to Europe could resume via the Nord Streams 2 B pipeline.

“In case a decision is made to start supply through Nord Stream 2 B pipeline, (…) natural gas will be pumped back into the pipeline,” Gazprom said on Telegram in its first statement since the incident.

Three mysterious leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines linking Russia with Europe via the Baltic Sea were detected last week in Denmark and Sweden’s exclusive economic zones.

Both governments, the European Union and Nato have blamed the leaks on sabotage.

The Kremlin has dismissed veiled suggestions that Russia was behind the damage as “foolish and absurd.”

The Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline has been inoperative for a month. Operations first stopped for “routine maintenance work” and later over an alleged oil leak that Russia says it cannot repair due to Western sanctions imposed due to the war in Ukraine.

Although neither pipeline is operational after Berlin froze the Nord Stream 2 project — which would have doubled the flow of gas from Russia to Germany — over the war in Ukraine, the pipelines are filled with gas and a stable pressure must be maintained. EFE"
1065849591,20221003,
1065849592,20221003,"(Bloomberg) -- Gazprom PJSC told European gas customers that part of the damaged Nord Stream network could still transport fuel -- but only on the new pipeline that Germany ditched in February in protest at Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine.

The Nord Stream 2 pipeline was set to go into operation earlier this year when Germany pulled the plug on the project just before Russia’s invasion. The pipeline, which was set to double the capacity of Nord Stream, had been sanctioned by the U.S. and faced strong opposition in parts of Europe, forcing Germany to eventually give up on the project.

After the suspected sabotage of the network last week in a series of explosions, Gazprom said on Monday three of the lines were affected and one wasn’t. The gas giant has lowered pressure on the unaffected line B of Nord Stream 2 to inspect the link for damage and potential leaks, it said in a statement on its Telegram account.

Any start of Nord Stream 2 would require approval from the EU and is unlikely as tensions between the Kremlin and the West are deepening.

The European Union is preparing a stronger package of sanctions to punish Russia for escalating its war in Ukraine and illegally annexing four occupied territories there. The restrictions would include a price cap on Russian oil and target a range of individuals and entities, including senior Russian ministry officials and people involved in staging the recent, widely condemned referendums.

Gas has stopped leaking from the three ruptured pipelines in the Baltic Sea in the Danish and Swedish exclusive economic zones, according to Gazprom.

Traders and policy makers have been closely monitoring Gazprom’s exports to Europe for months as the continent battles its worst energy crisis in decades. The Russian company has been gradually reducing deliveries to the continent amid the war, citing western sanctions and restrictions imposed by the Kremlin as the key reasons.

The cause of the damage to the Nord Stream pipelines so far remains unknown, with western countries and Russia blaming each other.

Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said last week the pipelines had been attacked by ‘Anglo-Saxons,’ while several leaders in the European Union said they consider the attacks a sabotage. Europe has also bolstered security at key energy assets, fearing further attacks.

Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 each have a shipment capacity of 55 billion cubic meters per year, which means line B could deliver as much as 27.5 billion cubic meters per year to Germany across the Baltic Sea."
1065849593,20221003,"The restriction specifically targets Russians travelling ‘for tourism purposes’ across Finland’s eastern border with Russia, according to a statement released by the Ministry – closing off a long-standing loophole in its entry restrictions for Russian citizens.

As part of the European Union (EU), Finland has had a blanket ban on all Russian aircraft from entering its airspace since February, imposed in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The principle decision aims to stop tourism and related transit completely. The reception of visa applications is severely restricted,” the Ministry stated. The move is also intended to prevent Finland from being used as a transit country to reach other destinations within the EU.

The ban does not apply to Russian citizens who need to enter Finland for humanitarian or family reasons, or who are there to perform international obligations.

Finland has been one of several countries urging the EU to impose further restrictions on Russian tourists travelling across the bloc’s eastern borders."
1065851034,20221003,"While signing the accord to annex four Ukrainian regions namely Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, the Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that people living in these regions “have become our citizens, forever”. He further asserted that “we will defend our land with all the forces and resources we have”. To a large extent, it seems this is Russia ’s response to its recent military setback at Kharkiv.The European Union has rejected what it calls ‘illegal’ referenda and annexation and said that it will “continue to provide strong economic, military, social and financial support to Ukraine”. Similarly, while condemning Russia’s attempts, the United States has announced that it “will continue to support Ukraine ’s efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically”.These new developments complicate an already difficult situation. It also indicates further escalation in the conflict. Already the nuclear issue has entered into the rhetoric. With the damage to Nord Stream pipelines, the conflict has also entered a new phase of hybrid war threatening European energy infrastructure.As the war enters into a new phase, India will again have to weigh its options. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi sharpened New Delhi’s response emphasizing that this is ‘not an era of war’, India’s fundamental position on Russia’s role and conflict has not changed much. This was clearly evident through another abstention at the recent UNSC vote on Ukraine. At the open UN briefing on Nord stream pipeline sabotage, India also called for an “independent and objective investigation” of the incident.At the UNSC vote, India was “deeply disturbed by the turn events in Ukraine” not clearly mentioning referendum and annexation. This could also mean that India is also disturbed by huge western military support to Ukraine, which has reduced chances of a political settlement.Indian dependence on Russian military hardware has always been mentioned as one of the factors responsible for New Delhi’s reluctance to condemn Moscow for its actions in Ukraine. In the meanwhile, energy trade has also become stronger.Thanks to discounted oil purchases in the last few months. India-Russia bilateral trade between April and July 2022 was about $14 billion. This is more than India’s trade with countries such as Singapore, Australia, Germany, Japan or Netherlands during this period. As a result, Russia has emerged as the seventh largest trading partner of India during this period.Last year, Russia was India’s twenty-fifth trading partner. Now to boost Indian exports to Russia, the State Bank of India has also agreed to facilitate Rupee trade transactions to Russia. Although this is a dynamic situation with increasing sanctions against Moscow, Russia may emerge as India’s top ten trading partners in the current financial year.Strategic and defense ties with Russia were always strong. It was the commercial pillar which both countries were not able to revitalize. Despite sanctions, Russia will continue to be a major energy producer and exporter. Now the European Union and most of its Member States have clearly decided to diversify their energy imports away from Russia. Moscow clearly needs new energy markets for its exports, mainly in Asia. Apart from China, India could emerge as another major buyer of Russian energy in the coming years. Because of trusted strategic partnership, there is a clear potential of working out bilateral payment mechanisms and required infrastructure linkages in the coming years. With stronger partnership with India, Russia can also balance its dependence on China.This is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Major western powers and NATO are clearly involved in a major way. Ukraine has no chance of getting membership of the European Union and NATO in the coming years. Still the West will continue to support Kiev militarily and financially so long as it is able to fight. So basically, this is a war between major economic and military players. Both sides also have seats in the UNSC. The conflict has also revitalized NATO as well as the Trans-Atlantic alliance. Now the West is looking for a ‘strategic defeat’ of Russia and a possible regime change in Moscow. In these circumstances, ‘victory’ or compromise for any one side is not going to be easy.India has close strategic ties with both sides and good relations with Ukraine. Still, due to the current nature of the conflict, room for playing a mediatory role for New Delhi is limited. So far, India has managed well in taking a ‘neutral stance’ and protecting its interests. As the conflict is entering another phase, the room for maneuvering is going to be much more limited due to a hardened western stance."
1065852389,20221003,"Representatives from the European Union and Israel held high-level talks on Monday for the first time in a decade.

The EU said it would press Israel on stalled peace efforts and the situation in the Palestinian territories during the talks in Brussels.

This is the first time the bloc has held an ""Association Council"" meeting with Israel since 2012.

What will the EU, Israel talks address?

""We will discuss frankly and openly about some specific issues which are of our mutual concern,"" EU top diplomat Josep Borrell said at the start of the meeting.

""I am talking about the situation in the Palestinian territories and the Middle East peace process, which is stalled.""

Borrell expressed support for a speech by Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid to the UN General Assembly, in which the Israeli leader called for an ""agreement with the Palestinians based on two states for two peoples.""

""This is also what we want to push for,"" Borrell said. ""We want the resumption of a political process that can lead to a two-state solution and a comprehensive regional peace. We have to explore how we can put this into practice.""

In a speech he delivered to the UN General Assembly after Lapid, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said ""our confidence in achieving a peace based on justice and international law is waning, due to the Israeli occupation policies.""

Borrell said that a UN report on the situation in the Palestinian territories was ""worrisome."" According to the report, the number of Palestinians killed this year reached its highest level since 2007.

Israel and the EU also differ on attempts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Last month, Lapid said returning to the nuclear agreement would be a ""mistake"" at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

""This is one of the issues in which certainly we disagree,"" Borrell said. ""For the time being in any case, those (nuclear deal) negotiations are stalled."""

• After the balance sheet date, raised CHF 1.25 million in financing with sophisticated investors.

ZURICH, Switzerland, Oct. 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LR â Achiko AG (SIX: ACHI; OTCQB: ACHKF; ISIN CH0522213468) (âAchikoâ, the âCompanyâ) is pleased to announce its financial results for the period of six months to June 30, 2022, and its progress since then which can be found at https://www.achiko.com/financials.

In the first half of 2022, Achiko AG has confirmed that calibration testing of its affordable non-invasive Covid-19 saliva-based rapid test technology,Â AptameXâ¢, indicated the systemâs ability to deliver a >97% sensitive and >97% specific rapid test at a wider range of viral loads than most other rapid tests.

âThe ability to offer healthcare professionals a practical alternative to PCR tests and less accurate antigen based rapid tests has been a major driver for Achikoâs research and clinical development teams to produce the worldâs first scale application using DNA aptamers in a commercial diagnostic setting,â said Mr. Steven Goh, CEO of Achiko. âThe use of differentiated chemistry to develop a range of non-invasive, highly accurate, and cost-effective rapid tests with Achikoâs AptameXâ¢ technology, positions the Company at the leading edge of diagnostic development moving forward.â

Despite another challenging period for the Company, it has made significant progress with its initial commercial application of its AptameXâ¢ technology and expects to be generating significant revenue from AptameXâ¢ in Indonesia in the final quarter of 2022.

Commercialization in Indonesia and BeyondA key focus of operations during the reporting period was to progress the Companyâs efforts to successfully launch a scalable test product in Indonesia. As part of this, the Company completed its pre-sales validation process in Indonesia with first generation test kits and identified a range of improvements that are being incorporated into its second-generation product. Key materials are now being produced in Taiwan and scale plastics and assembly being undertaken in Indonesia.

In April, the Company signed a major marketing and sales agreement with Pengurus Wilayah Nahdlatul Ulama DKI Jakarta (PWNU), the Jakarta District of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the largest Islamic organization in the world, located primarily in Indonesia. The agreement provides for the supply and delivery of aptamer-based diagnostics, first to its Jakarta branch of over 4 million members, and on success, to the larger membership of over 90 million registered members. At the same time, the Company signed an updated agreement with PT Indofarma TbK (Indofarma) to use its sister digital passporting serviceÂ Teman SehatTMÂ (âHealth Buddyâ) as a telehealth platform for its diagnostic services. Indofarma is one of Indonesiaâs oldest pharmaceutical companies (part owned by the Government). It supplies over 13,000 pharmacies, 4,000 hospitals, and 9,000 health facilities. It also conducts testing in over one hundred airports and is a national manufacturer of medical devices and the National Contract Research Organization.

In May, the Company successfully registered AptameXâ¢ under the European Union Medical Device Research and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation and obtained a CE Mark that grants it access to 27 countries in the European Union for its Covid-19 AptameXâ¢ test and system.

Financial ResultsAchiko concluded the first half of 2022 with an operating loss of USD $2.4 million in comparison to a loss of USD $4.6 million in the first half of 2021. The Company reduced its expense base in Switzerland and focused its development efforts through one primary research and development team.

The ability to manage costs with a reduced footprint has been important during a challenging period for the Company. Delays with completing the full year accounts and subsequent audit took up a considerable amount of management time and attention and contributed to the Companyâs delay to raise sufficient finance in time to launch and scale production in Indonesia as planned before the end of the period. Post balance date, the Company has completed CHF 1.25 million in financing by a number of sophisticated investors. Funds are being applied to launching and scaling commercialization efforts in Indonesia and beyond and bringing the Company towards good standing.

Steven Goh commented: âWe are grateful to our shareholders and our partners for their help and support and look forward to a brighter finish to 2022 and beyond.â

AptameXâ¢: Product Development, Sales, and Market OutlookâAchikoâs core objective is to bring access to better, more affordable, and accurate diagnostics,â Goh added. âWith its AptameXâ¢ technology, the Company is well placed to take advantage of major healthcare trends including delivering increasingly accurate diagnosis at Point of Care by non-invasive means and using technology to deliver rapid results in real time.â AptameXâ¢ offers public health assurance through early detection by regularly using a telehealth platform for diagnostics equipped with the latest technological diagnostic tests that are comfortable, accurate and affordable.

Despite delays in production to meet forecast demand, the outlook for AptameXâ¢ in Indonesia remains encouraging and the Company expects to be producing and delivering over one million tests per month in the final quarter of this calendar year. Samples are also being produced for use in other Asian countries, Europe, and the Middle East.

Corporate Initiatives During the Reporting Period, the Company welcomed Mr. Derek Brandt as a Member of its Advisory Board and after balance date farewelled Ms. Carol Aebi. The Company is moving to strengthen its corporate leadership in Finance and other important functions with a series of key executive appointments. Further details shall be released in advance of and as part of the upcoming AGM that will now be held in late October / early November at a date to be announced.

ABOUT ACHIKO AGÂ Â Achiko AG (SIX: ACHI.SW; OTCQB: ACHKF; www.achiko.com) is developing disruptive diagnostic solutions that put people first. The Companyâs lead product, AptameXâ¢, is a rapid, reliable Covid-19 test with a companion app, Teman Sehatâ¢, offering a user-friendly digital health passport.Â Â AptameXâ¢ and Teman Sehatâ¢ were launched in Indonesia in mid-2021 and AptameXâ¢ received the CE Mark in the European Union in May 2022.

1065861084,20221003,"The outlook for Israel in the new year is unusually clear, but very complex.

Domestically social divisions and political dysfunctionality will continue. The November election is unlikely to resolve anything. Even if one side or the other manages to patch up a coalition government, it will be subject to the whims of two or three Knesset members in order to stay in office. The alternative, of course, is yet another election. In the meantime Israel will continue as it has been for some time now--a scientific, technological, cultural and military success, despite the political gridlock and the fact that a significant percentage of the population is voluntarily sidelined. The recent Gaza crisis was very indicative in that regard--an intelligence and military triumph, despite the absence of a functioning political system. However, the prominence of intelligence and especially military leadership, brings with it its own dangers to democracy.

As to the Palestinian conundrum, Israel simply cannot continue much longer kicking the can down the road. Abbas will be gone sooner rather than later, and all indications are that when that happens, Hamas and Islamic Jihad will take over, unless prevented from doing so by Israeli military action, which would mean a prolonged and bloody war, with a final result entirely unpredictable. An alternative exists in the person of Mohammed Dahlan, exiled in the UAE, who could well take over in the West Bank under Israeli and UAE sponsorship. But something of the sort has to be prepared in advance and ready to be triggered at a moment's notice.

Regionally, the picture is much more optimistic. The Abraham Accords are a huge economic, financial, commercial and cultural success. Saudi Arabia is likely to join before long and in the meantime has excellent unofficial relations with Israel. Relations with Egypt, which for years could only be described as chilly, have warmed up significantly.

The same is true with Turkey, although given Erdogan's highly unpredictable behavior, may not last. And then, of course, there is Iran and its terrorist proxies. However, the new year may well bring good news on that front also. The fact that a majority of the people of Iran detest the theocratic dictatorship to which they are subject is manifest.

The recent defection of an important group of Shi'a scholars is very significant. All depends on the continued loyalty to the regime of the armed forces, the basij militia and above all the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. If the regime falls, hopefully a moderate government, perhaps under the Pahlavi pretender, will take over and Iran will become a cooperative player in the region rather than its scourge. The Iranian proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza and the West Bank will be bereft of external support and will soon lose their geopolitical significance, although the terrorist groups will not disappear, any more than al-Qaida and ISIS have disappeared.

Internationally, the scene is quite positive. Relations with the US and China are good and improving with the European Union. Russia is a problem due to ""Putin's War"" in Ukraine and the desire of the Israeli government to not damage its deal whereby the Russians do not interfere with Israeli air attacks on Iranian facilities and assets in Syria, where Russia has a naval, air and ground presence. But Israel has successfully squared that circle so far and there is no good reason to think it will not be able to continue to do so.

In sum, the most significant dangers to Israel in the coming year, are very likely to be, and to remain, domestic rather than regional or international. Indeed, the regional picture is good and likely to improve, the international scene is stable, but the domestic situation is highly problematical and may very well take a turn for the worse.

1065862990,20221003,"Brussels: The EU vowed to press Israel Monday on the treatment of Palestinians, settlement expansions and stalled peace efforts at the first meeting in a decade of a frozen joint council.

“We will discuss frankly and openly about some specific issues which are of our mutual concern,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said at the start of the meeting in Brussels.

“I am talking about the situation in the Palestinian territories and the Middle East peace process which is stalled.”

Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid dialled in remotely for the EU-Israel Association Council talks and the country’s travelling delegation was headed by intelligence minister Elazar Stern.

Meetings of the council have been suspended for a decade since Israel ditched them over the EU’s opposition to expanding colonies in the West Bank.

The EU has been looking for a fresh start with Israel since right-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu was ousted from office in 2021 after 12 years in charge.

“All in all, today is a good occasion to show our determination to have a positive and fruitful relationship with Israel, pushing for peace,” Borrell said.

Borrell said support expressed by Lapid in a speech at the UN for a two-state solution with the Palestinians was “very important”.

“We want the resumption of a political process that can lead to a two-state solution and a comprehensive regional peace,” Borrell said.

But he said a UN report on the situation in the occupied territories was “worrisome” as the number of Palestinians reported killed this year reached the highest level since 2007.

Another bone of contention between the two sides is Israel’s firm opposition to EU-mediated efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

“Well, this is one of the issues in which certainly we disagree,” Borrell said.

“For the time being in any case, those (nuclear deal) negotiations are stalled.”"
1065865894,20221003,"A heavy oil refinery turnaround season in Europe this autumn, plus French strike action, is set to push diesel prices higher and tighten supplies ahead of a European Union ban on Russian refined products which is due to come into force early next year.

In October, around 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude refining capacity is expected to be offline in Europe for planned and unplanned maintenance, Energy Aspect estimated.

This figure compares with 1.1 million bpd of offline capacity in September, and is above the 2015-2019 average for this period. In November, offline capacity is expected to reach 600,000 bpd.

The busier maintenance schedule is likely to be related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Given all the Covid-related restrictions, social distancing etc, it’s likely that not a lot of extensive works were actually carried out but rather just essential maintenance,” Energy Aspect’s Livia Gallarti said.

Maintenance outages next month include Eni’s ENI.M Sannazzaro refinery in Italy, Repsol’s Tarragona refinery in Spain, and Galp Energia’s Sines refinery, among others.

“The European diesel market is looking a bit softer than we had expected say this time last month,” Gallarti said, adding that the consultancy has softened its European demand forecast as economic pressures mount.

Europe has also been upping its diesel imports from other regions like the Middle East and Asia, with September arrivals hitting a three-year high of 1.6 million barrels per day, based on data from oil analytics firm Vortexa.

But while higher imports and a softening demand outlook are helping to ease the pressure on diesel markets, widespread refinery outages in France, partly due to strike action, could tighten supplies again.

One European trader said that while the market has priced in, and to a large extent prepared for the planned outages, it is the unplanned outages that could cause problems for the oil products market.

“The issue is unexpected outages like the French strikes,” he said.

 Walkouts over pay and unplanned maintenance have resulted the temporary shutdown of four out France’s six oil refineries in the week to 28 September.

This has taken offline 740,000 bpd, or over 60% of France’s refining capacity.

Exxon Mobil, which operates two of the shut plants, told Reuters it had temporarily put limitations in place for customers, saying this was in accordance with the terms of its supply contracts.

Benchmark European diesel profit margins hit a two-week high of about $50 a barrel on Wednesday, based on Reuters assessments, driven by the French strikes.

Analysts expect the shutdowns to tighten refined product supply if they drag on.

“The wave of strikes in France took the market by surprise and there is uncertainty about its duration,” OilX analyst Neil Crosby said.

“Overall, we remain constructive diesel cracks come Q12023 as the market will struggle to replace lost Russian supplies,” Gallarti said, adding that Europe stands to lose 500,000-600,000 bpd of Russian diesel due to sanctions.

The European Union will stop buying all Russian crude oil delivered by sea from early December, and will ban all Russian refined products two months later, in protest over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“We struggle to see [diesel] stocks building massively from where we are,” Woodmac analyst Mark Williams said.

“We expect prices to really spike … mid-January, probably February, but we may see a spike little bit earlier as the market starts to panic,” he added.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell welcomed the recent support from Lapid — who took part in Monday's talks by videoconference — for an end to the conflict based on an Israeli and Palestinian state living peacefully side by side.

""This is also what we want to push for. We want the resumption of a political process that can lead to a two-state solution and a comprehensive regional peace,"" Borrell said. ""We have to explore how we can put this into practice.""

""It's better to sit and discuss frankly, than to avoid any contact. Certainly we disagree. Certainly we express concern, but I think it's more positive to sit and discuss,"" Borrell told reporters in Brussels. It's the first time the two sides have held an ""Association Council"" since July 2012.

However, there is no short-term prospect for peace.

Israel's military occupation of the West Bank is now in its 55th year. The last real peace talks ended in 2009, and critics say growing Israeli settlements in the West Bank and elsewhere undermine any hopes for a two-state solution. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank along with Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, controlled by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, for a future state.

At the U.N. General Assembly last month, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that ""our confidence in achieving a peace based on justice and international law is waning, due to the Israeli occupation policies.""

Speaking a day after Lapid, Abbas delivered a pessimistic assessment of diplomacy, saying a ""frantic campaign to confiscate our lands"" persisted in the generations-long dispute, while the military ""are killing the Palestinian people in broad daylight"" with impunity."
1065871108,20221003,"Twenty-two-year-old Mahsa Amini from Iran’s Kurdistan province visited Tehran with her family on September 13. While exiting the metro with members of her family, Mahsa was arrested in Tehran by the so-called morality police for purportedly wearing an “improper” hijab and taken to the Vorzara Detention Center. Three days later she was pronounced braindead. State-affiliated media claimed Amini suffered a heart attack; her family says she was in perfect health.

 

 Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the prominent human rights NGO Center for Human Rights in Iran, said Amini “was arrested under the guise of the state’s forced-hijab law and died shortly after. The government is responsible for her death and decades of women being harassed, detained, and otherwise harmed under the guise of this discriminatory, inhuman law.”

 

 Demonstrations over Amini’s treatment by authorities broke out in numerous cities across Iran, including in Tehran and in Kurdistan province. Peaceful protesters have been met with force, and the Human Rights Activists News Agency, an organization monitoring rights violations in Iran, has identified at least 54 protesters killed during the protests.

 

 Amini’s appalling death in police custody was condemned by the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.

 

 Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on in a statement on Twitter, “Mahsa Amini should be alive today. Instead, the United States and the Iranian people mourn her. We call on the Iranian government to end its systematic persecution of women and to allow peaceful protest.”

 

 At a press briefing, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said, “[Amini’s death] is a reflection of the complete repression and brutality of a regime that a woman simply seeking to exercise her basic right could die in this way. And it is not surprising that we are seeing people in all walks of life come out in Iran to object vigorously to that and say this is not the kind of society that they want to live in.

 

 “It is not consistent with any country’s obligations under the Universal Declaration of Huan Rights,” declared National Security Advisor Sullivan. “And it’s something the United States will speak our fiercely and unequivocally against.”"

While lauding cooperation between the EU and Israel on COVID-19, energy, Mediterranean security, cyber, trade and more — much of the document criticizes Israel for its policies toward the Palestinians. Some 21 of the 54 paragraphs deal with the Palestinians, use of force, and the peace process.

The EU expresses concern over journalist Shireen Abu Akleh’s death, the loss of life in the recent round of fighting in August, conditions in Gaza, the religious status quo in Jerusalem and the settlements, among other related issues.

The statement does condemn “indiscriminate launching of rockets by Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups,” while affirming Israel’s right to self-defense and calling for the release of Israelis held in Gaza.

The EU calls Iran “central to security in the region,” while saying that its support for armed proxies is a significant source of instability. “The restoration and full re-implementation of the JCPOA has the potential to contribute positively to regional prosperity and security,” the documents continues. “It could further encourage a constructive approach in the region as well as offer a platform for further efforts to build and consolidate confidence.”

On Ukraine, the EU “welcomes Israel’s assistance to Ukraine and its citizens, including the supply of defensive military equipment and humanitarian aid.” It also lauds Israel for working to ensure that it can’t be used to circumvent sanctions.

The EU discusses at length its commitment to fighting antisemitism, and the “increasing importance of Holocaust remembrance and civic education in order to counter the development of antisemitic prejudices and stereotypes.”"
1065875412,20221003,"Mr Irchad Razaarly, the European Union Ambassador, says there is no ban on Ghana’s cocoa into the European market as speculated in the media space.

“We want more cocoa, and we are supporting Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire to produce cocoa and other commodities in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner,” he said.

The Ambassador said this on Monday at the second edition of the Orange Cocoa Day on the theme: ” Exploring How Improved Access to Land and Tree Tenure Promote Sustainability in the Cocoa Value Chain.”

The event was organised by the Embassy of the Netherlands together with the European Union Delegation to Ghana in partnership with the European Forest Institute, Solidaridad West Africa, Meridia, and others.

Mr Razaarly said the call for sustainable cocoa production was growing globally and particularly in Europe, stressing that EU citizens were increasingly demanding measures to ensure that cocoa and other commodities were produced in an environmentally sustainable way.

He said the EU had proposed a regulation, which was aimed at reducing the impact of products placed on the Union’s market for six commodities – palm oil, soya, wood, cattle, cocoa, and coffee.

The purpose of the regulation, the Ambassador said, was to minimise the EU’s contribution to global deforestation and to promote the consumption of products from deforestation-free supply chains.

Touching on EU ongoing support, Mr Razaarly said the Union had supported COCOBOD to roll-out the Cocoa Management System through a sensitisation campaign, training of extension staff to verify the data collected and the provision of equipment.

“We work with COCOBOD and the Forestry Commission on the mapping and deforestation risk assessment. Ghana has good experience in Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade, which could be replicated in the cocoa sector”

He re-iterated the EU’s commitment to the dialogue on sustainable cocoa and support to the sector and stated that Ghana’s efforts towards sustainability were aligned with the Union’s priorities.

“Providing a decent living income for cocoa farmers and ensuring the sustainability of the value chain, both in terms of labour rights and environmental protection, are key priorities for the EU,” he said.

Ms Katja Lasseur, the Deputy Dutch Ambassador to Ghana, said the theme was timely because investment in the cocoa sector thrived when the lands were secured free of any litigation.

“As part of our global strategy, the Netherlands will continue to support efforts to promote the sustainability of the cocoa sector and improve land and tree tenure arrangements that mostly affect cocoa farmers across Ghana’s cocoa growing areas,” she said.

Nana Kwaw Asante Bediatu II, the Sefwi Divisional Chief of Asempaneye, called for better remuneration of farmers to motivate other prospective farmers to venture into cocoa farming.

He called for more investment in the documentation of farmlands to ensure the sustainability of cocoa production for socio-economic development.

The participants called for a dialogue to address challenges in the sector, saying, farming and production of cocoa beans were largely poorly regulated in the country."

1065877420,20221003,"While Iranian women are being killed fighting for the right not to wear hijab, European Union is propagating saying “Freedom” lies in hijab. According to Valeurs Actulles, a controversial campaign, recently launched by the Council of Europe, via its program for inclusion and the fight against discrimination, a promotional campaign celebrating diversity and “freedom in the hijab” has been denounced by several politicians in France, leading some to request the removal of the posters. These feature portraits of several young veiled women with a message in English “Beauty is in diversity as freedom is in hijab” (“Beauty is in diversity as freedom is in the hijab”).

Passing relatively unnoticed at first, the campaign, co-financed by the European Union, ended up provoking the ire of Internet users and many political figures such as Nadine Morano, who challenged Ursula von der Leyen. “Madam President of the European Commission, I ask you to immediately put an end to this scandal of the use of European funds for scandalous Islamist propaganda. This campaign is an insult to Iranian women who are dying for their freedom,” she tweeted on Wednesday, September 28.

The acting president of the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, also reacted on social networks, denouncing the attitude of the European Union, which “takes a new step in submission by promoting the Islamic veil worn by a little girl”. “Let us all be well aware that this relativism and this cowardice are preparing the ground for a victory of obscurantism on our continent”, he added. This campaign shows in particular that religious freedom should not be confused with the promotion of a religious sign.

Majority of the Europeans have expressed dismay at this campaign of the European Union. There also is uproar in the social media. Here are some comments:

Frede said: Nothing to say just to look at the legitimate fight of the Iranian women…. This Europe is up to the citizens to dismiss it.

Annie said: One more act which proves if necessary, that a FREXIT is urgent to preserve the existence of FRANCE!

Laura said: Only solution to fight against our disappearance FREXIT.

Helen said: It would be appropriate to show all the women who’ve been murdered, maimed, had acid thrown in their faces and disfigured for now being ‘properly’ hijabed. Indeed, there should be posters of all that put up along with those murdered in Iran of late. Also, the history of those who died because they were not properly covered. Diversity.

Regine said: Ah, yes: freedom not to be beaten to death for not wearing it; freedom to not be arrested and beaten to death for not wearing it appropriately; freedom to walk out in the street and not be arrested for not wearing it; so much freedom in the rag of slavery to the ideas brought forward from the supposed mouth of a mass-murdering rapist of children, slave-trading thief and lying son of Satan the devil.

Oppressed females have freedom to not wear it or wear it in some nations – the US, UK, Canada, and a few others…if their husbands, brothers, fathers, uncles, grandfathers, fathers-in-law, allow the woman to make a choice for herself.

The question is “Why are all of these people who aren’t being forced to wear the ugly rag telling everyone else how much *Freedom” is in it?

Jennifer said: The so far corrupt, treacherous, bribed (from Turkish money that are either funneled through Qatar or income from the state run smuggling or international prostitution networks of Turkey), politicians that represent the union so far, and many thanks to Germany for that condition, they have led Europe to multiple suicide.

The European Union has committed suicide by importing the neo-Marxist American open borders policy and receiving millions of young Muslims who are here to conquer and enslave, in other words Islamize.

The EU also committed economic suicide, many thanks to Germany, by accepting and imposing the same policies with the neo-Marxists in USA in energy production and by turning to the green energy, while countries like china continue to produce the most of the greenhouse gasses and continue therefore to economically develop on our expense.

It also committed energy suicide by imposing sanction on Russia to which it is energy depended by 40% at least with natural gas.

The neo-Marxists of the USA have managed to drag and drug Europe into many types of suicide and considering the outcry against the happy tramp parenthesis in the USA did not move an inch away from those steps it has taken ever.

It is a fascist oppressive and authoritarian ruling of the constitutions of so many countries that it is dragging to destruction with its policies and has been fascist and extremely strict with any country that does not accept its suicidal policies within members of the union.

This achieved by bribes on the main political figures of the union and the rest of the head of state.

Just like some write on this website which expresses me, the neo-Marxists worldwide in an alliance with the Islamic invasion have achieved the suicide of Europe.

Sabrina said: Yeah, right. “Freedom is in Hijab”. What a load of absolute bullshit. This is propaganda for barbaric, misogynistic Islam. And this crap comes at the same time as the women are demonstrating against having to wear the primitive, hideous hijab in Iran, because they want the Freedom to not wear the stinking hijab. Oppression is in the hijab. Freedom is in being able to choose freely whether you want to wear the shitty garment or not wear it. Islam is always the opposite of freedom in all areas of life. Islam is always about bullying and intimidating people into toeing the barbaric line. I will say that I do believe that here in Australia there are plenty of Muslim women who do choose to wear the head garment and it is because they want to make a statement to all non-Muslims that they are Muslims and they don’t want to actually fit in with the non-Muslims in our society. The usual them or us mentality of Muslims who don’t want to assimilate with non-Muslims. Total incompatibility as usual.

Monica said: there are many in the US who wear it also. There are probably some who would rather not, but due to being married or under another male’s thumb, they go with the safety rather than the boldness. Some who have thrown it off, have paid with their lives.

Then, there are some, like Ilhan and Sarsour, and many I have personally seen whom one can tell are making the stupid attempt to ‘lord it over” those of us who don’t feel the need or desire to bend the back and knee and bow the head to Satan.

I have to wonder just how much they perspire under those awful rags – how much shampoo is needed to wash away the foul odors.

Sofia said: Yes, it is hard to know, some history, whether the women and teenage Muslim girls are scared not to wear the head covering or not. I can’t tell of course, but from the Muslims I see, I do often think that many of these Muslim women and teenagers are proclaiming to us infidels that they aren’t going to assimilate with dirty infidels like us. There are Muslims who don’t wear the head gear as well, so I guess that they must be either married to, or are daughters of, fairly mellow types of Muslim men. It is annoying to read this nonsense in this report saying that “Hijab is freedom” at the same time as those courageous demonstrators in Iran are showing clearly that being forced to wear the head gear is oppression. But Islam is all about tyranny and intimidation in all aspects of life. It is a disgusting religion. I mean that death for apostasy rule says it all.

Sonia said: European Union, Council of Europe fund ad campaign: ‘Freedom Is In Hijab’.

Meanwhile, Iranian women are being killed fighting for the right not to wear hijab. Could the EU be more tone-deaf? Could it be more unmistakably on the path to submission and Islamization?

And girls have been “Honor Killed” by their families for refusing to wear Hijab. How indicative of “freedom” is that? And European taxpayers are funding this vicious stupidity.

Eleanor said: One could almost be forgiven for thinking they (the EU) are preparing for the great take-over.

Elizabeth said: More like “willfully” tone-deaf, blind and in submission.

It wouldn’t surprise me if this nonsensical poster and cliché is originating from some Swedish left-wing feminists in the EU. It fits the pattern of their word games in order to deceive people."
1065877429,20221003,"The European Union, through its diplomatic service, expressed disappointment over the inability to further respect the ceasefire in Yemen.

The truce agreed between the Houthis and the Yemeni government was to be extended for an additional six months, at the suggestion of the United Nations and its representative Hans Grundberg. But both sides failed to reach an agreement and blame each other.

According to the European Union, the ""maximalist positions"" did not ""make the task"" of the UN representative easier.

- This truce has delivered many tangible benefits to millions of Yemenis and the UN Special Representative H. Grundberg's proposal offers the opportunity to significantly increase its impact, including the payment of salaries to officials, additional flights to and from Sana'a, uninterrupted oil deliveries through the port of Hudaya and the reopening of the road around Taez, stands in the reaction of the European Union, which reiterates that this would have positive consequences for the lives of millions of Yemeni citizens.

The Union called on the Houthis to ""show a real commitment to peace"" and come forward with moderate demands, as well as to engage in dialogue with the representative of the United Nations.

- Rejecting this proposal is a strategic mistake, this is not what the Yemenis want and deserve, the UN said.

Yemen's war between the government and the Houthi rebel group began in 2014 when the Houthis, backed by Iran, seized the capital Sanaa and much of northern Yemen. The Yemeni government, for its part, has the support of Saudi Arabia, which supplies it with military equipment."

1065886593,20221003,"New black and white funeral banners have appeared at the entrances to Armenian villages near the border with Azerbaijan. In Lichk, in the Martouni region, one was erected to honor the memory of 20-year-old Arthur Markarian. The young man was one of the 204 Armenian soldiers killed in the attacks conducted by Baku on Armenian territory on September 13 and 14.

Arthur had been fulfilling his military service for a year when a deluge of artillery, rocket launchers and drones hit his outpost near the border with Azerbaijan, but not in Nagorno Karabakh, the separatist enclave at the heart of the last war between the two countries in the fall of 2020. For two days, more than 30 Armenian towns and villages, including Djermouk, Goris, Kapan, Sotk and Vardenis, were attacked. It's an assault on a scale unheard of since the end of the war. Three civilians were also killed, 7,600 people were displaced, and 20 soldiers were captured. Yerevan denounced Baku's ""aggression"", who claimed to have retaliated to ""provocations"" and counted more than 70 dead among its ranks. The heads of diplomacy from both countries met in Geneva on Sunday, October 2, to discuss peace talks, without any progress.

Since the attacks, Arthur's family and neighbors have been gathering daily around the altar in the living room in memory of the young soldier whose portrait hangs above a large Armenian flag near the dinner table. His father, Gevidan Markarian, is infuriated by the government and the army. ""There is no authority or army here,"" he said. ""We are all alone, surrounded by our enemies."" Sitting on a bench, the women nodded in silence.

Their sense of abandonment has grown since Russia, Armenia's traditional ally, refused to provide the country with military aid within the framework of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), an alliance dominated by Moscow. Russia has been preoccupied with the war in Ukraine, where it is experiencing a series of military setbacks. It has sent a simple observation mission and this lack of interest feeds growing anti-Russian sentiment. The population is already resentful of Moscow's inaction during the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, even though, technically, the military alliance that links the two countries does not concern the separatist enclave. ""Russia is supposed to be our ally and protect us, but in reality, we see nothing! Now, we don't expect anything from them,"" said the uncle of the deceased, Markar Markarian.

The theme tune of The Godfather echoed regularly around the table. Each time, the uncle pulled out his phone, turned off the ringer, and resumed the conversation. The family successively mentioned the weakness of the army, worn out since the end of the war in 2020, the exceptional agreement reached in July between the European Union and Baku on gas deliveries, to their great dismay, and the temptation to leave the village in the face of the advance of the Azerbaijanis.

1065890098,20221003,"The European Union and Israel have held high-level talks for the first time in 10 years in which the Europeans tried to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid on a two-state solution to the conflict with the Palestinians, AP reports.

EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell welcomed Lapid's recent support for ending the conflict based on a peaceful coexistence between Israeli and Palestinian states.

“This is also what we want to push for. We want the resumption of a political process that can lead to a two-state solution and a comprehensive regional peace,” Borrell said. “We have to explore how we can put this into practice.”

“It’s better to sit and discuss frankly, than to avoid any contact. Certainly we disagree. Certainly we express concern, but I think it’s more positive to sit and discuss,” Borrell told reporters in Brussels. It’s the first time the two sides have held an “Association Council” since July 2012.

However, there is no short-term prospect for peace.

Israel's military occupation of the West Bank has been going on for 55 years. The last real peace talks ended in 2009, and critics say growing Israeli settlements in the West Bank and elsewhere are undermining any hope of a two-state solution."
1065894653,20221003,"This year’s UN climate conference (COP27) will take place against a backdrop of global crises.

The ripple effects of COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have sent food and energy prices soaring to record highs, while unprecedented climate disasters are fueling widespread and devastating disruptions with historic levels of rain, heat, drought, fires and storms impacting almost every corner of the world.

A climate catastrophe in Pakistan claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people and displaced tens of millions. Floods and storms in southern Africa during the first half of 2022 killed hundreds of people and severely disrupted economic activity. Millions in the Horn of Africa are starving due to an epic drought. A severe drought battered China’s food and energy production, causing rolling blackouts and water and power rationing. And Europe is facing its worst drought in 500 years, along with scorching heatwaves.

These compounding crises underscore the urgent need for countries to work together at COP27 to accelerate climate action and rebuild confidence that global, collective action can solve humanity’s greatest challenges.

COP27 takes place in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt from November 6-18, 2022. It’s essential that decision-makers make progress across six key tasks to advance future international climate action and support:

At the closing of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, one of the headline questions centered on how countries would address the need for finance to address loss and damage, those impacts from climate change that are so severe communities are simply unable to adapt to them. Developing countries argued for establishing a loss and damage finance “facility,” which could mean a dedicated arrangement through which finance could be channeled.

Yet due to pushback by developed nations such as the United States and European Union, countries instead agreed to establish the Glasgow Dialogue on Loss and Damage, dedicated to discussing possible funding arrangements and set to run through 2024. The first session of the dialogue kicked off at the UN climate negotiations in Bonn in June 2022, where several developing countries made their view clear that talks must lead to a finance facility and that such a facility cannot wait until 2024. Many developed countries, meanwhile, argued that there are already mechanisms to channel funding to avert, minimize, and address loss and damage, such as through Green Climate Fund (GCF) (although it does not have loss and damage in its current mandate), the Global Shield, InsuResilience and the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. Their argument is that the global community should strengthen these channels rather than establish a new institution.

Developing countries and civil society experts counter that existing finance is grossly inadequate, and that loss and damage finance needs are distinct and additional to finance for adaptation, humanitarian assistance or development assistance.

At a bare minimum, COP 27 should kickstart a process to formalize funding arrangements to respond to loss and damage under the UNFCCC. At the same time, initiatives beyond the formal UN negotiations must also play a role to meet scale of what is needed.

Countries were not originally scheduled to formally discuss funding arrangements for loss and damage at COP27, but the Group of 77 and China (which essentially includes all developing nations) has requested it be added to the agenda. This will require consensus across all countries, both developed and developing, on the first day of the talks. If countries fail to agree to this agenda item, proceedings at the climate summit could derail right from the start.

In some good news, building on commitments made by Scotland and Wallonia (Belgium) and a group of philanthropies during COP26, Denmark announced in September 2022 a pledge of 100 million Danish Krone (approximately $13 million) for loss and damage. The Climate Vulnerable Forum and the Vulnerable Twenty (V20) Group will also launch a crowd-sourcing loss and damage funding campaign in early October 2022. These are positive developments that underscore the need to elevate loss and damage at COP27.

In addition to possible discussions about creating funding arrangements to address loss and damage, at COP27, negotiators are on the hook to operationalize the Santiago Network on Loss and Damage. This network was created in 2019 to provide countries with knowledge and technical assistance to address loss and damage. Whether negotiators fully operationalize the Santiago Network is another measure of success for COP27.

As an increasing number of countries finalize their national adaptation plan documents (NAPs) and make more detailed, ambitious commitments in the adaptation components of their NDCs, the global focus is shifting from planning to implementation — and not a moment too soon. The recent IPCC report noted that intensifying climate change impacts require that adaptation action be sped up and scaled up to adequately address the needs of vulnerable countries and communities.

Finance must scale significantly to support adaptation needs. At COP26, developed countries agreed to at least double finance for adaptation from 2019 levels by 2025, which equates to roughly $40 billion. Many stakeholders are calling for much greater levels of adaptation funding, and for adaptation finance to match that dedicated to curbing emissions (the latest available figures show that adaptation finance only amounts to approximately a third of total climate finance). A recent report from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) shows an increase in adaptation finance from 2019 to 2020 (the most recent year for which data is available) from $20.3 billion to $28.6 billion, but such increases will have to continue if the $40 billion target is to be met and exceeded.

At COP27, developed countries must also specify how they will ensure this finance reaches those who need it most. This will mean committing more finance for locally led adaptation, ensuring local people and organizations who are often disproportionately vulnerable to climate impacts have a say in investment decisions and can access the funding and other resources they need to build resilience.

Countries will also be pressed to make progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) in Egypt. Established under Article 7.1 of the Paris Agreement in 2015, this goal aims to provide a framework to define the process, action and support needed to enhance adaptative capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability, while contributing to sustainable development. To help define the goal and how it should be measured and assessed, countries established the Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work program (GlaSS) on the Global Goal on Adaptation at COP26, to run from 2022 through 2023. COP27 will host another of the year’s four workshops under the work program. During the upcoming GlaSS workshops, countries must focus on making tangible, substantive progress; leaders must ensure that setting an ambitious goal with robust tracking mechanisms is a high priority politically.

The GlaSS discussions also provide an opportunity to help advance equitable, locally led adaptation. The GGA could include metrics for tracking progress on locally led adaptation, including to account for quantity and quality of finance reaching local communities. The GlaSS program could also establish common definitions of “local” and “locally led,” formally recognize the Principles for Locally Led Adaptation, and ensure local communities and organizations can participate in discussions around the global goal.

Strengthening monitoring and evaluating of adaptation is also vital as more countries turn to implementing their recently completed NAP documents and more ambitious NDCs. Many countries are grappling with how to establish national metrics and monitoring systems. At COP27, progress on the GGA should include consideration of how to link the global adaptation goal to countries’ own efforts to monitor implementation of their NAPs and NDCs.

As part of the Glasgow Climate Pact at COP26, countries were requested to “revisit and strengthen” their 2030 emissions-reduction targets — known as “nationally determined contributions,” or NDCs — by the end of 2022 to better align with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F). So far, only 23 countries have come forward with new or updated NDCs since COP26.

Major emitters that have submitted more ambitious climate plans include India, Australia, Indonesia and Egypt. Several others, including Mexico, Turkey, Vietnam and Chile, are expected to release updated or enhanced NDCs later this year, though they already missed a deadline for inclusion in the UN synthesis report to be published ahead of COP27. By COP27, all countries, especially major emitters, should strengthen their 2030 emissions targets. These targets also need to be backed by policies — and crucially, investment — to turn them into action.

And while there is no room for backsliding on climate commitments, in 2022, some major emitting countries seem to be doing just that in response to the energy crisis generated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Faced with natural gas shortages, several E.U. nations are reopening coal plants and appealing to countries in Africa and elsewhere for new gas supplies. The think tank Ember Climate estimates that European governments will spend more than $48 billion this winter on new or expanded fossil fuel infrastructure and supplies.

Time will tell if these investments are a temporary blip or will undermine national climate targets. At the same time, we recognize that Europe is taking unprecedented steps to scale up renewable energy, increase energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption.

The UN Climate Change secretariat will publish a report in late October 2022 synthesizing the commitments made by countries in NDCs and long-term strategies. Given the lack of progress thus far, the UN report is certain to show a gap between countries’ current emissions targets and trends and the emissions levels needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C.

The Glasgow Climate Pact established a work program to “urgently scale up mitigation ambition and implementation in this critical decade.” Earlier this year, countries began negotiations on how this work program will operate, including its objectives, scope, outcomes, arrangements and timeline. For instance, the work program could aim to set goals in critical sectors for 2030. In Egypt, however, countries will start these negotiations from scratch and are expected to finalize a decision on a work program as one important outcome at COP27.

4) Assure that the $100 billion climate finance promise will be met and move forward on new commitments.

Climate finance will again be a key topic at COP27, with a significant number of scheduled discussions and linkages with most agenda items. Developed countries will be pressed to reassure sufficient and adequate financial support to developing countries — in particular, to those most vulnerable to climate impacts.

In 2009, developed countries committed to mobilize $100 billion per year to developing countries to support their climate action. Official UNFCCC and independent reports consistently show that developed countries are missing the $100-billion-per-year target. For example, a recent assessment from the OECD found that developed countries only mobilized $83.3 billion of climate finance in 2020.

Ahead of COP26, ministers from Germany and Canada presented a Climate Finance Delivery Plan, which detailed the failure of developed countries to meet their commitment and expressed confidence that the $100 billion would be met in 2023. An update of the Delivery Plan is expected to be released ahead of COP27 and is set to also shed light on progress on the commitment to double adaptation financing by 2025. The delivery of finance is crucial because it is a symbol of global solidarity and an important element to continue building trust in the multilateral system and accelerate climate action in the developing world.

Multilateral development banks (MDBs) could also do more with their current capital structure, as called for in the Glasgow Pact, and, more recently, through the Independent Review of the Multilateral Development Banks’ Capital Adequacy Frameworks (initiated by the G20). MDBs continue to be an integral part of the climate finance architecture and must scale up their climate action even further, particularly for adaptation. MDB financing goes beyond “climate finance,” so all types of financing they provide must align with global temperature goals and help build climate resilience.

COP27 needs to provide certainty around delivery of the $100 billion by 2023, including by meeting the pledges made in Glasgow to the Adaptation Fund, communicating new and additional pledges to multilateral funds and in bilateral support. COP27 also needs to signal that adaptation grant-based finance will substantially increase since finance for adaptation remains far underfunded in comparison to mitigation. Further provision of public finance, private sector mobilization, improved access to finance, and debt sustainability will all be key elements of the COP27 discussions aiming to shift the trillions of dollars to close the investment gaps necessary to meet the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.

Countries are also preparing to outline a new collective finance goal to go into effect after 2025, with a series of expert dialogues underway. An agreement on the new finance goal is expected in 2024, based upon technical and political dialogues over the next two years, including high-level ministerial discussions. The lessons learned on the provision and mobilization of the $100 billion target are an important marker for issues pertaining to scale, scope, quality and accountability for the new goal, with the potential addition of loss and damage finance as a thematic area.

Additionally, in 2021, South Africa announced a new partnership with France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union to mobilize $8.5 billion to support a just transition to a low-emissions, climate-resilient economy. Turning this announcement into tangible progress requires donor countries to ensure the funding arrangements meet South Africa’s fiscal needs, and for South Africa to articulate an investment plan, which is expected to be unveiled by COP27.

In June 2022, the G7+ noted interest in moving forward with similar just energy transition partnerships with India, Indonesia, Senegal and Vietnam. Whether these partnerships successfully deliver finance and support communities and workers in the transition will be closely watched at COP27.

5) Advance the Global Stocktake to set the pace for climate action.

The Paris Agreement established a Global Stocktake, a process conducted every five years to assess collective progress toward the Agreement’s long-term goals. The first Global Stocktake kicked off in 2021 at COP26 and will conclude in 2023 at COP28, to be held in the United Arab Emirates. COP26 opened the first Global Stocktake by calling on countries and non-state actors to submit information that can feed into the process; technical dialogues will continue at COP27 to consider the information collected.

This year, new and innovative formats of the Global Stocktake — including a world café set of discussions — allowed for interesting conversations amongst countries, experts and non-state actors. Yet the Global Stocktake will need to spend the next year advancing the technical assessment of collective progress toward the Paris Agreement’s goals before concluding at COP28 with a political package that will drive forward action. It needs to do so while considering synergies with several of the other dialogues and processes launched at COP26 — including discussions on the Global Goal for Adaptation, loss and damage, mitigation and the new finance goal — to ensure a cohesive and ambitious response for climate action and support in this critical decade.

Ultimately, it is essential that the outcome from the Global Stocktake is politically relevant and not just an information-sharing exercise coupled with vague, unactionable recommendations. COP27 can help in shaping the Stocktake’s direction by offering the space for countries, experts and non-state actors to develop a common vision.

6) Convert the treasure trove of Glasgow climate commitments into action.

In Glasgow, governments, businesses and other stakeholders made a number of exciting pledges — to curb methane emissions, halt and reverse forest loss, align the finance sector with net-zero by 2050, accelerate the phase-out of coal, double 2019 levels of adaptation finance by 2025, scale locally led adaptation, and end international financing for fossil fuels, to name just a few. But these pledges must translate into concrete action; evidence of progress toward lofty targets must become visible. Discussions around accountability are increasingly important as additional pledges are made.

At COP27, those who have previously announced ambitious pledges or joined initiatives should address progress to date and disclose any barriers. Governments, especially, must demonstrate where they have and have not made progress.

Earlier this year, the UN Secretary-General appointed a High-Level Expert Group on Net-zero Emissions from non-state actors to identify strong, clear standards for the growing number of pledges to reach net-zero emissions. This group has been consulting with a wide range of stakeholders, including on how to define net-zero, governance of targets, alignment with shorter-term targets, and just transition plans, among other topics. The group will deliver recommendations to the UN Secretary General later this year, but can and should also elevate conversations of accountability at COP27.

COP27 may take place against a backdrop of an unsettled world, but it also offers the possibility to foster greater cooperation at a time when the world needs it most. That’s the potential that leaders, governments and businesses should seize."
1065898418,20221003,"BRUSSELS, October 4. /TASS/. Russian Acting Charge d’Affaires to the European Union Kirill Logvinov has met with Managing Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia of the European External Action Service Michael Siebert in Brussels, the Russian mission said in a statement on Monday.

""Logvinov handed over the full text of the speech delivered by the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin in Kremlin on September 30, 2022, thoroughly explaining the decision to incorporate the Donetsk People's Republic, the Lugansk People's Republic, the Zaporozhye Region and the Kherson Region into the Russian state. The official emphasized that ‘condemnation and non-recognition’ of the referendums by the European Union would not affect the conscious choice made by the residents of these regions in favor of Russia,"" the statement reads.

According to the document, Siebert referred to a statement issued by the members of the European Council on September 30, citing ""the EU approach to the current geopolitical situation, and reaffirmed the EU commitment to continue providing Kiev with financial, economic and military assistance."" He also ""announced another package of restrictions against Moscow.""

The Russian diplomat, in turn, ""reiterated the illegitimate and unjustified nature of such unilateral measures, which merely undermine global energy and food security while also aggravating the socio-economic situation of Europeans themselves."" ""It was stressed that we will regard Brussels' continuation of its anti-Russian policy, in particular the implementation of the idea to set up an EU military assistance mission for the Kiev regime, as a direct involvement of the European Union as a belligerent party to the conflict in Ukraine, with all the consequences that this would entail,"" the statement added.

According to earlier reports, the foreign ministries of several EU countries summoned Russian ambassadors over the accession to Russia of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR, LPR), the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, whose residents had voted to join Russia in referendums. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the heads of the DPR and the LPR, as well as of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, signed treaties on their accession to Russia at a Kremlin ceremony on September 30."
1065902672,20221003,"Another barbaric video shows the armed forces of Azerbaijan killing surrendered Armenian soldiers in cold blood. This took place in the environs of the village of Ishkhanasar in Armenia.

Video footage shows a hail of bullets killing Armenian soldiers after the armed forces of Azerbaijan illegally entered Armenia. Other video footage of massacres against Armenians has reached the outside world. This includes the mutilation of a dead Armenian female soldier that is beyond comprehension.

General Staff Edward Asryan (Head of the Armed Forces of Armenia) uttered, I can provide evidence of Azerbaijan soldiers mutilating the body of a female Armenian soldier (they cut her legs and fingers off, stripped her naked, and mocked her even in death).

Siranush Sahakyan, the representative of the Armenian detainees’ interests at the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), expressed her thoughts on the massacre that took place in Ishkhanasar. Sahakyan said, “The video has been studied, verified; it is real. The incident took place at Ishkhanasar on September 13, with the involvement of Azerbaijani soldiers. It is the ‘Commando’ newly created unit, which is being retrained by Turkey, and certain support is, of course, being provided as a NATO member country. And the units being retrained plan and carry out war crimes against Armenians, and, naturally, they are encouraged for these actions.”

In the last conflict, France 24 reports (2020), “… intelligence reports had established that 300 Syrian fighters drawn from “jihadist groups” from the Syrian city of Aleppo had passed through the Turkish city of Gaziantep en route for Azerbaijan.”

Nine soldiers from the armed forces of Armenia were killed in cold blood despite surrendering. The video footage shows a hail of bullets brutally killing four Armenian soldiers. In the last conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, video footage shows Armenians being beheaded.

The former president of Armenia (Armen Sarkissian) uttered: “The international community and structures must clearly and specifically respond to these crimes.”

Brice Roquefeuil, the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair of France, met the Foreign Minister of Armenia (Ararat Mirzoyan). They discussed the ongoing crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh and the armed forces of Azerbaijan violating the sovereignty of Armenia.

The Foreign Ministry of Armenia expressed to the representative of France, “The importance of the international community’s clear condemnation of extrajudicial killings, torture, and other war crimes towards the Armenian prisoners of war committed by Azerbaijan…”

Japan – and much needed – expressed its concern over recent events. Fukushima Masanori, the Japanese Ambassador to Armenia, noted the concern of Japan against the incursion by Azerbaijan into Armenia.

The Foreign Ministry of Armenia said, “Numerous videos regularly publicized by Azerbaijani users on social media demonstrate the war crimes against and the extrajudicial killings of Armenian prisoners of war, torture of Armenian servicemen, including women, and desecration of corpses committed by the Azerbaijani armed forces.”

Modern Tokyo Times recently said, “If the CSTO doesn’t become more active – Armenia needs to look to other nations for adequate support. After all, look at what happened to Armenian heartlands in modern-day Turkey after the genocide. Therefore, Armenia faces a literal fight to survive in such a harsh geopolitical climate.”

Armenians have suffered brutally in history at the hands of the Turks and their allies. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum says, “The Armenian genocide refers to the physical annihilation of ethnic Armenian Christian people living in the Ottoman Empire from spring 1915 through autumn 1916. There were approximately 1.5 million Armenians living in the Empire. At least 664,000 and possibly as many as 1.2 million died during the genocide. Armenians call these events Medz Yeghern (the great crime) or Aghet (catastrophe).”

Breaking Defense reports, “From 2016–2020, Israel accounted for 69 percent of Azerbaijan’s major arms imports — a number that represents 17 percent of Israel’s arms exports for that same period.”

Hence, the European Union needs to address its energy policy concerning Azerbaijan and put enormous pressure on the political elites in Baku. Israel should also look at itself in the mirror because the Jewish Holocaust – and the earlier Armenian Genocide in the twentieth century that followed horrendous pogroms in the late nineteenth century – highlights how much both people struggled to survive.

Armenia doesn’t need to pick and choose between Moscow and Washington – nor Brussels and Tehran. Instead, Armenia needs to reach out to nations that can preserve the sovereignty of Armenia and help this nation at the regional and international levels.

1065903854,20221003,"There is so much ignorance and delusion to unpack here that it will keep Twitter busy for days to come. Indeed, both Ukraine’s president and foreign minister have already weighed in with tweets objecting to Musk’s facile attempt to give away part of their country. It is hard to top the reaction of a parody account: “Elon Musk weighing in on Russia/Ukraine since he is an expert in failed takeover attempts.”

At the risk of feeding Musk’s insatiable love for attention — which is, ultimately, what this is all about — it is worth pointing out that what he proposes is neither practical nor moral. Russia invaded Ukraine and under international law is not allowed to hold referendums on which country Ukrainians would like to be part of, whether the election is supervised by the United Nations or not. That would be like Putin invading Alaska and demanding a referendum on whether Alaskans would like to be part of Russia again.

Given how many people have been either killed or deported in the regions that Russia occupies, it is not clear who would even constitute the electorate: Would Ukrainians who have fled the Russian onslaught be allowed to vote? Ukrainians have already made clear their preference: More than 90 percent voted for independence in 1991 and well more than 90 percent support the war effort today. We don’t need a referendum to know which country Ukrainians would like to be part of: They are showing it by fighting for their freedom at great cost.

Oddly enough, given how much Musk is doing to aid Ukraine with his Starlink satellite terminals, his half-baked tweet shows the insidious influence of Russian propaganda. Was it, indeed, a mistake for Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to transfer Crimea, once a part of the Russian Empire, to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954? That’s certainly what Russian dictator Vladimir Putin thinks, but even in 1991, a majority of Crimeans voted to be part of an independent Ukraine. Admittedly, support for independence was much lower in Crimea (54 percent) than in the rest of the country because of the large number of ethnic Russians, but that referendum had infinitely more legitimacy than the sham vote that Putin staged in 2014 to justify his annexation of Crimea. The European Union and the United States do not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea — why should Musk?

As for the final part of the Musk peace plan: Ukraine has always been neutral, insofar as NATO would not accept it as a member. That did not prevent Putin from invading it in 2014 or again in 2022. Why would a Ukrainian commitment to neutrality prevent further Russian aggression in the future? In March, Kyiv actually offered to stay neutral if it would bring peace — but it didn’t work.

I am only scratching the surface, of course, of the problems with Musk’s proposal, which ignores the fact that Putin just annexed four regions of Ukraine where his troops are rapidly losing ground. On Friday, the Russian dictator said, “The people living in Luhansk and Donetsk, in Kherson and Zaporozhye have become our citizens, forever.” What makes Musk think that Putin would go back on that pledge simply because the people of those regions voted to remain part of Ukraine? Putin has never respected the outcome of democracy in Russia, Ukraine, or anywhere else. (In fact, his Friday speech included a long-winded complaint about how awful democracy is.)

While Musk evidently knows little about Ukraine, I give him credit for good intentions: It is painful to watch the war grind on, at great cost to human life, and it is frightening to listen to Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons. This can lead to a natural impulse to try to “solve” the problem — to try to figure out some magical formula that would satisfy both sides and bring peace. But if that formula existed, it would already have been implemented.

War occurs when at least one side does not think that there is a peaceful way to redress its demands. In this case, there is a fundamental disagreement between Putin and the people of Ukraine: The Ukrainians think they are entitled to be an independent nation state with friendly relations with the West. Putin does not; as he has often made clear, he views Ukraine as a wayward province of Russia that needs to be reunited with the Motherland by force."

A preliminary deal has been struck for the Korea Development Bank to sell two-thirds of its investment in Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) in a transaction that would recapitalize the financially troubled shipyard with new private investors and management. KDB, which had previously said it was making it a priority to sell Korea’s third largest shipbuilder to private investors, has selected a technique typically used in bankruptcies announcing an initial accepted bid and tomorrow will commence a month-long bidding process for a 49.3 percent stake in DSME.

The shipyard and KDB announced that Hanwha Group, one of Korea’s largest conglomerates operating in aerospace, chemicals, energy, and financial services, has been selected and made a tentative agreement to pay $1.4 billion for the stake in DSME. It is what is known as a “stalking horse” bid where one company is selected to establish a base price for the investment. Hanwha had previously in 2008 sought to acquire the shipyard group but was unable to agree on a price. The proposed acquisition is part of the group’s efforts to expand its role as a defense contractor.

KDB will now open a bidding process in which other companies can propose the terms of alternate deals for DSME. If other bidders fail to offer better terms, Hanwha’s conditional investment will proceed. The bank, which currently holds a 55.7 percent stake in DSME as well as options, would reduce its stake to 28.2 percent and Hanwha will take managerial control of the shipyard. Hanwha reports that it expects to close the acquisition in the first half of 2023.

The shipyard reported a financial loss of nearly $1.2 billion in 2021 after strong profitability the year before. The losses have continued to mount with DSME reporting a loss of more than $466 million in the first half of 2022. The shipyard also suffered a crippling strike in July that further deteriorated its financial position.

KDB, which has been the majority shareholder in the shipyard for more than 20 years, said earlier this year that the company needed a private investor to focus on the long-term and enhance its financial position. In announcing the decision to proceed with the offering, the bank said that this would provide for DSME’s current shortage of funds and secure capital for future growth.

DSME has been able to build a strong order backlog during the resurgence in shipbuilding. In 2022, they received orders for 36 ships and one offshore platform valued in total at $8.6 billion. DSME has already reached 97 percent of its order target for the year.

The state-run financial institution and other creditors have reportedly provided nearly $3 billion in support to the shipyard since 2015. KDB recently questioned continuing to provide government assistance directly to the shipyard saying that it believed the company needed to be placed into private ownership.

Previous efforts to sell the shipyard included an agreement to merge DSME with Hyundai. The European Union objected to the merger saying it would greatly reduce competition for new LNG carrier construction."
