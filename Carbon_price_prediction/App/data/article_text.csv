1067137289,20221012,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated that he wouldn’t negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day after Russia hit his nation with the most intense barrage of air strikes since the first days of the invasion.

China said it was worried about the worsening situation in Ukraine after the latest strikes.

Infrastructure was damaged in a new missile attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia, while the Dnipropetrovsk region was shelled by Russian forces overnight, local authorities reported on Telegram. At least 23 people were killed in Monday’s strikes, the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The European Union is weighing handing new powers to its fledgling public prosecutor’s office amid concerns the bloc’s current system is failing to rein in rich Russians trying to evade sanctions.

New powers for the European Public Prosecutor’s Office would be conditional on separate plans to make sanctions evasion a crime under EU law, according to people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were confidential. Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg account for almost all of the €17.4-billion in Russian assets that have been frozen in the bloc so far.

Ships carrying 177,500 tonnes of agriculture products for Africa, Asia and Europe left Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Tuesday, according to the Infrastructure Ministry.

Ukrainian agricultural exports have risen to seven million tonnes since a deal — mediated by Turkey and the United Nations — in July.

G7 leaders condemned Russia’s latest missile and zone attacks against Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and said indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constituted a war crime. They pledged to hold Putin and others responsible to account.

In a statement, the leaders condemned Russia’s “annexation” of Ukrainian territory and vowed that the move would never be recognised, as it was illegal. They also deplored Belarus’s “enabling the Russian war of aggression” by supporting Putin’s forces and allowing them to operate on its soil.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the United Arab Emirates (UAE) could play a “significant” role in efforts to reach a resolution in his war in Ukraine as he held talks with the Gulf nation’s ruler in St Petersburg.

“I am aware of your concerns about how the situation is developing in general and of your wish to help with resolving all controversial issues, including the crisis that’s happening now,” Putin said at the start of their meeting in St Petersburg. “I’d like to point out that it’s indeed a substantial factor that allows us to use your influence for moving toward resolving the situation.”

Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan said that he and Putin had agreed on “the importance of engaging in dialogue to reduce tensions and arrive at a diplomatic solution”, in comments after the talks on Twitter.

Zelensky calls for new sanctions package against Russia

Zelensky urged G7 countries in a video to impose a new sanctions package against Russia and said he wouldn’t negotiate with Moscow as long as Putin was in charge.

He called for blocking Russia’s energy sector to undermine its revenue from oil and gas, and “zero profit for the terrorist state”. He also called for international monitors to keep watch over the security situation on the border with Belarus.

“After the Russian strikes, all the murders, all the abuse of civilians and international law, your societies will not understand you if you do not cut off any prospects for this leader of terror,” Zelensky said. “One person is blocking peace — and this person is in Moscow.”

Ukraine needs more air defence systems, says Stoltenberg

Ukraine urgently needs more air defence systems as deliveries from allies have made a difference despite Russia’s strikes on Kyiv and other cities, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters.

The alliance chief welcomed pledges by the US and Germany to provide advanced air defence systems, noting those provided by Nato allies had helped Ukrainians shoot down incoming missiles. “Of course as long as not all of them are shot down, there’s a need for more,” Stoltenberg said, stressing they also needed more ammunition for the systems.

Speaking ahead of a gathering of Nato defence ministers in Brussels this week, Stoltenberg said allies were also considering increasing targets for weapons reserves as part of the alliance’s defence planning process.

Moldova urged its citizens to save power between 7am and 10am and then from 6pm to 11pm as Ukraine was forced to stop power deliveries to the neighbouring country. Moldova will now have to start using stored gas, already at low levels, to produce electricity, Deputy Premier Andrei Spinu said on Facebook.

G7 will stand with Ukraine ‘for as long as it takes’

Ukraine’s allies would support it “for as long as it takes” despite Russia’s recent steps to escalate its war there, the G7 nations said in a statement on Tuesday.

“We reassured President Zelensky that we are undeterred and steadfast in our commitment to providing the support Ukraine needs to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the group said. “We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support and stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes.”

The White House said it had seen “no indication” that Putin had decided to use weapons of mass destruction, despite President Joe Biden’s warning last week that the Russian leader was “not joking” about a nuclear strike.

US intelligence as of Tuesday morning had not seen evidence that Putin was set on nuclear weapons “at any level,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN.

The US also had “seen nothing that would give us reason to change our own strategic deterrent posture when it comes to protecting our interests over in Europe”, he added.

Kyiv’s emergency services had fixed the capital’s electricity issues after Russia’s missile attacks on Monday and the city no longer planned to limit electricity supply to its inhabitants, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on his Telegram channel. This statement followed a warning from the power company earlier Tuesday that the city would face scheduled outages to ease pressure on the grid.

“As of today I have information that we have already stabilised the situation and as of today there won’t be any blackouts,” he said in an interview with local TV channels.

Other large Ukrainian cities, including Lviv and Dnipro, were still experiencing power issues.

Russia ready to consider Putin-Biden meeting, says Lavrov

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was ready to consider “any proposals” for an end to the war in Ukraine, including a meeting between Putin and US President Joe Biden. However, he downplayed the chances for any diplomatic solution.

“We are ready to listen to any proposals but we can’t say in advance that a specific process will definitely yield results,” he said on state TV. “We need to know exactly what’s on the table.”

“We are concerned about the development of the current situation and call on relevant parties to resolve their differences through dialogue and consultation,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular news briefing in Beijing.

The comments are the latest sign China is worried about Russia’s protracted conflict in Ukraine, although it has refrained from openly criticising Moscow.

A power and thermal plant in the Vinnytsia region in central Ukraine was shelled by drones, the Ladyzhynska facility said on its Facebook account. Energy equipment was damaged.

One-third of the city of Lviv suffered power cuts following the latest missile strikes, Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said on Telegram.

Ukraine reclaimed 62 bodies of its soldiers, including those killed in an explosion in Olenivka in the Donetsk region in late July, according to Oleg Kotenko, the commissioner for missing persons. “We brought back those who were in hell,” Kotenko said.

Olenivka was one of the places where Ukrainian prisoners of war, particularly from Mariupol, were kept. An explosion there killed at least 50 soldiers and injured more. Ukraine asked for the return of its soldiers and conducted difficult negotiations with the Russians, who publicly declined to let Ukrainian authorities, the Red Cross or other humanitarian organisations visit Olenivka.

One of Ukraine’s largest iron-ore producers, Ferrexpo, suspended operations due to limited power supplies, the company said in a filing to the London Stock Exchange.

The company’s core assets are located in Ukraine’s Poltava region, which was among the targets in Monday’s strikes on electricity and other infrastructure. The company said that it had a sufficient volume of its products, either in transit and/or in stockpiles, to meet its expected sales volumes, subject to logistics corridors remaining available.

Ukraine’s regions are recovering after Monday’s missile strikes, with water and electricity supply resuming in the cities of Lviv in the west and Poltava in the centre of the country, according to local government administrations.

Wheat traded near the highest level in more than three months, deepening fears over the outlook for grain supplies from a country once known as the breadbasket of Europe.

Ships are still moving normally from Ukraine despite the missile strikes, according to the UN. However, there is a long backlog of vessels waiting to be inspected in Istanbul. DM"

1067131392,20221012,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán launched an official account on Twitter on Monday, and said that following his first day on the platform, the question on his mind was “where is my good friend [Donald Trump]?”

The populist conservative leader has previously focussed his social media output on Facebook, where he has amassed over 1.2 million followers. On Monday, Orbán’s office announced that he had opened up an account on Twitter, with his first post on the social media platform declaring “let’s make some noise”.

On Tuesday morning, Mr Orbán wrote: “After my first day on Twitter, there’s one question on my mind. Where is my good friend, @realDonaldTrump?” using the former American president’s handle prior to his banishment from the major Silicon Valley social media companies last year.

The Hungarian leader, who was re-elected to a fourth consecutive term in April making him the longest serving national leader in the EU, has been a longstanding supporter of Mr Trump, saying in 2016 that his election to the presidency would mark the end of “liberal non-democracy” and an opportunity for the West to free itself from the political correctness that had prevented common sense governance.

The affection was reciprocated from Trump, who went so far as to jokingly describe Orbán as his “twin brother” during a meeting in the White House in 2019.

Speaking before reporters alongside the Hungarian PM, Trump said that Orbán is “probably like me a little bit controversial, but that’s OK. That’s OK. You’ve done a good job. And you’ve kept your country safe.”

Unlike the majority of leaders in the European Union, Orbán has rejected the push towards globalisation and multiculturalism, emphasising instead national identity and the nation’s Christian heritage. The Hungarian leader has also been a major force against mass migration, choosing to focus governmental efforts on supporting families rather than turning to foreign populations to mitigate the Western demographic collapse.

While he has represented a lone voice in Europe on such issues, with the notable exception of Poland, there has been a growing populist pushback in Europe against the EU establishment in Brussels, with the right-wing Sweden Democrats making significant gains in last month’s elections and Brothers of Italy leader Georgia Meloni set to become prime minister of the EU’s third largest nation.

Speaking to Breitbart News earlier this month, Donald Trump said that the conservative victories in Europe represented a “great movement”.

“The whole thing is a great movement that’s taken place and now it’s happening all over the world,” Trump said. “It’s a very simple movement: Give us borders, give us safe streets, we don’t want crime, give us good education, give us dignity and give us respect as a nation. It’s not complicated.”

It remains to be seen if there will be a Twitter reunion for Orbán and Trump. While the acquisition of the Big Tech giant by Tesla CEO Elon Musk perhaps paving the way for Trump to return to the platform, the American president has previously said that he would prefer to focus on his own social media company, Truth Social, and branding Musk as a “bullshit artist“."
1067144026,20221012,"As in other European Union countries, with the exception of Spain, French pork production has declined since the beginning of 2022, according to a news release from France AgriMer.

French and European quotations of pig carcasses have reached record levels due to the decline in supply and the increase in production costs, including feed and energy. The price of feed reached a peak, at €395/tonne last July.

The profitability of French pig farms remains low, despite a slight improvement compared to the very deteriorated situation at the beginning of the year.

Following the decline in Chinese purchases, French exports of pork and slaughter meat declined in comparison to 2021 and 2020. At the same time, imports have increased and France's trade balance has again become a deficit in value of nearly €110 million over 7 months"
1067147293,20221012,"12.10.2022 03:12 News >> Russia Says It Has Not Received Proposal From TÃ¼rkiye On Hosting Ukraine Peace Talks Russia Says It Has Not Received Proposal From TÃ¼rkiye On Hosting Ukraine Peace Talks Russia has not received a proposal from TÃ¼rkiye about hosting talks between Moscow and Western countries on ending the war in Ukraine, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Tuesday.

""Russia has not received through diplomatic channels any concrete proposals to hold talks on the territory of TÃ¼rkiye between Moscow, Berlin, Washington, London and Paris,"" said Zakharova, speaking at a press briefing.

She added, however, that the situation is developing dynamically and may change quickly.

Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the topic of organizing a dialogue between Russia and the West in TÃ¼rkiye may be raised at a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan that will take place this week in Kazakhstan's capital Astana.

On the European Union's efforts to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Zakharova said Brussels is trying to drive a wedge in the process to oust Russia.

Brussels prefers not to think about the consequences of steps for regional stability in the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, she noted, adding history shows that the EU's efforts have never led to the real settlement of conflicts.

Turning to Afghanistan, Zakharova said the West had been destroying the country for years and in the end stole its money.

""We strongly urge Westerners to fully unblock the accounts of the (Afghan) Central Bank as soon as possible. We believe that such half-measures are the creation of an Afghan Trust Fund from stolen funds...All these half-measures are hypocritical. They are insufficient for a full-scale reconstruction of the Afghan economy and infrastructure,"" she stressed.

Commenting on a decision by Ukraine's Security Service to put her on a wanted list, Zakharova said there is no need to look for her, as her location is well-known.

She warned that such methods may be applied to anyone.

""Aren't you afraid that there is a regime in the center of Europe that professes extremism and terrorism as a state ideology? Do you think they'll ever stop?"" she said.

Zakharova reminded that Kyiv has rejected all diplomatic means for settling the conflict and instead chose methods of force.

""Look at what happened to other zones of American experiments, which first created monsters, and then these monsters got out of Washington's control. May I remind you how Al Qaeda came to be? Remind you of (Osama) Bin Laden? Should I remind you how ISIS appeared?"" she said.

Everyone thought it would only affect those whom these extremists and terrorists threatened and then everyone experienced the consequences of their activities, she said.

Asked whether the recent blast on the bridge connecting the Crimean Peninsula with Russia will affect the extension of the Turkish-brokered grain deal between Russia and Ukraine, Zakharova said it affects more important issues.

She also said that the US is sending conflicting signals to Russia, acting bellicose and inviting them to a dialogue at the same time.

As for Russia, she said she cannot voice all signals that Moscow sends to Washington. -

1067151498,20221012,"Lufthansa, a German airline, set off confusion recently after telling passengers that they could not use trackers like Apple AirTags in checked baggage because of international guidelines for personal electronic devices. Apple rejected that interpretation Tuesday, saying its trackers comply with all regulations.

It does not appear that any other airlines are requiring passengers to turn off the trackers, which have become popular as a way to find lost baggage. Lufthansa found itself in the middle of the issue when reports surfaced in the German news media that the devices were prohibited.

Although Lufthansa said it has no desire to prohibit the devices that it deemed safe, the airline seems to have stepped in a mess based on the reading of obscure international guidelines and regulations, with no clear consensus on what is and is not allowed in Europe.

Regulators in the United States have said the trackers, which use Bluetooth technology and do not interfere with the airplanes’ communications equipment, are permitted in carry-on or checked baggage. A variety of other companies sell similar trackers, including Tile, which is popular with users of Android phones.

Lufthansa said Sunday on Twitter that the trackers must be deactivated in checked baggage on its flights, citing the International Civil Aviation Organization’s guidelines for dangerous goods as well as the trackers’ “transmission function.” Shutting off the trackers renders them useless.

The airline has not issued a specific policy prohibiting baggage trackers. Rather, it says it is at the mercy of the rules. On Tuesday, the airline said it was “in close contact with the respective institutions to find a solution as quickly as possible.” It also indicated its own examination saw no danger from their use.

“The Lufthansa Group has conducted its own risk assessment with the result that tracking devices with very low battery and transmission power in checked luggage do not pose a safety risk,” said Martin Leutke, a Lufthansa spokesperson. “We have never issued a ban on devices like that. It is on the authorities to adapt regulations that right now limit the use of these devices for airline passengers in checked luggage.”

In its statement, Apple said that AirTags are “compliant with international airline travel safety regulations for carry-on and checked baggage.”

The devices use Bluetooth Low Energy, the same technology commonly used by wireless headphones, which are permitted on flights. They are tracked by sharing their last location via a secure signal to nearby Apple devices.

Apple said the international aviation body does not have specific standards for cargo tracking devices, and its definition of personal consumer electronic devices is focused on larger devices, including phones, cameras and laptops. These tend to have larger lithium batteries.

Apple said AirTags use CR2032 coin cell batteries. These small lithium batteries are commonly used in watches and key fobs. Apple said those batteries have been approved for all baggage by the Federal Aviation Administration, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the International Air Transport Association, an airlines trade group.

An FAA advisory from 2017 allows devices to use low-powered wireless communication like Bluetooth on board planes in the United States. In a statement Monday, the Transportation Security Administration confirmed Apple’s view that “tracking devices are allowed in both carry-on and checked bags.”

On Tuesday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said that its regulation “does not in itself ban or allow devices such as the Apple AirTags.” But the agency seemed to kick the matter back to Lufthansa, saying, “It is the responsibility of operators to prohibit the use of devices which could adversely affect the flight safety or the aircraft’s systems.”

The specification on dangerous goods from the International Civil Aviation Organization says that “batteries contained in portable electronic devices should be carried as carry-on baggage,” but that if checked “the devices must be completely switched off (not in sleep or hibernation mode).” It was not immediately clear how the guidelines address the issue of Bluetooth Low Energy transmissions.

But the organization also said in a statement that it is not a regulator and “does not play an oversight role” over the airlines. Rather, its guidelines on what passengers may and may not do, and similar advice from the international trade group, trickle down to the regulators and airlines, which set policy.

1067151500,20221012,"The Kerch Strait Bridge, also known as the Crimea Bridge, became the focus of international attention when it was struck by a huge explosion on Saturday.

The bridge is both strategically vital and symbolically important to Russia, which accused Ukraine of committing a “terrorist” attack by detonating a truck bomb and setting the bridge on fire.

“There’s no doubt it was a terrorist act directed at the destruction of critically important civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation. And the authors, perpetrators, and those who ordered it are the special services of Ukraine,” railed Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Sunday.

Putin launched waves of missiles at Ukrainian cities to retaliate for the bridge bombing, destroying civilian infrastructure and causing an as-yet undetermined number of casualties.

The U.S., European Union, and United Nations condemned the Russian attacks as “unacceptable” and “barbaric.” Russia insisted the missile strikes were an appropriate response to Ukraine’s alleged bombing of the Kerch Strait Bridge and blamed the Ukrainians for escalating the conflict by hitting an ostensibly civilian target.

The bridge in question was swiftly constructed by Russia after it illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Russian media claimed the project was finished six months ahead of schedule at a nominal cost of roughly $3.6 billion (some observers believe the true cost was nearly double that sum). The construction firm is owned by Putin’s friend, political ally, and occasional judo partner Arkady Rothenberg.

Putin was the first to cross the 12-mile span when it opened in 2018, ostentatiously driving across in an orange truck and declaring his pride at the rapid completion of the project, which his state media praised as “the construction of the century.”

“In different historical epochs, even under the tsar priests, people dreamed of building this bridge. Then they returned to this in the 1930s, the 40s, the 50s. And finally, thanks to your work and your talent, the miracle has happened,” Putin told construction workers at the opening ceremony.

The explosion that shut down the bridge that filled Putin with so much pride occurred less than 24 hours after he celebrated his 70th birthday, a fact the Ukrainians commemorated by sending Putin a video of the burning structure accompanied by Marilyn Monroe singing “Happy Birthday, Mr. President.” Despite celebrating the bombing, the Ukrainian government has not formally taken responsibility for it.

The Kerch Strait Bridge has parallel spans for road and rail traffic, both of which were halted after the explosion on Saturday. The bridge is the only direct transportation link between Russia and the Crimean peninsula and is therefore vital for shipping fuel and supplies from Russia to Crimea and its crucial port city of Sevastopol, home of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. According to the Russians, the massive fireball visible for miles after the explosion on Saturday was caused by seven railroad cars filled with fuel detonating.

Russia prefers to describe the bridge as civilian infrastructure, but it has become a vital link in the supply chain for invading Russian forces. Russian troops were sent through Crimea to attack the Kherson region of southern Ukraine. The bridge is still extensively used by the Russian military, which has no comparably secure and cost-effective alternative for moving supplies through Crimea and southern Ukraine.

The Kerch Strait, which the bridge crosses using a small island called Tuzla as an anchor, connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The Sea of Azov is enormously important to both Ukrainian and Russian commercial traffic, whose right of passage was secured in a 2003 treaty after a significant territorial conflict between Russia and Ukraine over control of Tuzla Island.

In 2018, when Russia seized three Ukrainian ships in the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait Bridge was frequently seen in the background of the ensuing naval standoff. Ukraine complained that Russia deliberately built the bridge too low for large ships to pass beneath it as a way to frustrate Ukrainian military and commercial navigation.

The Kerch Strait Bridge is a symbol of Russian national pride, Vladimir Putin’s ambitions, and Russia’s conquest of Crimea, as well as an extremely valuable military and commercial asset. It is also a massive irritant to Ukraine — a perpetually visible insult, a constant threat of invasion that was finally carried out, and an obstacle to navigation.

Chatham House analyst James Nixey told the Associated Press on Saturday the damaged bridge “will have a further sapping effect on Russian morale” while delivering “an extra boost to Ukraine’s.”

“Conceivably the Russians can rebuild it, but they can’t defend it while losing a war,” Nixey observed. Russian state media claims partial repairs have already been made, and both trains and automobiles were able to cross the bridge a day after the bombing.

“The explosion is emblematic of a Russian military in disarray. Russian forces were unable to protect the bridge, despite its centrality to the war effort, its personal importance to Mr. Putin and its potent symbolism as the literal connection between Russia and Crimea,” the New York Times noted."
1067152901,20221012,"LAHORE: Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are believed to be critical for a particular sector and they have played a key role for industrial development in many Asian economies, especially China, SEZs chairman S M Naveed said on Tuesday.



He said that during his visit to Pakistan China Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCJCCI).

Naveed suggested focusing on cluster-based industrialisation, saying it had been a key factor in industrial progress of China.

China initiated to make segments and clusters to setup industries 40 years ago, and introduced new production norms such as mass production and cost effectiveness by using reverse engineering.

SEZs are expanded over four provinces and special areas under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to boost industrial production, Naveed added.

He mentioned that his entire focus was to provide maximum support to all the projects. Pakistan agreed to provide gas, water, electricity and other facilities to factories in industrial parks, and the country was also providing Chinese enterprises with suitable policy packages to attract potential investors, Naveed stated.

PCJCCI president Moazzam Ghurki extended warm wishes to the new chairman of SEZs, saying Pakistan needed to create supporting business climate for foreign and domestic firms to invest at the specified zone.

Senior vice president of PCJCCI Fang Yulong stressed the need to take notice of the resources and provide maximum support to the zone developers to succeed and achieve our targeted goal. Pakistan could look at China’s experience which has drawn the arbitration rules from the West and currently experimenting them at the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, Yulong said.

Madrid: Spain´s cabinet approved Tuesday a new energy-saving plan which aims to cut the country´s natural gas consumption by up to 13.5 percent by March as part of Europe´s efforts to reduce its dependence on Russian supplies.

The plan includes new tax breaks on renewable energy and financial incentives to encourage more households to use solar panels and install smart meters, the energy ministry said in a statement. Unlike old-style meters with spinning dials, smart meters give real-time consumption data that can encourage consumers to reduce usage. They also eliminate costly meter reading visits.

More financing will also be available for small- and medium-sized businesses to help them to adopt energy efficiency measures and renewable energy.

The plan also calls on Spain to increase its capacity to export gas to other European Union member states.

It includes measures to increase by 18 percent Spain´s ability to send gas by pipeline to France across the Pyrenees mountain range, and an expansion in loading capacity for boats carrying gas to other EU countries, among them Italy. The EU has asked member states to cut gas use from August to March by up to 15 percent, although for some countries less exposed to Russian energy dependence the figure is lower, as in the case of Spain, which agreed to cut use by 7.0 percent."

1067154521,20221012,"Israel has become an energy powerhouse in the Mediterranean region. Last quarter, the country signed a Mediterranean natural gas agreement with the European Union, which marks a new partnership for Israel with Egypt and other Middle Eastern nations that will benefit their economies. In June, the EU reached an agreement with Israel and Egypt to sell Israeli gas to southern Europe. In August, Israel and Turkey normalized relations with the future possibility of a second natural gas deal for the EU. These relationships continue to enhance Israel’s global standing.

Forty percent of the EU’s natural gas originates in Russia. Ukraine’s transit pipelines permit Russian gas to flow to the EU, with Ukraine collecting revenues. Natural gas from Russia also flows through the Nord Stream I pipeline to Germany and the EU, with three recent major pipeline breaches in Nord Stream I and II. Russia is using natural gas as an economic weapon against Ukraine and the EU by reducing or stopping the flows. This has resulted in higher global energy prices.

The EU has been negotiating with the US, Qatar, Norway, Algeria, and Azerbaijan, for alternative energy resources. The EU is looking to purchase larger quantities of the more expensive liquified natural gas (LNG). In the June agreement made between Israel, Egypt, and the EU, Chevron will provide Israeli natural gas to the EU by building on Israel’s existing energy partnership with Egypt. The new EU agreement will also bolster Egypt’s weak economy.

Israel has become independent in meeting its natural gas needs, while providing excess gas through existing pipelines to Jordan, Syria, and Egypt. In 2016, Israel discovered natural gas deposits in the Leviathan Basin, about 80 kilometers (50 miles west) of Haifa in the eastern Mediterranean. There are currently three major gas fields – Leviathan, Tamar, and Karish. In 2020, Chevron acquired Israel’s natural gas operator, Texas-based Noble Energy.

In supplementing the EU’s energy needs, Israel will be aiding Jordan’s economy with additional revenues from excess natural gas flowing through transit pipelines from Israel, through Jordan, to the northern Mediterranean shores of Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. Gas use in these countries is highest during the day. Excess gas can be pumped to Egypt at night during low utilization, which is then sold to the EU.

Egypt converts Israel’s natural gas to LNG in specialized terminals and ships the gas in special transport containers. Seaport terminals in Italy and Greece will receive the LNG, where it is converted to pressurized natural gas that flows through pipelines to southern Europe. In the long run, a more direct subsea pipeline could be built between Israel’s natural gas platforms to Egypt’s LNG terminals. Israel’s partnership with Egypt will bring additional energy revenues to Italy and Greece, further supporting their economies.

Turkey is also interested in a pipeline deal with Israel to service the EU. Given the country’s floundering economy, Turkey would benefit from additional Israeli natural gas pipeline revenues. The recent August signing of a normalization agreement between the two nations may open such future discussions. An earlier EastMed Pipeline deal could be resurrected were Turkey involved and if longstanding tensions between Israel and Turkey were to subside.

Turkey is already a major gas transit hub, with pipelines extending from Azerbaijan and Russia to southern Europe, creating the recent impetus for Turkey to normalize relations with Israel. Piped natural gas, in the long run, is cheaper for the EU than purchasing LNG. A subsea pipeline from Israeli gas platforms to southern Turkey, via Cyprus, would be less costly to build than the original EastMed pipeline between Israel and the EU—$2 billion as opposed to $7 billion. Such a future pipeline would connect with east-west gas transit lines across Turkey to serve southern Europe and the Balkans.

Recognizing the opportunity to build an economic alliance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) facilitated relations between Israel and Turkey. In 2020, Israel signed the Abraham Accords with the UAE, Bahrain, and later, signed normalization agreements with Sudan and Morocco. In 2021, the UAE invested $1 billion in Israel’s Tamar natural gas platform under its trade agreements. In November 2021, UAE’s President visited Turkey and invested $10 billion in Turkey’s faltering economy in exchange for Erdoğan rebuilding his relationship with Israel.

Israel’s experience with Turkey over Mediterranean natural gas has been tense. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan opposed Israel’s signing the EastMed agreements (2020-21) with Cyprus, Greece, and Italy to build a subsea pipeline to southern Europe. The EU and US originally supported this deal, but the US dropped backing for the project just before the Russia-Ukraine War began.

Erdoğan attempted to block the EastMed deal by signing a treaty with Libya to establish an expanded illegal Turkish maritime corridor into the Mediterranean, then claiming a new Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). By preventing access through Turkey’s alleged EEZ, construction of the pipeline from Israel and Cyprus to Greece could be obstructed. When the US pulled its support for the EastMed deal in January 2022, the US had been pressuring Turkey to provide advanced drones to Ukraine. One month later, Turkey agreed to provide this technology to Ukraine.

Following these events, relations between Israel and Turkey improved. In March 2022, President Isaac Herzog visited Erdoğan in Turkey. In May, Turkey sent their foreign minister to Israel for the first time in fifteen years. In June, Yair Lapid went to Turkey, which led to August’s normalization between the two countries. In September, Israel appointed Irit Lillian, as the new ambassador to Turkey. Israel has not sent an ambassador since 2018.

Addressing joint security issues is an initial priority to begin normalizing Israeli-Turkish relations. Iranians threatened to kidnap Israeli tourists this past June in Istanbul. Working together, Israel and Turkey prevented serious consequences. Security is a common concern between the two nations as neither desires the terrorist axis between Russia, Syria, and Iran to strengthen in the Middle East.

Erdoğan also needs to stabilize political relations with other countries and groups impacting Israel. Seen as an opportunist, Erdoğan leans at times toward Russia, which competes to provide natural gas, and at other times toward the US and the EU. As a political fundamentalist, he has moved Turkey further away from secular democracy, while backing Israel’s enemies, Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. Erdoğan speaks out regularly against Israel, while supporting Hamas terrorists living in Turkey. Therefore, Israel should not consider a pipeline deal without Erdoğan first eradicating support for Hamas and the associated extremists in Turkey.

By leveraging natural gas alliances with Middle Eastern and European member nations, Israel has become a major energy player in the Mediterranean region. Israel supports other Arab nations, such as Jordan and Egypt, with energy resources to improve their economies. The growing relationship with Turkey has the potential for strengthening over time. Israel’s resulting economic alignments will position the nation for expanding its future development opportunities with the European Union."
1067156554,20221012,"Clashes between protesters and security forces persisted across Iran on Tuesday, with social media videos showing tanks being transported to Kurdish areas, which have been a focal point of the crackdown on protests over Mahsa Amini's death in custody.

Protests calling for the fall of the clerical establishment have swept Iran since Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, died on Sept. 16 while being detained by the morality police in Tehran for ""inappropriate attire"".

While observers do not believe the unrest, now in its fourth week, is close to toppling the government, the protests mark one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution, with reports of strikes spreading to the vital energy sector.

The authorities are waging a deadly crackdown. Videos on social media showed trucks moving dark green tanks to Kurdish areas, raising the stakes in the revolt. Reuters could not verify the video footage.

Tensions have been especially high in Kurdish regions, given Amini's ethnic background. Human rights groups say Iran's Kurdish minority of more than 10 million has long been oppressed - a charge the Islamic Republic denies.

The Hengaw human rights group reported ""intense conflict"" on Tuesday between protesters and security forces in three cities in Kurdistan province: Sanandaj, Baneh and Saqez, where Amini was buried last month.

Protesters in Saqez set fire to a statue of local members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, Hengaw said.

In video footage shared on the widely followed Twitter account group Tavsir1500 from Sanandaj, shooting could be heard and women screaming. Reuters could not independently verify the footage from Hengaw or Tasvir1500.

At least 185 people, including 19 minors, have been killed, hundreds injured and thousands have been arrested by the security forces, according to rights groups. The government says more than 20 members of the security forces have been killed.

Iranian authorities have said they will investigate civilian deaths.

They have blamed the violence on an array of enemies, including armed Iranian Kurdish dissidents, with the Revolutionary Guards attacking their bases in neighbouring Iraq a number of times during the latest unrest.

Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi reiterated accusations that Iranian Kurdish dissident groups were supporting the protests and said security forces would ""neutralize the desperate anti-revolutionary effort"".

Energy installations in southwest Iran were hit by strikes for a second day on Tuesday, with workers protesting at the Abadan oil refinery, Kangan, and the Bushehr petrochemical plant, according to the Tavsir1500 Twitter account.

Videos posted on the account showed a few dozen workers chanting ""Death to the dictator,"" referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

A regional official said the workers at the Assaluye plant were angered by a dispute over wages and were not protesting over Amini's death.

Governor Ali Hashemi said some Iranians had tried to hijack the workers' protests by chanting anti-government slogans, according to Iran’s Young Journalists Club News Telegram account.

It was a combination of mass protests and strikes by oil workers and bazaar merchants that helped to propel the Shi'ite clergy to power in the Iranian revolution four decades ago.

Dozens of universities are also currently on strike, with students playing a pivotal role in the protests.

In several neighborhoods of Tehran, such as Shahrak'e Gharb and Narmak, witnesses said people chanted ""Death to Khamenei"" from rooftops after nightfall. Videos on social media showed demonstrations in the cities of Isfahan and Qom with protesters cursing and throwing stones at security forces.

The authorities' crackdown on protesters has prompted some Western states to draw up more sanctions on Iran, stoking diplomatic tensions at a time when talks to revive Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers are at a standstill.

France's foreign minister said on Tuesday five of its nationals were being held in Iran and the European Union had agreed the technical aspects to impose sanctions on Tehran, which would come into force next week.

France lashed out at Iran on Oct. 6, accusing it of ""dictatorial practices"" and taking its citizens hostage after a video was aired in which a French couple appeared to confess to spying."

In Tunisia, the jasmine has faded

The European Union and its dissonance

Civil wars in Syria and Libya, endless conflicts in Palestine and Western Sahara, failed states such as Lebanon, authoritarian regimes in Egypt and Algeria, and recurrent migratory crises are all upheavals that have created a periphery of chaos in the European Union's southern neighbourhood. It is struggling to respond to it, from "" Arab Springs "" to authoritarian autumns, in the face of the geopolitics of Moscow, Ankara and Teheran, which are fuelling conflict. And all of this whilst dealing with ambiguous partners between Russia and the West. Regional integration initiatives have been forgotten, while Algiers and Rabat are engaged in an arms race. The spectacular, sudden emergence of China has marked the past decade and illegal immigration remains a contentious issue. The New Agenda for the Mediterranean , welcomed by the Council on 19 April 2021, proposes excellent cooperation measures. But it does not have the means to achieve its ambitions. And it fails to address the most vexing issues [1] The European Union's relations with the southern shore of the Mediterranean are governed by the bilateral association agreements negotiated in the 1990s and 2000s [2] . Instead of modernising the 1995 partnership, the EU replaced it in 2004 with the neighbourhood policy devised for its eastern partners. However, its ""standard action plans"" overlooked the differences. Moreover, ignoring the socio-cultural contexts, it focused on shared values, which became ever weaker as power became authoritarian - in Tunis as in Cairo - and as Islamist movements have gained influence. Faced with the ""Arab Spring"", a new response to a changing neighbourhood was launched in 2011 in which universal values replaced shared values.The latter are however established with countries with a specific status such as Morocco, where the declaration for an """" in 2008 followed King Mohamed VI's wish to achieve ""more than association, less than membership"". The 2013-2017 plan highlighted an area of shared values and a common economic area. The joint declaration of the 14th Association Council goes further by laying the foundations for a long-term relationship for """".The same applies to Tunisia where the privileged partnership, in 2012, set political (governance, rule of law, democracy), security and migration cooperation as priorities. Jordan was granted an """" in 2010, emphasising its role in stability in the Middle East. In 2016, the European Union concluded a Pact for Jordan as well as for Lebanon, to help them cope with the influx of refugees from Iraq and Syria.The European Union has always prioritised investment and trade as factors of stability, development and democracy. The Council gave the Commission a mandate in 2011 to negotiate deep and comprehensive free trade agreements (DCFTAs) with Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan, as it had done with the Eastern Partnership countries. The aim was to integrate their economies with that of the European Union by establishing a common normative space. But neither Jordan nor Egypt showed any interest. As for negotiations with Tunisia and Morocco, they stalled over their fear that their industries and services would be absorbed by those of the more competitive European Union. The fourth round of negotiations with Tunisia in 2019 was not successful. Yet the EU has said it is willing to negotiate asymmetrical agreements. Why did the New Mediterranean Agenda not spell out these principles or propose a new type of approach?Differentiation and flexibility became the watchwords in the 2015 review of the neighbourhood policy, with the recognition that """". Primacy was given to stabilisation, security and the interests of the European Union, anticipating the European Security Strategy the following year. It is true that civil wars were raging in Syria and Libya, causing an unprecedented wave of migration in 2015 and that terrorist attacks were causing havoc on both sides of the Mediterranean.In 2011, the Council mandated the Commission to negotiate """" along three lines: assistance with migration and border management, facilitation of visa procedures, and readmission agreements for illegal migrants. Morocco and Tunisia have signed declarations with the Commission, but none of them have been successful so far. At issue is the refusal to readmit non-nationals who have transited through the partner countries, which argue that it is difficult to prove transit and that they fear creating tensions with the countries of origin, their southern neighbours. There is also the political difficulty of accepting the return of nationals who have left everything behind in the hope of a better life.Another reason emerged after Turkey's blackmail of the European Union in 2015, which was emulated by others. Hence; in May 2021, when Spain agreed to allow the medical treatment in Madrid of Polisario Front leader, Brahim Ghali: Morocco let thousands of migrants cross the fence of the Ceuta enclave. Then there was the crisis between France and Algeria, when Paris halved the number of visas granted after Algiers refused to readmit migrants who had been denied asylum. And so, the partners hold the Member States concerned hostage to obtain financial compensation, among other things, and to influence their policy. Spain's alignment with Morocco's plan for Western Sahara ended the dispute.EU development aid will only have an impact in the long term and only if fertility rates are drastically reduced through proactive policies. In Egypt, where a fertility rate of 3.2 (2020) means that 2 million births are expected yearly to add to the existing 100 million, the problem was already apparent in the 1960s and 1970s [3] . This led President al-Sissi to say that """". While the rate has dropped in Tunisia to 2.2 and in Morocco to 2.4, it is still 2.9 in Algeria. As a result, there are many young people without jobs or hope, who only aspire to cross the Mediterranean Sea since demography won the economic battle long ago. The High Representative acknowledged in his blog that """". It is regrettable that the New Agenda for the Mediterranean overlooks this vital issue.Yet the figures speak for themselves. According to Eurostat, Tunisia accounted for 8.3%, Morocco 8.2%, Algeria 6.9% and Egypt 4.6% of the illegal border crossings in 2021. In addition to this, there are those who use the southern neighbourhood as a transit region, coming from Sahelian and sub-Saharan Africa, who represented more than half of the illegal migrants entering through the central and western Mediterranean Sea in 2021. In 2019, according to the UNHCR, 250,000 migrants were living in Egypt, with the aim of reaching Europe. The continent's recurrent wars, lack of jobs and the effects of climate change will amplify these migratory flows in the future. The Commission must therefore pursue a determined policy using all the means at its disposal. A new dialogue was launched in July 2022 with Morocco, which received €360 million for this purpose, and Tunisia €93 million under the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa agreed at the Valletta summit in 2015. And a link has been introduced in the Visa Code between visa issuance and readmission.Without effective policies with its partners, how can the European Union achieve the acceptance of a controlled migration and asylum policy, as stated in New Pact on Migration and Asylum ? The Union certainly needs workers. But this presupposes controlled migration, otherwise societal divisions will further strengthen extreme political movements, as the recent elections in Sweden and Italy have just shown. There is a need to move from imposed emigration, to chosen migration. The transition will be all the more difficult as conflicts on the EU's doorstep continue to fuel illegal migration.The wars in Syria and Libya cannot be used to disqualify the Union's policy. This would imply that it could have an influence in the face of fundamental movements and internationalisation that have been beyond its control. It has never had a hand in Syria, but it has launched a large-scale aid policy with total commitments of €27.4 billion for Syrian refugees in the countries where they have been living since 2011, particularly in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, as well as for humanitarian aid in Syria. In Libya it launched the Berlin Process for all actors to pledge """". And it set up the EUNAVFOR-MED Operation IRINI to monitor the UN arms embargo. But neither Russia with its ""private"" Wagner Group, nor Turkey with its Syrian proxies have honoured their commitments. Ankara intervened militarily after signing a cooperation and security agreement with Tripoli in 2019. In exchange Recep Tayyip Erdogan took advantage of the Libyan Prime Minister's weakness to wrest from him an agreement that modifies the exclusive economic zones, in defiance of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. How can the New Agenda for the Mediterranean allow such behaviour, which is contrary to international law by a country that is still a candidate for accession to the EU?Although it has escaped another bloody conflict, Lebanon is nevertheless the victim of a latent civil war, largely fuelled by the Shiite Hezbollah, aided by Iran. In simple terms, its three main components (Shiites, Sunnis, Christians) neutralise its political system, perpetuate clientelism and corruption, and maintain irresponsibility. This is what a powerful youth protest movement denounced in 2019. Proof of this was given on 4 August 2020 with the explosion of the silos in the port of Beirut which disfigured the ""Pearl of the Orient"". This triggered an acceleration of an economic and financial crisis that plunged the country of the Cedar into misery and despair. The reform framework developed by the United Nations, the World Bank and the European Union in December 2020 is still waiting for the one who has the courage to take up the country's challenges. Hezbollah emerged weakened from the May 2022 parliamentary elections and civil society entered parliament, but Lebanon continues to witness the exodus of its young people.In Egypt, the electoral victory of the Muslim Brotherhood was short-lived, with the removal of President Mohamed Morsi by the army on 30 June 2013. The latter became the """" in the 2019 Constitution, under the leadership of Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sissi. How could the army let power slip from its hands whilst it controls nearly 60% of the economy? But the lack of competition, the decrease in foreign investment, the decline in tourism due to terrorist attacks and the health crisis, as well as the economy's lost race with demographics, have turned Egypt into a "" [4] "". Highly dependent on external funding, Cairo has to service a debt equal to 36% of the annual budget. The poverty rate has risen from 16.7% in 2000 to 32.5% in 2018. Egypt is nevertheless one of the main buyers of arms in Africa. But it is """". The president is using the threat of migration and the return of Islamists as blackmail. Like Hosni Mubarak said before him, it's ""them or us"". He rules with the army and the powerful intelligence services. And the prisons are full, so much so that Ramy Shaath, a political prisoner released in January 2022, accused Egypt of having become a "" [5] "".President al-Sissi surprised many by launching a national dialogue in April 2022 to help Egypt transform the country into a """". He also reactivated the Pardon Committee to recommend the release of prisoners. Restoring the country's international image to obtain more aid and preparing it for difficult social measures before an extremely serious economic situation seem to be the two reasons for this dialogue [6] . The Muslim Brotherhood have been excluded, as well as those who do not accept the amended Constitution that allows the President to remain in power until 2032. The opposition is divided.One party has agreed to participate in the dialogue despite the uncertainty of how it will be conducted. The Civil Democratic Movement also accepts it but on condition of transparency and rights equivalent to those of the regime. A third group poses three main conditions: the release of political prisoners, the end of the blocking of Internet sites, and investigations into disappearances.Given this situation, the European Union is focusing on the stability of this country, which is too important for it to be criticised in view of its foreign policy, its fight against terrorism and its control of emigration. France is a major supplier of arms, followed by Germany. During the 9th session of the Association Council , High Representative, Josep Borrell, said that both sides will """". But, its only point 40 of the declaration, that expresses its """". The main part of the text concerns support to Egypt's 2030 Vision-Sustainable Development Strategy with €240 million by 2024. The grant-investment mix, so much praised by the European Commissioner, is limited by military control over much of the economy.In Algeria, the army also rules supreme. The Movement/Hirak, born in February 2019, secured the resignation of President Bouteflika. But it has run out of steam amid repression and the suspension of opposition parties and groups since the election of President Tebboune by 58% of the vote, but with a record abstention of 60%. With a political system blocked by the old guard in power and an economy in a state of quasi-autarchy, Algeria is no longer able to offer hope and jobs to its youth, who dreams of finding them on the other side of the Mediterranean. Hence, the government is playing the nationalist card again since the double shock of Donald Trump's recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara and the close cooperation engaged by Rabat with Israel, including of a military nature after the signature of an agreement with Benny Ganz in November 2021.Although the European Union has remained cautious about Hirak, the Association Council has not convened since 2017. Will this "" [7] "" be overcome with the new agreement sought by President Tebboune? The European Union is all the more reluctant to criticise since Algeria has become very popular for its gas since the war in Ukraine.No country has been more praised by the European Union than Tunisia after its ""Jasmine Revolution"" in terms of its moderation and reforms. Europe provided it with €1.6 billion in grants and soft loans from 2014 to 2020. But the terrorist attacks and the health crisis have plunged the country into a serious economic crisis. Parliamentary wrangling, lack of clear leadership and polarisation between the Islamist Ennadha party and others have left it without vision and measures for recovery. Per capita income has fallen by more than 20% since 2011. This has led to a social crisis in which the state is no longer able to play its role as provider, since in Tunisia as elsewhere, freedom without bread does not seduce the people for long.The country was ready to welcome a strong leader, but President Kaïs Saïed suspended parliament on 25 July 2021 and seized all powers because of an """", according to Article 80 of the Constitution. The Constitution has since been amended by referendum to give him full powers and allow him to rule by decree. Members of the Supreme Council of Justice have been replaced and hundreds of Tunisians have been arrested or prevented from travelling [8] . The Tunisian president has so far encountered little opposition since all previous governments have failed. But the Free Destourian Party, taken over by Abir Moussi, will challenge him, including in the streets. In any event, he will no longer be able to employ his populist measures disguised as policy. But his decisions, as well as the discrediting of Tunisia's liberal evolution, have fractured society, which augurs dark days ahead. Which does not bode well and reflects a loss of EU influence.To avoid financial collapse, the European Union granted Tunisia a €300 million loan in May 2022. The IMF conducted a mission in July to decide on possible support. Algeria granted two loans of €150 million in 2020 and €300 million in December 2021. It is in Algiers' interest that Tunisia remains stable. Hence an agreement to supply gas at a preferential rate until 2030 and assistance in securing the borders which Algeria reopened in July 2022. The Algerian government is also pursuing another objective, that of rallying Tunis to the camp of support for the Polisario Front over Western Sahara. By hosting its Secretary General in Tunis in April 2021, President Said took a step in this direction - to the great displeasure of Morocco - while Tunisia had remained neutral until then.Voting at the UN has revealed the ambiguity of the European Union's partners vis-à-vis Russia. While Syria was the only country to vote against the 2 March General Assembly resolution calling for a halt to military operations and the withdrawal of Russian troops, Algeria abstained and Morocco was not represented. On 7 April, Algeria joined Syria in voting against the suspension of Russia from the Human Rights Council, while Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan abstained and Morocco and Lebanon were absent. Only Libya and Israel supported it.The heavy dependence on cereal imports from Russia and Ukraine certainly influenced the votes: Egypt is 70% dependent on them, Lebanon 80% and Tunisia 50%. In July 2022 Cairo was the first capital to be visited by Sergei Lavrov in his bid to reassure Africa about grain supplies, and an agreement was reached to regulate trade in their respective currencies.But there are other reasons worth mentioning: Russia has regained its position as an arms supplier in Egypt, accounting for 40% of its purchases. The two countries have also signed a strategic partnership and Rosatom was granted the construction permit for the El-Dabaa nuclear power plant on 29 June 2022. With Algeria, Russia has a long-standing strategic partnership in which military cooperation is paramount. During a visit to Algiers in May 2022 Sergei Lavrov confirmed that the joint military exercise, ""Desert Shield"", would take place in November, while Morocco and the United States organise the ""African Lion"" every year. Libya's votes can be explained by Western support for the Tripoli government, whilst Moscow supports Marshal Haftar who has controlled the eastern part of Libya since 2019. Washington had to pressure Israel to abandon its moderate position. In retaliation, Moscow started the procedure of dissolving the Jewish Agency and 12,000 Russian Jews have already been taken in by Tel Aviv.Does the war in Ukraine foreshadow multiple alignments in the south?For Egypt, it has also led to a sharp decline in tourism, since Russians used to represent 30% of visitors. Added to the consequences of Covid-19 and the doubling of the price of wheat, its economy has been further weakened. To support it, Saudi Arabia offered $5 billion in April 2022 and promised to invest 10 more. Likewise, Qatar with 5 billion and the United Arab Emirates with 2. Its stability has a cost, the price to pay is extremely high. But until now, financiers have always come to its aid. Who would want to take the risk of an implosion of Egypt?Understanding that this war, and the risks it entails, would alienate many countries in which Moscow is trying to blame the West and NATO, the European Commission launched a €225 million Food Facility on 6 April. Intended to support partners faced with rising prices, it has allocated €100 million to Egypt, €25 million to Jordan and Lebanon and €20 million to Tunisia. This is not much compared to the €12 billion that Cairo has received from its Arab neighbours, but it is a strong symbolic gesture of solidarity and counterpoint to Russian aggression.The war in Ukraine has raised another question that Elie Barnavi has tackled head-on: ""One cannot denounce what a Russian occupation of Ukraine or part of Ukraine would be without reacting to 50 years long of the West Bank, nor helping to find a solution [9] ""... Rony Brauman has underlined the different treatment on sanctions ""where words that cause annoyance are avoided by western governments to favour used formulations, even anachronistic [10] "". The substantial assistance to the Palestinians via UNWRA (246 million € until 2024) cannot be used as a policy. And the European Union should not be satisfied of its impotence by the mere fact that the Abraham agreements are changing the situation. It is losing its credibility [11] The war in Ukraine has revived high level dialogue between the European Union and Israel. After a ten year lapse the 12th Association Council met on 3 October 2022 where the European Union has ""recalled its strong opposition to Israel's policy and settlement and its determination to see it through a two -State solution"".China's spectacular progress in investments under the One Belt, One Road Initiative (BRI) is impressive: in Morocco, where it has been building hospitals, highways and technopoles in a strategic partnership since 2016 [12] , and in Algeria, which is China's 3rd largest arms buyer. As for Egypt, a key country on the Maritime Silk Road, China manages the ports of Alexandria and El Dekheila. It has invested more than $7 billion and has lent three billion for the new administrative capital where it is building the highest tower in Africa (386 m). More surprisingly, it is with Israel that China has the most significant relations, focused on high technology. It is the country's 3rd largest customer and 2nd largest supplier, after the United States.The European Union's trade has grown much less than China's. China's exports have almost doubled between 2010 and 2020 with Morocco, Egypt and Algeria, while the EU's exports only increased by 22% and 65% respectively and decreased by 48% with Algeria. Conversely, their exports to China were on average only 5% of their imports, resulting in very negative trade balances.The ""successes"" of Beijing's authoritarian regime appeal to the ruling elites, especially as it imposes no conditions, unlike the European Union, remaining neutral in the face of local conflicts, thus gradually undermining European influence. China's influence is growing as a result of the arms race in which Beijing is positioning itself between Russia and the West. It is in Algeria that its orders are the most significant: six warships, an anti-missile system and an electronic detection system after Morocco acquired one from Israel.The New Agenda calls for a """", pointing to an internal problem that Josep Borrell has often highlighted: the """", i.e. a Union capable of consensus on major foreign policy issues. Yet the European Union has displayed its disagreements on Libya and Turkey. This is also the case on Western Sahara.This frozen conflict is leading Algeria and Morocco into a ruinous and dangerous arms race. Since Washington's change of position, Morocco has constantly tried to rally other countries to its """", starting with Spain, on which Rabat has put pressure through illegal migration. These efforts have been successful since the Spanish Prime Minister aligned himself with the Moroccan position on 14 March 2022, immediately provoking a virulent reaction from Algiers: by breaking off diplomatic relations and stopping gas supplies. Germany also took this step towards Rabat. France maintains that the Moroccan plan is a basis for resolving the dispute and the European Union defers to the position of the United Nations. If Western Sahara is "" [13] "". In a speech to the nation on 30 July, King Mohamed VI called on states with ambiguous positions to clarify them and unequivocally support Morocco.The dissonance between the member states is coupled with a difference in position between the Council and the European Court of Justice on the application, or not, of the agricultural and fisheries protocols with Morocco to the Saharawi people, against which the Polisario Front has appealed. In its judgment of 29 September 2021, the Court confirmed the plaintiff's right to act as """". In substance, it annulled the Council's decisions on the two protocols, while provisionally maintaining their effects. The Commission and the Council appealed against the judgment in December 2021. The European Union has thus found itself caught in the contradictions of its model, between its desire to support Morocco through political decisions, and the constraints of international law to which it has subscribed and which its own Court intends to enforce. Extrapolating from law to human rights, we note another dissonance between the principle of reality and the values displayed with neighbours who too often distance themselves from it.Since the war in Ukraine Algeria has been courted by the European Union to supply more gas. These new tensions also negate any hope of the regional economic integration that the Arab Maghreb Union sought in 1989. In 2004 the Agadir Convention, which Lebanon and Palestine joined in 2016, was signed between Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and Egypt with a view to bypassing Algeria. This agreement was intended to ensure progressive free trade, with a harmonisation of standards, and would have been integrated into the Euro-Mediterranean zone where the cumulation of the origin of products was introduced in 2011. Its implementation has fallen far short of expectations and the dream of a large trade bloc has faded.Given the major areas of intervention proposed by the New Agenda [14] , the €7 billion set out in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021-27 seems very modest in relation to what is needed for the European Union to exert its influence. It is true that they are supposed to mobilise up to €30 billion in public and private funds. But this is a very optimistic assumption. It would be a serious mistake not to provide the massive budgetary support that the Maghreb needs [15] . The Council has called for improved and more intensive dialogue with partners to """". Does the European Union have the means to achieve its ambitions if it is to change its declining influence in the region?"
1067162132,20221012,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Union is weighing handing new powers to its fledgling public prosecutor’s office amid concerns the bloc’s current system is failing to rein in rich Russians trying to evade sanctions.

New powers for the Luxembourg-based European Public Prosecutor’s Office would be conditional on separate plans to make sanctions evasion a crime under EU law, according to people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.

The idea comes after the EU set up a “freeze and seize” task force in March to improve coordination among member states, which are in charge of the enforcement of EU sanctions. Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg account for almost all of the 17.4 billion euros ($16.9 billion) in Russian assets that have been frozen in the bloc so far, according to EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders.

The possible new EPPO powers would supplement a draft proposal that seeks to boost EU nations’ powers to seize criminal assets, including those of sanctioned Russian individuals and entities, by extending the list of crimes such as money-laundering and corruption to include the violation of EU sanctions.

Current rules have been hampering more far-reaching efforts across the bloc to go beyond freezing assets. To be able to seize assets the EU needs justification of a criminal nature. Separately, the EU last week adopted new sanctions powers that will allow it to target people and entities that are helping to circumvent the bloc’s restrictive measures.

The Luxembourg-based public prosecutor’s office, which became operational in June, has 22 EU member nations and is headed by Laura Codruta Kovesi, a Romanian who ignited an unprecedented anti-corruption drive in her home country that landed the country’s most powerful politician behind bars.

The plan to beef up the role of the EU institution is still at a very early stage and would require the backing of the bloc’s 27 nations, the people said. The EU’s justice chief Reynders is likely to float the idea at a ministerial meeting in Luxembourg this week to weigh initial reactions, one of the people said.

The EPPO declined to comment and the European Commission didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the possible measures.

1067166155,20221012,"Germany is questioning its military deployment in the Sahel region after anti-Western demonstrations in Niger and a fresh coup in Burkina Faso. There is some support for the Bundeswehr to continue its training mission.

Germany's parliament is debating its deployment of troops to Mali and other Sahel states that are part of the multinational European Union Training Mission in Mali (EUTM) and the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MINUSMA).

""The deployment of the Bundeswehr is becoming more and more of a complete disaster,"" said Sevim Dagdelen, a member of the Bundestag for German's socialist Left Party (Die Linke) and spokeswoman for international relations and disarmament.

Escalating protests against the West followed by a spike in jihadist activities and political upheavals in many Sahel countries forced France to withdraw its troops from Mali in mid-March, putting an end to its Barkhane and Takuba anti-terrorist operations.

Germany has about 300 troops under EUTM mandate and 1,000 soldiers as part of MINUSMA in Mali. When France withdrew its troops, it left the Bundeswehr soldiers without any air cover. However, the German parliament, the Bundestag, voted in April to extend the troops' mission.

Some German politicians were not happy. Dagdelen said: ""Neither the rescue chain nor sufficient protection from the air is secured."" She added it was ""irresponsible"" to leave the Bundeswehr there.

The Bundestag agreed to extend the Bundeswehr mission under a so-called opt-out clause with MINUSMA. Under this agreement, ""measures to readjust Germany's contribution including ending the mission can be called into play"" if the protection of German soldiers can no longer be adequately guaranteed. The resolution thus leaves room for maneuvers.

Meanwhile, attention has shifted to Burkina Faso, which in September was hit by its second military coup this year, overthrowing another junta outfit. The new strongman, Ibrahim Traore, is not expected to hold democratic elections until 2024 at the earliest.

The regime in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, only has about 30% of the country's lands under its control.

Traore vowed to stand up to Burkina Faso's growing Islamist insurgency -- the main reason why he toppled the previous coup leader, Colonel Sandaogo Damiba.

Unlike his predecessor, Traore has not ruled out seeking Russia's help to achieve his goals. There is huge support among the population for him to do so.

Mali and the Central African Republic have sought Moscow's help to deal with their unrest. In return, Russia's private military firm Wagner Group -- accused of serious rights violations -- would extend its spheres of political influence in the region.

With its attention focused on the war in Ukraine, many wonder if Moscow currently has the means to enter into another theater of fighting jihadists.

Nonetheless, many in Ouagadougou want the new junta regime to reach out to Moscow. Immediately after Traore announced his putsch, Alassane, a tailor working in the Burkinabe capital, told French news agency AFP that he ""only sewed Russian flags"".

""There were some orders in bulk,"" he said.

Mali's new military rulers still maintain strong ties to Moscow. Earlier this week, junta leader Colonel Assimi Goita phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin to intensify their partnership, according to Russian media.

Amid the growing food crisis and price hikes, Putin promised to provide humanitarian aide to low income Sahel countries in the form of 300,000 tons of artificial fertilizer.

Despite his renewed focus on Moscow, Colonel Goita's has maintained a working relationship with Germany. In this tense situation, top politicians in the German governing coalition wants out of the Mali mission immediately.

Some strong objections to the mission were recently made in the Welt newspaper by Joe Weingarten of the socialist SPD and Marcus Faber of the business-friendly FDP .

But Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock of Germany's environmentalist Green Party is sticking to the mission. The three parties form Germany's coalition government.

Not just yet

""We currently have to monitor the situation day by day and discuss it intensively,"" Agnieszka Brugger, the deputy head of the Green party, told DW.

That is the current consensus in the Bundestag and in its defense committee. However, Brugger does not see withdrawal any time soon and does not consider it sensible from a foreign policy standpoint.

However, she acknowledges that the involvement of Russian mercenaries will lead to a further deterioration in the human rights and security situation.

""We've been observing for a long time that countries like China, but above all Russia, are also trying to expand their influence in the Sahel region,"" Brugger said.

Such rhetoric does not put the concerns and needs of the civilian population first, but Brugger says it is precisely against this backdrop that Germany needs to proceed with caution.

""We already observe that the Russian operations in northern Mali are taking place with a very high degree of ruthlessness,"" she said. Brugger believes that withdrawing the Bundeswehr will leave the fields entirely to these forces.

""MINUSMA is making a major contribution to stabilizing Mali and the Sahel,"" said Wendyam Sawadogo, a political scientist and conflict researcher in Ouagadougou.

Many expected a clear outcome after nine years international troops' presence in the Sahel. But according to Sawadogo, the negative attitude of the military government did not make things any easier.

In an interview with DW, the expert who works for the Dutch think tank Clingendael warned that the rise of Russian influence in the Sahel -- which is sometimes cited in Berlin as a reason for withdrawal demands -- will increase if the German mission ends.

""International development partners should avoid taking an impulsive stance on the Russian presence. Rather, the European Union should focus on improving its relations with countries like Mali and Burkina Faso,"" Sawadogo said.

More recently, the French engagement in the Sahel was under massive criticism, as a result of which the country withdrew militarily from Mali. The accusation: The former colonial power is primarily covering up its own economic interests with its military action -- now especially in Niger.

Step out of the French shadow

Left-wing MP Dagdelen also slams the French presence in the Sahel.

For example, she cites the fact that France runs its nuclear power plants with Nigerien uranium, while the population of the Sahel state suffers from blackouts and hunger.

""Germany is increasingly in danger of being perceived as an accomplice to the dirty French colonial policy,"" said Dagdelen.

Green parliamentary group leader Agnieszka Brugger admited that there have been shortcomings: Berlin and Brussels have not carried out a comprehensive assessment of France's involvement in Mali for a long time.

""This is something that we should have discussed much earlier and much more clearly at European level,"" said the Greens' defense expert.

""And we would have needed a common European strategy and a stronger commitment from Germany instead of sitting out certain, even difficult, issues,"" Brugger maintained.

For Brugger, there is no question that a rethink is necessary in the Sahel. She considers it particularly important that the civil processes are given even more support alongside the military action.

""It must be clear that security forces can only be trained in a stable political environment, with reliable actors who are also interested in political reforms,"" said Brugger.

""Otherwise it can quickly come to a coup and in the end our contributions do not achieve what we originally wanted, but in the worst case also cause damage,"" she added.

It is not without reason that the European Training Mission (EUTM) stopped working in Mali and is now working in Niger. There is a government in power that is sticking to a pro-Western policy -- at least so far.

Seeking visa facilitation to EU member states, Ankara aims to ensure that visa decisions are taken to the judiciary and the Schengen Information System are standardized for all countries.

Stating that a possible recommendation decision from PACE's General Assembly would raise awareness, Ziya Altunyaldiz, a member of the Turkish delegation to PACE, said,“There is a serious increase in the refusal rates for all countries. It was 4 percent for Türkiye in 2017 and 2018, but is 17 percent today.”

The“right to free movement of persons,” which is expressed in the European Convention on Human Rights and which is one of the main aims of the European Union, is considered a human right, Altunyaldiz noted, warning of the“violation of human rights risk” in case of the refusals' continuation.

When included in a recommendation, member states are required to add it to their legislation, he noted.“After that, we propose the establishment of a monitoring committee to determine whether these recommendations are implemented or not.”

All Schengen countries should have standard, uniform and clear regulations on how the process works, according to Altunyaldiz.

Türkiye also wants the visa process to proceed in a more dialogical manner and the citizens to be able to receive at least a part of the money they pay if their application is refused.

“If one has missing documents and information, a period of time should be given for this and the application not be rejected immediately. Let them complete this as they pay money,” Altunyaldizsaid.

The authorities should get in touch with the applicants, he also suggested, saying,“We want at least partial refunds unless the application is justifiably denied.”

Turkish people spend some 100 million euros annually to obtain Schengen visas, according to Ayhan Zeytinoglu, the head of the Economic Development Foundation (İKV).

Head of the European Union Delegation to Türkiye Ambassador Nikolaus Meyer-Landrut said earlier, the recent rejections were mainly due to fake and incomplete documents.

Turkish nationals need to get a Schengen visa to enter EU countries and an individual visa from the U.S. and the United Kingdom. However, the nationals of these countries can enter Türkiye without a visa."
1067172585,20221012,"Children of my Gaza refugee camp were rarely afraid of monsters but of Israeli soldiers. This is all that we talked about before going to bed. Unlike imaginary monsters in the closet or under the bed, Israeli soldiers are real, and they could show up any minute — at the door, on the roof or, as was often the case, right in the middle of the house.

The recent tragic death of a 7-year-old, Rayan Suliman, a Palestinian boy from the village of Tuqu near Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank, stirred up so many memories. The little boy with olive skin, innocent face and bright eyes fell on the ground while being chased by Israeli soldiers, who accused him and his peers of throwing stones. He fell unconscious, blood poured out of his mouth and, despite efforts to revive him, he ceased to breathe.

This was the abrupt and tragic end of Rayan's life. All the things that could have been, all the experiences that he could have lived, and all the love that he could have imparted or received, all ended suddenly, as the boy lay face down on the pavement of a dusty road, in a poor village, without ever experiencing a single moment of being truly free or even safe.

Adults often project their understanding of the world on children. We want to believe that Palestinian children are warriors against oppression, injustice and military occupation. Though Palestinian children develop political consciousness at a very young age, quite often their action of protesting against the Israeli military, chanting against invading soldiers or even throwing stones are not compelled by politics, but by something else entirely: Their fear of monsters.

This connection came to mind when I read the details of the harrowing experience that Rayan and many of the village children endure daily.

Tuqu is a Palestinian village that, once upon a time, existed in an uncontested landscape. In 1957, the illegal Jewish settlement of Tekoa was established on stolen Palestinian land. The nightmare had begun.

Israeli restrictions on Palestinian communities in that area increased, along with land annexation, travel restrictions and deepening apartheid. Several residents, mostly children from the village, were injured or killed by Israeli soldiers during repeated protests: The villagers wanted to have their life and freedom back; the soldiers wanted to ensure the continued oppression of Tuqu in the name of safeguarding the security of Tekoa. In 2017, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy, Hassan Mohammad Al Amour, was shot and killed during a protest; in 2019, another, Osama Hajahjeh, was seriously wounded.

The children of Tuqu had much to fear, and their fears were all well-founded. A daily journey to school, taken by Rayan and many of his peers, accentuated these fears. To get to school, the kids had to cross Israeli military barbed wire, often manned by heavily armed Israeli soldiers.

Sometimes, kids attempted to avoid the barbed wire so as to avoid the terrifying encounter. The soldiers anticipated this.“We tried to walk through the olive field next to the path, instead, but the soldiers hide in the trees there and grab us,” a 10-year-old boy from Tuqu, Mohammed Sabah, was quoted in an article by Sheren Khalel, published years ago.

The nightmare has been ongoing for years, and Rayan experienced that terrorising journey for over a year, of soldiers waiting behind barbed wires, of mysterious creatures hiding behind trees, of hands grabbing little bodies, of children screaming for their parents, beseeching God and running in all directions.

Following Rayan's death on September 29, the US State Department, the British government and the European Union demanded an investigation, as if the reason why the little boy succumbing to his paralysing fears was a mystery, as if the horror of Israeli military occupation and violence was not an everyday reality.

Rayan's story, though tragic beyond words, is not unique but a repeat of other stories experienced by countless Palestinian children.

When Ahmad Manasra was run over by an Israeli settler's car, and his cousin, Hassan, was killed in 2015, Israeli media and apologists fanned the flames of propaganda, claiming that Manasra, 13 at the time, was a representation of something bigger. Israel claimed that Manasra was shot for attempting to stab an Israeli guard, and that such action reflected deep-seated Palestinian hatred for Israeli Jews, another convenient proof of the indoctrination of Palestinian children by their supposedly violent culture. Despite his injuries and young age, Manasra was tried in 2016, and was sentenced to twelve years in prison.

Manasra comes from the Palestinian town of Beit Hanina, near Jerusalem. His story is, in many ways, similar to that of Rayan: A Palestinian town, an illegal Jewish settlement, soldiers, armed settlers, ethnic cleansing, land theft and real monsters, everywhere. None of this mattered to the Israeli court or to mainstream, corporate media. They turned a 13-year-old boy into a monster, instead, and used his image as a poster child of Palestinian terrorism taught at a very young age.

The truth is, Palestinian children throw stones at Israeli soldiers, neither because of their supposedly inherent hatred of Israelis, nor as purely political acts. They do so because it is their only way of facing their own fears and coming to terms with their daily humiliation.

Just before Rayan managed to escape the crowd of Israeli soldiers and was chased to his death, an exchange took place between his father and the soldiers. Rayan's father told the Associated Press the soldiers had threatened that, if Rayan was not handed over, they would return at night to arrest him along with his older brothers, aged 8 and 10. For a Palestinian child, a nightly raid by Israeli soldiers is the most terrifying prospect. Rayan's young heart could not bear the thought. He fell unconscious.

Doctors at the nearby Palestinian hospital of Beit Jala had a convincing medical explanation of why Rayan has died. A pediatric specialist spoke about increased stress levels, caused by“excess adrenaline secretion” and increased heartbeats, leading to a cardiac arrest. For Rayan, his brothers and many Palestinian children, the culprit is something else: The monsters who return at night and terrify the sleeping children.

Chances are, Rayan's older brothers will be back in the streets of Tuqu, stones and slingshots in hand, ready to face their fears of monsters, even if they pay the price with their own lives.

The latest developments in Russia’s war on Ukraine. All times EDT.

10 p.m.: Russia said it had protested to the Japanese embassy on Wednesday over joint Japan-U.S. military exercises this week in which it said HIMARS rocket systems were fired close to Russia's borders.

""We consider the military exercises that took place as a challenge to ensuring the security of the Far Eastern region of our country and insist on the immediate cessation of such actions,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.

""The Japanese side was also warned about the inevitability of adequate response measures in order to block military threats to Russia,"" it added, without elaborating.

HIMARS are the same rocket systems that the United States has supplied to Ukraine, which Kyiv has put to effective use in attacking Russian command nodes and supply lines.

8:33 p.m.: Ukraine’s prime minister is urging citizens to prepare for the upcoming winter as Russia plans to use “cold as its weapon,” The Associated Press reported.

Denys Shmyhal said on Wednesday that citizens should keep essentials such as warm clothes, candles, flashlights and batteries ready. He says though the power system is currently operating normally, Ukraine aims to reduce electricity consumption in the evening across the country by 25%.

Shmyhal asked Ukrainians, and especially business owners, to reduce consumption of electricity in the evening. He also explained that temporary power outages are necessary to avoid overloading some energy networks.

8 p.m.: Moscow expects Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to formally offer to mediate negotiations between Russia and Ukraine during his meeting on October 13 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Kazakhstan, a Kremlin aide has said.

7:09 p.m.: Germany said on Wednesday it was receiving less oil but still had adequate supplies, after Poland found a leak in the Druzhba pipeline that delivers crude from Russia to Europe that Warsaw said showed no sign of being caused by sabotage.

The discovery of the leak in the main route carrying oil to Germany, which operator PERN said it found on Tuesday evening, comes as Europe is on high alert over its energy security in the aftermath of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine which has cut supplies of gas.

""After removing most of the contaminants from the area near the crude oil pipeline that was damaged yesterday, PERN's technical services have located the site of the leak,"" Polish pipeline operator PERN said in a statement.

""The first findings and the method of pipeline deformation show that at the moment there are no signs of interference by third parties.""

PERN added that it was working to find out what caused the leak and to repair the pipeline.

6:22 p.m.: The EU has agreed on the contours of a mission to train 15,000 Ukrainian armed forces personnel in several member countries, diplomats said Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reported.

A working document on the subject seen by AFP said the EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM) ""would have to train large numbers of UAF (Ukrainian armed forces) personnel in a variety of military functions.""

Two diplomats said EUMAM should initially train 15,000 Ukrainian armed forces personnel.

5:57 p.m.: Ukraine is expected to battle through harsh winter conditions to try to recapture more territory from Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Wednesday as allies announced delivery of new air defenses and committed more aid in the wake of Russian missile strikes, The Associated Press reported.

Military analysts are watching to see whether fighting subsides during Ukraine's tough winter, potentially giving an opportunity for troops on both sides of the conflict to reset after months of brutal fighting since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

""I expect that Ukraine will continue to do everything it can throughout the winter, to regain its territory and to be effective on the battlefield,"" Austin told a news conference.

""And we're going to do everything we can to make sure that they have what's required to be effective.""

5 p.m.: Ukraine will need an estimated $3 billion to $4 billion in external financing help per month next year to keep its economy running as Russia's war drags on, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Wednesday, according to Reuters.

 

 Georgieva said Ukraine's international partners have committed $35 billion in grant and loan financing for Ukraine in 2022, enough to close its financing gap for this year, but its financing needs would remain ""very large"" in 2023.

4:31 p.m.: Ukraine’s prime minister is urging Ukrainians to prepare for the upcoming winter, saying Russia plans to use “cold as its weapon,” The Associated Press reported.

 

 Denys Shmyhal said on Wednesday that citizens should keep essentials such as warm clothes, candles, flashlights and batteries ready. He says though the power system is currently operating normally, Ukraine aims to reduce electricity consumption in the evening across the country by 25%.

 

 Shmyhal asked Ukrainians, and especially business owners, to reduce consumption of electricity in the evening. He also explained that temporary power outages are necessary to avoid overloading some energy networks.

 

 Repairs are still in progress after numerous Russian attacks this week on energy infrastructure, he said.

 

 3:55 p.m.: Rashid is among the hundreds of thousands of Tajik nationals who have obtained dual Russian citizenship in recent years, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Wednesday.

 

 Like many conscript-age dual citizens, he faces a dilemma after Russia announced a military mobilization amid Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

 

 Rashid can either stay in Russia and risk being sent to fight in Ukraine or go back to his native Tajikistan where he faces grinding poverty.

 

 ""We have a relatively comfortable life here,"" said Rashid, who only gave his first name. ""If I go back to Tajikistan, I'd have to live with my parents and sell mobile phones again. But I'm afraid of being sent to war, honestly. I don't know what to do.""

 

 Rashid has lived with his wife and newborn son in Kazan, the capital of Russia's Republic of Tatarstan, since 2019. Two years earlier, he graduated from the Kazan Federal University with a decree in information technology and obtained a Russian passport.

 

 Like many other Tajiks, Rashid says he has had to deal with widespread racism and corruption in Russia. But he insists that ""life in Russia is much better than Tajikistan.""

3:15 p.m.: With nearly 100 grain-laden ships reaching towards the horizon off Istanbul, the U.N. official overseeing exports from Ukraine is asking Russia and other parties to end ""full-blown"" inspections of outgoing vessels to ease the backlog, Reuters reported.

 

 Ukraine has exported more than 6.8 million metric tons of grain and other foodstuffs, about a third of its storage, since a sea corridor from the war-torn country opened in July.

 

 The U.N. says the safe passage deal signed by Moscow and Kyiv eased a global food crisis. But as more shippers have joined, the handful of teams inspecting cargo and crew transiting Turkish waters started to fall behind, leaving scores of tankers anchored in the Marmara Sea.

 

 Amir Abdulla, U.N. Coordinator for the Black Sea Grain Initiative, said he had proposed quicker, targeted checks of ships arriving from Ukrainian ports.

 

 2:30 p.m.:

2:15 p.m.: Ukraine’s state nuclear operator has warned that power outages and other emergency situations at the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant could happen again any time, The Associated Press reported.

“Russia has seized the plant and is not taking any steps to de-escalate, on the contrary, it is shelling important infrastructure daily,” the company’s press service told The Associated Press.

The plant was without external power on Wednesday in the second such incident in five days, raising fears of potential leaks because critical safety systems need electricity to operate. The only operating power line, one of eight, was damaged by the Russian shelling of an electrical substation near the city of Marhanets across the Dnieper River from the plant. The power was later restored after the plant operated on generators for the past 24 hours, Energoatom said.

The press office insisted that the generators can last for no more than eight hours. They said Kyiv has sent fuel for the generators but that the Russians refused to let it through.

There was no immediate reaction from the Russian forces in the area.

Energoatom also said Kyiv continues to control access to the key units of the plant and “communication with the station has not been lost.” There are plans to restart this week at least one of six plant reactors that were shut down on Sept. 11, it said, offering no other details.

1:40 p.m.: The Czech Republic will turn away Russian tourists holding Schengen-zone visas issued by any country from October 25, Reuters reported, quoting the foreign minister Wednesday.

It has joined other European Union member states in tightening entry rules.

EU countries had balked at enacting a visa ban for Russians at the end of August when the bloc agreed to put a tougher process in place. Since then, countries bordering Russia, like the Baltic states, along with Finland and Poland, have barred Russian tourists.

The Czech Republic had immediately stopped visas for Russians, except on humanitarian grounds, after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February. But it had been allowing in visitors at airports who had visas issued by other countries in the EU's Schengen travel zone.



 12:45 p.m.: At NATO headquarters in Brussels, U.S. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that Ukraine wants its Western partners to provide it with a complete air defense system to defend against Russian warplanes and missiles, The Associated Press reported.

 

 “What Ukraine is asking for, and what we think can be provided, is an integrated air missile defense system. So that doesn’t control all the airspace over Ukraine, but they’re designed to control priority targets that Ukraine needs to protect,” Milley told reporters.

 

 It would involve short-, medium- and long-range systems capable of firing projectiles at all altitudes, he said after a meeting of the Ukraine Contact Group, a gathering of about 50 nations that meets regularly to assess Ukraine’s needs and drum up equipment.

 

 “It’s a mix of all these that deny the airspace to Russian aircraft” and missiles, Milley said. “They’re trying to create a defensive system.”

 

 12:25 p.m.:

12:10 p.m.: A U.S. firm supplied networking technology to a manufacturer of Russian missiles, Reuters reported Wednesday.

Since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, American companies have been prohibited from dealing with MMZ Avangard, a state-owned firm that makes missiles for one of Russia's most sophisticated weapons, the S-400 air-defense system.

In a measure of Western concern about the S-400, the United States ejected Turkey, a NATO member, from a joint fighter jet program in 2019 after Ankara took delivery of the Russian system.

But even as the United States was taking actions to blunt MMZ Avangard's business, a publicly traded American technology company, Extreme Networks (EXTR.O), was providing MMZ Avangard with computer networking equipment for its office IT systems, according to emails and other business records seen by Reuters, as well as interviews with people familiar with the matter.

In a statement to Reuters, Extreme said that based on information provided by the news agency it believed equipment ""may have"" been sold to MMZ Avangard using a surrogate buyer. Extreme said the equipment was sold without its knowledge. It added, without providing evidence, that an intermediary in Russia was ""complicit"" in supplying its products via a front company to ""bad actors."" Extreme said it is reporting its findings of these potential sales to U.S. authorities.

 

 11:55 a.m.:

11:40 a.m.: Ukraine's recent military victories against the Russian invaders have been ""extraordinary"" and influenced the course of the war despite the ""malice and cruelty"" of Moscow's latest missile strikes, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has told a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels Wednesday.

Austin was speaking to the Ukraine Contact Group, a gathering of the more than 50 countries on the sidelines of a NATO defense ministers meeting on October 12 to discuss bolstering Ukraine's air defenses amid continuing Russian missile attacks across the country, including the capital, Kyiv, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.

Austin said Russia's actions had further united the international community to support Ukraine's military efforts to defend itself.

 

 11:20 a.m.: The Kremlin says there are no plans for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden during a Group of 20 summit in Indonesia next month, The Associated Press reported.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday said that “neither the Russian, nor American side put forward any initiatives about organizing bilateral contacts” during the summit in Bali.

Asked about Biden’s comments in an interview with CNN in which he warned that the use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine would lead to a “horrible outcome,” Peskov said the remarks were part of “harmful and provocative” Western nuclear rhetoric.

Putin has said he wouldn’t hesitate to use “all means available” to protect Russian territory in a clear reference to Russian nuclear arsenals, a statement that was broadly seen as an attempt to force Ukraine to halt its offensive to reclaim control of the four regions that were illegally absorbed by Russia.

Russian officials then sought to turn the tables on the West, rejecting what they described as false claims by the U.S. and its allies alleging Moscow’s intention to use nuclear weapons.



 

 10:45 a.m.: Russia has depleted a significant proportion of its precision-guided ammunition in its invasion of Ukraine and its industry cannot produce all kinds of ammunition and weapon systems due to Western sanctions, a senior NATO official said on Wednesday, according to Reuters.

The official said he did not know how long it would take for Russia to mobilize the 300,000 troops Moscow is aiming for, and suggested it could take a few months.

10:25 a.m.: Ukraine’s presidential office says Russian shelling in the past 24 hours has affected eight regions in the southeast, while strikes on central and western areas have eased for the moment, The Associated Press reported.

Russian forces used drones, heavy artillery and missiles, according to the presidential office’s Wednesday morning update.

Three people have been rescued alive from the rubble in Zaporizhzhia after over a dozen missiles rained on the city, the report said. A six-year-old girl and two more people were wounded in the shelling of Nikopol, where the attacks damaged some three dozen residential buildings, private houses, kindergartens, a school, two plants and several shops, the report added.

Ukrainian forces say they shot down nine Iranian Shahed-136 drones and destroyed eight Kalibr cruise missiles near Mykolaiv, leaving the southern city without power.

“Russian shelling intensifies and subsides, but doesn’t stop, not for a day the city lives in tension, and the Russians’ main goal appears to be keeping us in fear,” Mykolaiv regional governor Vitali Kim said.

10:10 a.m.: CNN reported Wednesday on a dispute between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and American political scientist Ian Bremmer over whether Musk spoke to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin about the war in Ukraine, and about Musk’s proposed “peace plan” that would give Putin a lot of what he wants.

10:00 a.m.: Ukrainian officials and military analysts say Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the occupied regions in the south and east of the country has slowed down significantly despite Ukraine retaking five towns and villages in the Kherson area, The Associated Press reported.

Russian troops have been re-enforcing the front lines and regrouping following Ukrainian successes, which has forced the Ukrainian forces to ease their advances.

Regional administrator in the eastern Luhansk region says Russian forces there have been building a multi-layered defense line and mining the front line’s first section.

Serhiy Haidai says people in the Luhansk region are moving from the Russia-occupied cities to villages, where they have been settling down in empty houses to “spend the winter in warm.”

Luhansk is among the four region that Russia unlawfully annexed following referendums dismissed as sham by both Ukraine and the West.

“In the south, the Ukrainian army is slowing down the pace of the counteroffensive, because the Russians managed to regroup and put forward paratrooper units, and unexpected issues arose,” Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press.

9:30 a.m.: The German economy will contract 0.4 percent next year and inflation will hit seven percent, Agence France-Presse reported.

The German government forecast came Wednesday as Europe's top economy battles soaring energy prices following Russia's gas shutdown.

""We are currently experiencing a serious energy crisis, which threatens to become an economic and social crisis,"" warned Economy Minister Robert Habeck, as he unveiled the official autumn economic forecasts.

 

 9:15 a.m.:

9:05 a.m.: A Belarus opposition leader says Russia is now de facto occupying her country by deploying its troops there and using authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko as its puppet, The Associated Press reported Wednesday.

Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya urged more support from EU leaders during a two-day visit to European Union headquarters in Brussels. She says “we face an enemy who denies the very existence of our country as a free and independent nation.”

The exiled opposition leader fears that Lukashenko could force the Belarus army to join Russian forces in Moscow’s war against Ukraine. Russia has already used Belarus as a staging ground to send troops and missiles into Ukraine earlier in the war.

Tsikhanouskaya adds the situation has become “dramatic” in Belarus, which has become totally subservient to the wishes of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin and Lukasenko, she says, have “tried to increase and legalize the constant deployment of Russian troops on Belarus territory.”

“It’s an occupation,” adds Tsikhanouskaya. “Our position is clear, Belarus must officially withdraw from participation in Russian war, and the Russian soldiers must leave Belarus unconditionally.”

Tsikhanouskaya fled to Lithuania after Lukashenko claimed victory in disputed August 2020 elections that many thought she won.

8:45 a.m.: The external power supply to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine has been restored after an outage that forced it to switch to diesel generators, U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Wednesday.

""I've been informed by our team on site that external power to #Zaporizhzhya NPP is restored,"" Grossi said on Twitter. ""#ZNPP's operator says this morning's outage was caused by shelling damage to a far off sub-station, highlighting how precarious the situation is.""



 

 8:10 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Moscow is ready to resume gas supplies to Europe via a link of the Germany-bound Nord Stream 2 pipeline under the Baltic Sea, The Associated Press reported.

Speaking at a Moscow energy forum, Putin again charged that the U.S. was likely behind the explosions that ripped through both links of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and one of the two links of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, causing a massive gas leak and taking them out of service.

The U.S. has previously rejected similar allegations by Putin. Several European governments said the undersea explosions that ripped through both Nord Stream pipelines were likely caused by sabotage but stopped short of assigning blame.

While Russia is still pumping gas to Europe via Ukraine, the explosions on the Baltic pipelines have exacerbated acute energy shortages faced by Europe before the winter season.

The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has never brought natural gas to Europe because Germany prevented the flows from ever starting just before Russia launched military action in Ukraine on February 24.

Before the explosions, Russia had cut off the parallel Nord Stream 1 pipeline at the center of an energy standoff with Europe. Russia has blamed technical problems for the stoppage, but European leaders call it an attempt to divide them over their support for Ukraine.

 

 7:55 a.m.:

7:40 a.m.: A drop in pressure was detected in main line No. 2 of the Druzhba oil pipeline, Joerg Steinbach, the economy minister of the German state of Brandenburg told news agency DPA after the operator of the pipeline in Poland reported a leak on Wednesday, Reuters reported.

""The cause of the leak is currently being investigated, we don't have more details yet ourselves,"" DPA cited him as saying.

He also said he was looking at the question of the possible impact on the oil refinery in Schwedt, which supplies 90% of Berlin's fuel.

 

 7:20 a.m.:

7:10 a.m.: The Kremlin on Wednesday said that comments yesterday by NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg could be considered confirmation that NATO is fighting on Ukraine's side in Kyiv's conflict with Russia.

On Tuesday, Stoltenberg said that a Russian victory in Ukraine would be ""a defeat for us all.""

The Kremlin also said that the rhetoric from Western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was harmful and provocative.

""We express our daily regret that Western heads of state engage in nuclear rhetoric every day,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, adding that such a practice was ""provocative.""

Peskov said there had been no attempt from either side to discuss a possible meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden.

6:50 a.m.: Romantic gestures take many forms ... well on Wednesday Ukraine's defense ministry posted a video on social media aimed at giving France a gentle nudge to show its love through weapons supplies after repeated criticism that Paris has not been doing enough, according to Reuters.

The 41-second clip on twitter comes hours after a French security cabinet meeting held by President Emmanuel Macron decided that France had taken new decisions to ""support Ukraine militarily"" after speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.



 France has delivered Caesar howitzers, portable air defense systems and heavy armored vehicles primarily. However, a wave of attacks on Ukrainian cities has raised the stakes, with Kyiv demanding its partners provide more supplies, including air defense systems — something Paris has been unwilling to do so far.

Wednesday's clip made clear to France that Ukraine wanted more than just words and promises. ""Romantic gestures take many forms,"" images on the Ukrainian video read as the classic ""Je t'aime moi non plus"" (I love you ... me neither), the suggestive and once-censored song that Serge Gainsbourg recorded with then-lover Jane Birkin, played in the background.

France's defense ministry announced on Tuesday that it was boosting its support on NATO's eastern flak by sending more tanks to Romania, Rafale fighter jets to Lithuania and infantry to Estonia. It said nothing about Ukraine.

Macron is due to be interviewed on national television Wednesday evening, during which diplomatic sources have said he may outline details of his proposed new support.

France does have the SAMP/T (Mamba) surface-to-air defense system, although quite how many it could provide is unclear. It deployed one such system to Romania in May.

""We have not had any answers from France to our requests on this,"" Vadym Omelchenko, Ukraine's ambassador to France, told reporters on Monday.

6:30 a.m.: Ukraine's defense minister is set to brief the latest meeting of the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels on Wednesday, with NATO defense ministers also meeting there to discuss how to support Ukraine in its battle against a Russian invasion.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Wednesday that the talks would be about how to ""ramp up support for Ukraine"" and that top priority was ""more air defense for Ukraine.""

Stoltenberg said the meeting comes at a ""pivotal moment for our security"" with the last few weeks bringing ""the most serious escalation of the war since the invasion in February.""

He said NATO allies send the message that they are ready to support Ukraine ""for as long as it takes.""

6 a.m.: Ukraine said Wednesday it had retaken five more settlements in the southern region of Kherson as Kyiv continues its counteroffensive despite mass Russian missile strikes that hit the country in the past days, Agence France-Presse reported.

""Ukrainian armed forces have liberated five more settlements in Beryslav district (of Kherson region): Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone,"" the presidency said in its daily report.

""The enemy continues shelling the positions of our units to deter the counteroffensive along the entire contact line,"" the presidency said.

The Ukrainian army announced its counteroffensive in the south in late August.

After regaining almost full control of the northeastern region of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian forces recently claimed more gains on the eastern and southern fronts.

On Thursday, Ukraine said it had recaptured over 400 square kilometers (155 square miles) in Kherson in less than a week, after Moscow claimed to have annexed the region.

Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Moscow recently claimed to have annexed.

5:30 a.m.: Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned Russia's ""relentless bombings"" of Ukrainian cities, saying the attacks had unleashed a ""hurricane of violence"" on residents.

Speaking to thousands of people at his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square, he also appealed to ""those who have the fate of the war in their hands"" to stop, Reuters reported.

At least 26 people have been killed across Ukraine during Russia's biggest aerial offensive since the start of its invasion in February.

""My heart is always with the Ukrainian people, especially the residents of the places that have been hit by relentless bombings,"" Francis said.

""May (God's) spirit transform the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that the hurricane of violence stops and peaceful coexistence in justice can be rebuilt.""

In Amsterdam, prosecutors for International Mobile Justice teams are investigating as possible war crimes the ongoing Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities.

Monday's attacks killed 19 people, wounded more than 100 and knocked out power across the country, Ukrainian officials said. More strikes on Tuesday killed seven people in the southeastern town of Zaporizhzhia and left part of the western city of Lviv without power.

Russia denies targeting civilians in its military operation in Ukraine, and has accused the West of escalating and prolonging the conflict by supporting Kyiv.

Francis directly called on Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time 10 days ago to stop the ""spiral of violence and death"", saying the crisis was risking uncontrollable global consequences.

5 a.m.: A safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Russian-controlled Ukraine is not possible until the front moves forward by at least 100 kilometers (62 miles), Reuters reported on Wednesday citing a state media RIA’s report, which quoted a Russian-installed leader of the region.

""I can tell you that negotiating while the front line is 100 kilometers away from the station ... I think that's extremely unsafe,"" Yevgeny Balitsky told state television.

He also warned that it is not possible to shut down the plant, despite fears shelling could further compromise its safety. ""It's not a toy, you can't just turn it on and off like a switch. There's overclocking, there's cooling and so-forth,"" Balitsky said.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has been pushing for a demilitarized security zone around the plant, Europe's largest, which remains close to the frontline between Russian and Ukrainian forces.

Both Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the plant and the facilities around it, risking a nuclear accident.

The plant was recently forced to use emergency diesel generators after a power line supplying the plant was cut again, U.N. atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Wednesday.

4:30 a.m.: A senior Ukrainian official dismissed as ""nonsense"" on Wednesday Russia's investigation into an explosion last weekend that badly damaged a bridge linking the Russian mainland to the Crimea peninsula that Moscow has annexed, Reuters reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed Ukraine's security forces for the explosion and earlier on Wednesday Russia's Federal Security Service, or the FSB, said it had detained five Russians and three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia over the blast.

""The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,"" Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne cited interior minister spokesman Andriy Yusov as saying when asked about Moscow's allegations on the Crimea Bridge blast.

Yusov described the FSB and Investigative Committee as ""fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements.""

4 a.m.: Prosecutors for International Mobile Justice teams are investigating as possible war crimes the ongoing Russian missile strikes in Kyiv and cities across Ukraine that have so far killed at least 26 people, an official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Monday's attacks killed 19 people, wounded more than 100 and knocked out power across the country in Moscow's biggest aerial offensive since the start of its invasion on February 24.

Another series of strikes yesterday killed seven people in the southeastern town of Zaporizhzhia and left part of the western city of Lviv without power.

War crimes investigators visited sites in the capital and examined damage to civilians and civilian infrastructure, said British attorney Nigel Povoas, lead prosecutor for the International Mobile Justice teams, which is assisting Ukrainian investigations.

""We visited all the sites in Kyiv yesterday,"" Povoas told Reuters.

""Even the claimed widespread attacks on energy and communications infrastructure appear to have minimal impact on military operations and maximum impact on the health, suffering and spread of terror within the civilian population with winter approaching.""

Russia denies targeting civilians in its military operation in Ukraine.

3:45 a.m.: The recently restored power line supplying the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been cut again, forcing the plant to switch to emergency diesel generators, the U.N. atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Wednesday.

""Our team at #Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant informed me this morning that the plant has lost all of its external power for the 2nd time in five days,"" Grossi said on Twitter, renewing his call for a protection zone around the plant to prevent shelling near the facility.

3:30 a.m.: Poland's PKN Orlen said on Wednesday that oil supplies to its Plock refinery were not interrupted as a result of a leak detected in the Druzhba pipeline, Reuters reported.

Polish operator PERN has detected a leak in one of the pipelines in the Druzhba system that carries oil from Russia to Europe, it said on Wednesday. Poland said it was probably caused by an accident, although the event may still stoke concerns about the security of Europe's energy supplies.

The discovery of the leak in the main route carrying oil to Germany, which operator PERN said it found on Tuesday evening, comes as Europe faces a severe energy crisis in the aftermath of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine which has cut supplies of gas in a continuing stand-off.

""Here we can talk about accidental damage,"" Poland's top official in charge of energy infrastructure Mateusz Berger told Reuters by telephone. He said there were no grounds to believe the leak was caused by sabotage.

PERN said in a statement that at this point the exact causes of the leak were unknown. It was detected in a section of the pipe around 70 kilometers from the central Polish city of Plock.

The Druzhba oil pipeline, whose name means ""friendship"" in Russian, is one of the world's largest, supplying Russian oil to much of central Europe including Germany, Poland, Belarus, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Austria.

3:15 a.m.: Russia's Gazprom said on Wednesday it will ship 42.4 million cubic meters of natural gas to Europe via Ukraine on Wednesday, a volume in line with recent days, Reuters reported.

3 a.m.: Ukraine has received the first Iris-T defense system from Germany, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said, according to Agence France-Presse.

""IRIS-Ts from (Germany) are already here. (American) NASAMS are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more,"" Reznikov tweeted late on Tuesday. ""There is a moral imperative to protect the sky over (Ukraine) in order to save our people.""

Germany had promised delivery of the first Iris-T missile shield ""in the coming days"" after Russia unleashed deadly attacks across Ukraine on Monday, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than 100, according to Ukrainian authorities.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said Monday that Russia had fired 83 missiles at Ukraine, of which its air defenses shot down 52, among which were 43 cruise missiles.

2:30 a.m.: Desperate to avoid military call-up to fight in Ukraine, more than 20 Russians have sailed in yachts from North Pacific ports to South Korea, but most have been refused entry, according to a media report.

There has been an exodus of conscription-age men from Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilization on September 21, but most fled by road, rail and air to Europe, and neighboring former Soviet Union countries, like Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.

On Tuesday, South Korean broadcaster KBS reported that at least 21 Russians had arrived aboard yachts at ports in the south of the country, but only two had been granted entry, while others were refused as authorities deemed their purpose ""ambiguous.""

A yacht with five Russian men aboard departed on Tuesday from the South Korean island of Ulleung, having arrived there on September 30 after sailing from the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok, a coast guard official told Reuters on Wednesday.

The official said the yacht was ""taking cover from bad weather"" and the people aboard had received food and other aid, but he declined to specify why they were not granted entry, referring immigration-related queries to the justice ministry.

KBS reported that three yachts had docked in the southeastern port city of Pohang over the past several days, mostly carrying Russian men in their 20-30s. One of the yachts had nine Russian men and one woman aboard, while a smaller vessel had four men aboard, it said.

An official at Pohang's coast guard declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A justice ministry official said he did not have details about the yacht cases, but Russians are in general allowed to enter the country without a visa as long as they obtain prior approval via South Korea's electronic travel authorization system.

2:15 a.m.: Russia's Federal Security Service, or the FSB, said on Wednesday that it had detained five Russians and three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia over the explosion that damaged the Crimea Bridge last Saturday, Reuters reported citing Russia’s Interfax.

The FSB said the explosion was organized by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, and its director Kyrylo Budanov.

Ukraine has not officially confirmed its involvement in the blast, but some Ukrainian officials have celebrated the damage.

The explosion on the twelve-mile-long bridge destroyed one section of the road bridge, temporarily halting road traffic. It also destroyed several fuel tankers on a train heading towards the annexed peninsula from neighboring southern Russia.

The bridge, a prestige project personally opened by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018, had become logistically vital to his military campaign, with supplies to Russian troops fighting in south Ukraine channeled through it.

Russian forces launched mass missile strikes against Ukrainian cities, including power supplies. At a televised meeting of Russia's Security Council on Monday, Putin said the strikes were a retaliation for the Crimea bridge blast, which he said had been organized by Ukraine's secret services.

Agence France-Presse also reported saying that eight suspects have been detained over the bridge explosion.

1:30 a.m.: The European Union's energy commissioner hailed a ""long-term strategic partnership"" with Algeria as the bloc turns to Africa's biggest gas exporter to fill a gap left by Russian supplies, Agence France-Presse reported.

Kadri Simson made the remarks Tuesday and is the latest in a string of top European officials to visit Algeria in search of more natural gas since Russia cut supplies to Europe in suspected retaliation against Western sanctions after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Algeria has helped Europe diversify its energy supplies by pumping more gas to Italy, which in July signed a deal to import billions more cubic meters via an undersea pipeline from the North African coast.

Algerian Prime Minister Aimene Benabderrahmane said state hydrocarbons firm Sonatrach had put in place an ""accelerated program"" to bump up output.

1:15 a.m.: Five blasts were heard in the city of Kherson early on Wednesday, Reuters reported citing Russian media, adding that according to unofficial information air defense systems were launched.

Kherson, the administrative center of the broader Kherson region, was one of the first cities to fall to Russian forces after they launched their invasion in Ukraine in February.

Earlier on Wednesday, Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Russian-controlled Melitopol in the south of the Zaporizhzhia region, said on the Telegram messaging app that there was a powerful explosion in the city.

RIA reported, citing local Russia-installed police, that a device exploded near the city's central market. There were no casualties, RIA reported.

Reuters was not able to immediately verify the reports.

1 a.m.: Spain's Cabinet approved a new energy-saving plan that aims to cut the country's natural gas consumption by up to 13.5% by March, Agence France-Presse reported, as part of Europe's efforts to reduce its dependence on Russian supplies.

The plan announced Tuesday includes new tax breaks on renewable energy and financial incentives to encourage more households to use solar panels and install smart meters, the energy ministry said in a statement.

It also includes measures to increase by 18% Spain's ability to send gas by pipeline to France across the Pyrenees mountain range, and an expansion in loading capacity for boats carrying gas to other EU countries, among them Italy.

The EU has asked member states to cut gas use from August to March by up to 15%, although for some countries less exposed to Russian energy dependence the figure is lower.

12:30 a.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden told CNN during an interview broadcast on Tuesday that he did not think Russian President Vladimir Putin would use a tactical nuclear weapon in the war with Ukraine.

Biden, asked by CNN anchor Jake Tapper how realistic he believed it would be for Putin to use a tactical nuclear weapon, responded: ""Well, I don’t think he will.""

12:15 a.m.: Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthiest nations say they will support Ukraine for “as long as it takes” following Russia’s major missile strikes earlier this week. Western allies are expected to decide soon whether to approve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s request for more modern and effective air defense systems. VOA's White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara has the latest.

12:05 a.m.: Ukraine’s defense minister is set to brief the latest meeting of the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels on Wednesday, with NATO defense ministers also meeting there to discuss how to support Ukraine in its battle against a Russian invasion.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday that the talks will provide an opportunity for Ukraine to present a list of what it needs and see how that matches up with what partner countries can provide.

Stoltenberg said the talks would be about both what types of aid to send to Ukraine and ensuring prompt delivery along with training.

Leaders of the Group of Seven major industrial nations, meeting Tuesday in a crisis video conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, pledged Tuesday they “will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes” after Russia continued its barrage of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

 

 The G-7 leaders said in a statement after the virtual meeting that they had reassured Zelenskyy they are “undeterred and steadfast in our commitment to providing the support Ukraine needs to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity.” They said Moscow’s “indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime.”

1067177654,20221012,"Peter Szijjarto, Hungary’s minister of foreign affairs and trade, said here on Tuesday that he will travel to Moscow this Thursday to deliver a strong message of peace and to discuss ways to ensure Hungary’s energy supplies.

He will be there to participate in the event “Russian Energy Week”.

“It is clear that the escalation in Ukraine is moving in an extremely dangerous direction. Now we are really in the last moment to reverse the events,” he said at a press conference held with Slovenia’s minister of economic development and technology Matjaz Han.

“Instead of escalation efforts and war rhetoric, I think it would be time for us in Europe to switch to focusing all our efforts on creating peace,” he said.

He said he will meet with representatives of Russian energy giant Gazprom, state nuclear company Rosatom and government officials in charge of Russia’s energy policy for talks on ways to prevent an energy shortage in Hungary this winter.

Szijjarto is the only European Union (EU) minister to attend the event in Moscow.

“Those who criticize me for this (participating in “Russian Energy Week”) do not want peace, they are not interested in whether the Hungarian people will have energy supply or not,” he said.

Although Hungary’s government voted together with other EU members in favor of Western sanctions against Russia, it is fervently opposed to extending the sanctions to Russia’s energy sector. ■"
1067181159,20221012,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — A new liquefied natural gas project off Africa's western coast may only be 80% complete, but already the prospect of a new energy supplier has drawn visits from the leaders of Poland and Germany.

The initial field near Senegal and Mauritania’s coastlines is expected to contain about 15 trillion cubic feet (425 billion cubic meters) of gas, five times more than what gas-dependent Germany used in all of 2019. But production isn't expected to start until the end of next year.

That won't help solve Europe's energy crisis triggered by Russia's war in Ukraine. Still, Gordon Birrell, an executive for project co-developer BP, says the development “could not be more timely"" as Europe seeks to reduce its reliance on Russian natural gas to power factories, generate electricity and heat homes.

“Current world events are demonstrating the vital role that (liquid gas) can play in underpinning the energy security of nations and regions,” he told an energy industry meeting in West Africa last month.

While Africa’s natural gas reserves are vast and North African countries like Algeria have pipelines already linked to Europe, a lack of infrastructure and security challenges have long stymied producers in other parts of the continent from scaling up exports. Established African producers are cutting deals or reducing energy use so they have more to sell to boost their finances, but some leaders warn that hundreds of millions of Africans lack electricity and supplies are needed at home.

Nigeria has Africa’s largest natural gas reserves, said Horatius Egua, a spokesman for the petroleum minister, though it accounts for only 14% of the European Union’s imports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, that comes by ship. Projects face the risk of energy thefts and high costs. Other promising countries like Mozambique have discovered large gas reserves only to see projects delayed by violence from Islamic militants.

Europe has been scrambling to secure alternative sources as Moscow has reduced natural gas flows to EU countries, triggering soaring energy prices and growing expectations of a recession. The 27-nation EU, whose energy ministers are meeting this week to discuss a gas price cap, is bracing for the possibility of a complete Russian cutoff but has still managed to fill gas reserves to 90%.

European leaders have flocked to countries like Norway, Qatar, Azerbaijan and especially those in North Africa, where Algeria has a pipeline running to Italy and another to Spain.

Italy signed a $4 billion gas deal with Algeria in July, a month after Egypt reached an agreement with the European Union and Israel to boost sales of LNG. Angola also has signed a gas deal with Italy.

While an earlier agreement allowed Italy's biggest energy company to start production at two Algerian gas fields this week, it wasn't clear when flows would start from the July deal because it lacked specifics, analysts said.

African leaders like Senegalese President Macky Sall want their countries to cash in on these projects even as they’re dissuaded from pursuing fossil fuels. They don’t want to export it all either — an estimated 600 million Africans lack access to electricity.

“It is legitimate, fair and equitable that Africa, the continent that pollutes the least and lags furthest behind in the industrialization process should exploit its available resources to provide basic energy, improve the competitiveness of its economy and achieve universal access to electricity,” Sall told the U.N. General Assembly last month.

Algeria is a major supplier — it and Egypt accounted for 60% of the natural gas production in Africa in 2020 — but it can't offset Russian gas to Europe at this stage, said Mahfoud Kaoubi, professor of economics and specialist in energy issues at the University of Algiers.

“Russia has an annual production of 270 billion cubic meters — it’s huge,"" Kaoubi said. “Algeria is 120 billion cubic meters, of which 70.50% is intended for consumption on the internal market.""

This year, Algeria is forecast to have piped exports of 31.8 billion cubic meters, according to Tom Purdie, a Europe, Middle East and Africa gas analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“The key concern here surrounds the level of production step-up that can be achieved, and the impact domestic demand could have"" given how much gas Algeria uses at home, Purdie said.

Cash-strapped Egypt also is looking to export more natural gas to Europe, even regulating air conditioning in shopping malls and lights on streets to save energy and sell it instead.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly says Egypt hopes to bring in an additional $450 million a month in foreign currency by rerouting 15% of its domestic gas usage for export, state media reported.

More than 60% of Egypt’s natural gas consumption still is used by power stations to keep the country running. Most of its LNG goes to Asian markets.

A new, three-party deal will see Israel send more gas to Europe via Egypt, which has facilities to liquefy it for export by sea. The EU says it will help the two countries increase gas production and exploration.

In Nigeria, ambitious plans have yet to yield results despite years of planning. The country exported less than 1% of its vast natural gas reserves last year.

A proposed 4,400-kilometer-long (2,734-mile-long) pipeline that would take Nigerian gas to Algeria through Niger has been stalled since 2009, mainly because of its estimated cost of $13 billion.

Many fear that even if completed, the Trans-Sahara Gas Pipeline would face security risks like Nigeria's oil pipelines, which have come under frequent attacks from militants and vandals.

The same challenges would hinder increased gas exports to Europe, said Olufola Wusu, a Lagos-based oil and gas expert.

“If you look at the realities on ground — issues that have to do with crude oil theft — and others begin to question our ability to supply gas to Europe,” he said.

Wusu urged pursuing LNG, calling it the “most profitable"" gas strategy so far.

Even that isn't without issues: In July, the head of Nigeria LNG Limited, the country’s largest natural gas firm, said its plant was producing at just 68% of capacity, mainly because its operations and earnings have been stifled by oil theft.

In the south, Mozambique is slated to become a major exporter of LNG after significant deposits were found along its Indian Ocean coast in 2010. France's TotalEnergies invested $20 billion and started work to extract gas that would be liquefied in a plant it was building in Palma, in the northern Cabo Delgado province.

But Islamic extremist violence forced TotalEnergies to indefinitely scupper the project last year. Mozambican officials have pledged to secure the Palma area to allow work to resume.

Italian firm Eni, meanwhile, pressed ahead with plans to pump and liquefy some of its gas deposits discovered in Mozambique in 2011 and 2014. Eni established a platform in the Indian Ocean 50 miles (80 kilometers) offshore, away from the violence in Cabo Delgado.

It's the first floating LNG facility in the deep waters off Africa, Eni says, with gas liquefaction capacity of 3.4 million tons per year.

The platform liquefied its first gas on Oct. 2, according to Africa Energy, and the first shipment is expected to depart for Europe in mid-October.

A proposed 4,400-kilometer-long (2,734-mile-long) pipeline that would take Nigerian gas to Algeria through Niger has been stalled since 2009, mainly because of its estimated cost of $13 billion.

Many fear that even if completed, the Trans-Sahara Gas Pipeline would face security risks like Nigeria’s oil pipelines, which have come under frequent attacks from militants and vandals.

The same challenges would hinder increased gas exports to Europe, said Olufola Wusu, a Lagos-based oil and gas expert.

“If you look at the realities on ground — issues that have to do with crude oil theft — and others begin to question our ability to supply gas to Europe,” he said.

Wusu urged pursuing LNG, calling it the “most profitable” gas strategy so far.

Even that isn’t without issues: In July, the head of Nigeria LNG Limited, the country’s largest natural gas firm, said its plant was producing at just 68% of capacity, mainly because its operations and earnings have been stifled by oil theft.

In the south, Mozambique is slated to become a major exporter of LNG after significant deposits were found along its Indian Ocean coast in 2010. France’s TotalEnergies TTE, TTE, invested $20 billion and started work to extract gas that would be liquefied in a plant it was building in Palma, in the northern Cabo Delgado province.

But Islamic extremist violence forced TotalEnergies to indefinitely scupper the project last year. Mozambican officials have pledged to secure the Palma area to allow work to resume.

Italian firm Eni ENI, , meanwhile, pressed ahead with its plan to pump and liquefy some of its gas deposits discovered in Mozambique in 2011 and 2014. Eni established a platform in the Indian Ocean 50 miles (80 kilometers) offshore, away from the violence in Cabo Delgado.

It’s the first floating LNG facility in the deep waters off Africa, Eni says, with gas liquefaction capacity of 3.4 million tons per year.

The platform liquefied its first gas on Oct. 2, according to Africa Energy, and the first shipment is expected to depart for Europe in mid-October."

Security forces in Iran cracked down Monday as protests and international criticism continued over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained for violating the country’s dress code.

Amini, who was Kurdish, was arrested last week by Iran's ""morality police"" for not properly covering her hair with a headscarf, or hijab, according to a statement from acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif. Amini collapsed at a detention center, fell into a coma and died three days later, the statement said.

Iranian police said Amini died of a heart attack and released footage purportedly showing the moment she collapsed. Her family told local media she had no history of heart trouble and said witnesses reported seeing her shoved into a police car.

Her father, Amjad Amini, told an Iranian news website that authorities pressured him to bury his daughter at night to reduce the chance of protests, but the family was able to bury her in the morning.

Thousands of protesters across the country took to the streets after Amini's death, including those in her home city, Saqez, where she was buried Saturday. Police arrested several demonstrators and used tear gas in Saqez and gunshots and water cannons to break up crowds in Iran's capital city, Tehran, according to videos shared on social media by Iranian journalists.

Women can be seen on video at the forefront of clashes with police taking off their headscarves. Wearing a hijab has been required for women since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Dozens of women also removed their headscarves in protest in 2017.

Study: Half of Iran wants to drop mandatory hijab

At least five people were killed, 75 were injured and several were arrested during protests Monday, according to the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a human rights watchdog that monitors the Kurdish areas in western Iran.

The U.N.'s Al-Nashif expressed alarm at Amini's death ""and the violent response by security forces to ensuing protests.""

“Mahsa Amini’s tragic death and allegations of torture and ill treatment must be promptly, impartially and effectively investigated by an independent competent authority, that ensures, in particular, that her family has access to justice and truth,” Al-Nashif said in a statement Tuesday. ""The authorities must stop targeting, harassing, and detaining women who do not abide by the hijab rules.""

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Amini “should be alive today.”

“Instead, the United States and the Iranian people mourn her. We call on the Iranian government to end its systemic persecution of women and to allow peaceful protest,” he said on Twitter.

Blinken's remarks came as the U.S. seeks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

Leaders of the European Union also issued a statement, saying Amini's death was ""unacceptable and the perpetrators of this killing must be held accountable.""

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian rejected the criticism and said on Twitter that Amini's death is being investigated by the judiciary and a parliamentary committees. Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi, who departed for New York on Monday to address the U.N. General Assembly, said he had told Amini’s family in a phone call that he has ordered an investigation and vowed to pursue the case.

“To Iran, human rights are of inherent value – unlike those who see it (as) a tool against adversaries,"" he said.

Police in Iran have expanded patrols in recent months and verbally and physically harassed women perceived to be wearing ""loose hijab,"" according to the statement from the United Nations.

The U.N. Human Rights Office said it has received numerous verified videos of women being slapped across the face, beaten with batons and thrown into police vans for not properly wearing the hijab. The office said there are reports Amini was hit on the head with a baton and her head was struck against a vehicle during her arrest.

Mehdi Forozesh, director of Iran’s Forensic Medical Organization, said on state television Saturday that the results of Amini's autopsy would be publicized after further review by medical experts, CNN reported.

The meeting's agenda includes talks regarding the decisions adopted at the NATO Summit in Madrid and the prospect of the preparation for the future high level meeting, a National Defence Ministry (MApN) release mentioned on Wednesday.

The meeting is divided in three working session and it will start with an informal dinner of NATO Defence Ministers, with the attendance of Defence Ministers of Sweden, Finland and Ukraine.

The three working sessions, at the level of defence ministers, will be carried out Thursday and they will tackle aspects of interest for the allies such as: the nuclear deterrence posture of the Alliance and relevant aspects to the nuclear area in the current security context, collective efforts to the long-term adaptation of the deterrence and defence posture, through the lens of the aggression war raged by the Federation Russia in Ukraine, as well as the stage of NATO operations and missions in Kosovo and Iraq.

The last working session will focus on the issues of operations and missions, with the participation of the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, who will provide information regarding the ongoing missions at the European Union level.

Defence Minister Dincu will attend on Wednesday the discussions within the Framework Nations Concept - FNC, coordinated by Germany.

On the sidelines of the NATO defence ministers' meeting, Dincu will participate, on Wednesday, in the meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, and Thursday, he is to attend the meeting of the defence ministers in the Bucharest 9 Format (B9), the quoted source mentions."
1067199357,20221012,"As part of its ongoing emergency special session on Ukraine, the General Assembly met today to consider a draft resolution introduced by Ukraine that, if approved, would condemn the Russian Federation’s annexation of several territories in eastern Ukraine in late September. Many delegates today deplored the annexation as a violation of international law while criticizing the Security Council’s inability to uphold global peace and security.

[Today’s special session was mandated after the Council on 30 September failed to adopt a resolution intended to condemn the Russian Federation referenda that preceded Moscow’s proclamation of its annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. (See Press Release SC/15046 for details.) The draft Council resolution also would have declared that the referenda taken on 23 to 27 September in parts of those regions are neither valid nor form the basis for any alternation of the status of these regions of Ukraine, including any purported annexation by the Russian Federation.]

Introducing the text titled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine: defending the principles of the Charter of the United Nations”, that country’s representative said that, since 23 September, the Russian Federation has again violated international law and the sham referenda in four Ukrainian areas pose an existential threat to the United Nations and its Charter. He urged the Assembly to defend the Charter principles and reconfirm they remain a strong shield to protect all nations. “We are now at a tipping point where the UN will either restore its credibility or ultimately fall in failure,” he said.

The Russian Federation’s representative, however, said Ukraine and the West are pretending that history only began in February. Those who follow discussions in the Security Council know that his delegation had been ready to consider a balanced and fair text in that forum. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) only wants to escalate the conflict as part of its plan to undermine the Russian Federation, he said, stressing that Western Powers continue to supply the regime in Kyiv with deadly weapons, and Ukraine is now a platform to test them. Kyiv and its Western backers have covered up many crimes and those who scream about the Charter being violated did not remember that document when it came to the people of Kosovo and Iraq, he emphasized. He demanded that the Assembly suspend Rule 87 of its Rules of Procedure in order to take a decision on the draft resolution introduced by secret ballot — a motion that was rejected.

Before the Russian Federation delegate took the floor, the Assembly approved a motion put forth by Albania’s delegate for the Assembly’s decision to be taken by a recorded vote. She said the Russian Federation’s efforts to hold a secret ballot is a threat to transparency, pointing out that there is no Assembly precedent to hold a secret ballot on a non-venue issue.

Speaking on behalf of the Nordic and Baltic countries, the representative of Latvia said there is no such thing as a legitimate referendum amid human rights abuses and systematic violations of international humanitarian law, nor is there any such thing as a legal annexation of a State’s territory by another State after threats or direct use of force. The Russian Federation’s sham referenda and illegal attempt to annex any part of Ukrainian territory must be firmly and collectively rejected, he said, calling on the Russian Federation to completely and unilaterally withdraw its troops, comply with the 16 March order by the International Criminal Court and end its aggression against Ukraine.

The representative of Fiji, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said: “The Charter cannot simply be worn like a prestigious cloak only to be discarded when perceived geopolitical interests are at stake.” He strongly condemned the Russian Federation’s latest threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine “and possibly others”. As a permanent member of the Council, the Russian Federation has an even greater responsibility to uphold the United Nations Charter, he said calling for that country to cease its attempted illegal annexations of Ukrainian territory, de-escalate the current situation and withdraw to its internationally recognized borders.

Likewise, the speaker for Poland said the Charter desperately needs the international community’s defence and condemned sham referenda which cannot lead to any binding action. He urged Member States to reject the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation attempt and vote to uphold the international legal order.

Several delegates condemned the Russian Federation’s latest attacks on Kyiv and other cities. The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said the indiscriminate attacks on civilians are war crimes and perpetrators will be held accountable. In the past week, the bloc facilitated a resolution condemning the Russian Federation’s organization of illegal referenda and its subsequent attempt to illegally annex Ukraine’s territory. He urged all Member States to co-sponsor and vote in favour of the text. “If we do not condemn the actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine today, then we condone similar blatant attacks on any and all of our countries tomorrow,” he warned.

Noting that he woke up this morning to the shocking news of the Russian Federation’s attacks, the representative of Türkiye said the war must cease. This Assembly session is being held because the Council failed its primary responsibility. The Russian Federation’s attempts to annex Ukrainian territory are illegal and only serve to jeopardize prospect for peace. Türkiye has sponsored a draft resolution that will be put forward this week, he said, calling for negotiations to end the hostilities.

The speaker for Costa Rica condemned the shelling that ravaged Ukrainian communities over the weekend and said the international community must fear power with impunity and vanquish it with bravery. Noting that today’s meeting is taking place in the Assembly Hall and not the Trusteeship Council, she reminded delegates that States can no longer take the territory of others and expressed solidarity with the people from Ukraine and the Russian Federation who do not benefit from this neo-imperial transgression. States should not recognize annexations and must demand their end, she said, supporting law over force and a peaceful, negotiated solution.

Also speaking today were representatives of Singapore, Indonesia, Malta, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Dominican Republic, Albania, Austria, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Mexico.

At the beginning of the meeting, the Assembly decided by consensus that the Credentials Committee of the seventy-seventh session should serve for the resumed eleventh emergency special session. It also decided to follow the provisions of resolution 77/2 of 7 October, by which the Comoros, Sao Tome and Principe and Somalia are permitted to vote in the Assembly until the end of its seventy-seventh session, and vote at the eleventh emergency special session.

The Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 11 October, to consider the election of Human Rights Council members.

The representative of proposed that the Assembly follow Rule 87 B of its Rules of Procedure and asked that a recorded vote be used when considering draft resolution “Territorial integrity of Ukraine: defending the principles of the Charter of the United Nations” (document A/ES-11/L.5). She said she proposed the motion because the Russian Federation has circulated a proposal that the action be taken through a secret ballot. The Assembly should clarify the issue to avoid confusion. She said the effort of the Russian Federation is a threat to transparency, pointing out that there is no Assembly precedent to hold a secret ballot on a non-venue issue.

The Assembly then approved by a vote of 107 in favour to 13 against, with 39 abstentions, the Albanian representative’s motion ‑ that the pending decision on Assembly resolution A/ES-11/L.5 be taken by a recorded vote.

CSABA KŐRÖSI (Hungary), President of the General Assembly, said that even though the war in Ukraine should have never started, it will end one day. “Guns will be silent, but when? At what cost?” he asked. In spotlighting skyrocketing food prices and the threat of famine, he called for the Black Sea Grain Initiative’s renewal beyond November. Turning to the constant fear of nuclear disaster, he commended the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for ensuring the safety of nuclear plants in the warzone. Any threat of using nuclear weapons should be universally condemned, he said. The United Nations Charter, Assembly and Secretary‑General have all been clear: aggression is illegal. Annexing territories by force is also illegal, he added while echoing the Secretary‑General that the referenda in occupied regions cannot be a genuine expression of popular will. “When it [be]comes a daily routine to watch images of destroyed cities and scattered bodies, we lose our humanity,” he stressed. The fighting must stop; the Russian Federation must withdraw its troops from Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders in line with the Assembly’s resolution on 2 March 2022. The alternative is a world without shared rules, without peace, without a future, he warned.

SERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( ), introducing “L.5”, said his day began 14 hours ago when his country was under attack and his family was unable to go to a bomb shelter. The Russian Federation is trying to bring the world back to the 1930s, when Adolf Hitler destroyed sovereign nations by invasion, fake referenda and Anschluss, he added. “We are now at a tipping point where the UN will either restore its credibility or ultimately fall in failure,” he said, as it is the Assembly’s responsibility to defend the principles of the Charter. Since 23 September, the Russian Federation has carried out another crime against international law. The sham referenda in four Ukrainian regions, followed by unlawful decisions by the Russian President and Parliament, served this very purpose and pose an existential threat to the United Nations and its Charter, he said.

Recalling the Organization’s first purpose enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter ‑ to maintain international peace and security and, to that end, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace and for the suppression of acts of aggression, he said Paragraph 4 of Article 2 is the most important in the regard, particularly concerning the threat and use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Violation of Paragraph 4 violates the cornerstone of peace in the Charter and basic rules of contemporary international law. “The only thing that Russia is afraid of is our strong unity of purpose in the UN Charter, in defence of the right of every country to benefit from respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said, adding: “We have to save the United Nations. Not for the sake of this Hall, high-level weeks and other procedural and protocol issues that have been our routine since 1945. We need to do it for the sake of ourselves as most of us will find ourselves extremely vulnerable and unprotected if the Russian vision of the future prevails.” He urged the Assembly to reconfirm the Charter’s principles remain a strong shield to protect all nations. The spirit that guided the Assembly’s predecessors in San Francisco 77 years ago to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war should guide the Assembly now when it considers the draft resolution, he said.

VASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( ) began his speech with procedural issues, telling the hall that they had just witnessed “an outrageous fraud” when the General Assembly President took part in depriving his delegation from taking the floor on a point of order. “This is an unprecedented manipulation,” he added. Ukraine and the West are pretending that history only began in February 2022. Those who follow discussions in the Security Council know that the Russian Federation stood ready for a balanced and fair text and one that pushes for diplomacy. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) only wants to escalate the conflict which has long been part of its plan to undermine the Russian Federation, he said. Ukraine was chosen by those countries for this very purpose and is today a platform to test weapons.

The Russian Federation is trying to “protect our brothers and sisters in Eastern Ukraine”, he continued. Those are the same people that the Ukrainian Government calls “subhuman”. Kyiv and its Western backers have covered up many crimes. Those who scream about the United Nations Charter being violated did not remember that document when it came to the people of Kosovo and Iraq. The regime in Kyiv continues to be supplied deadly weapons by Western powers. These weapons target civilians, who are being “executed and thrown into pits”. In the east and the south of Ukraine, peaceful people are dying. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s appeal for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the Russian Federation threatens global peace, he said, adding that the principle of territorial integrity applies to those that represent the entire people living under that Government. The Kyiv regime is devoid of this privilege because it impedes and violates the rights of the Russian-speaking people, but that is not in line with the unilateral speaking points of the West. He demanded that the Assembly suspend Rule 87 of its Rules of Procedure in order to take a decision on draft resolution A/ES-11/L.5 by secret ballot.

Mr. KŐRÖSI said this would constitute a reconsideration of Assembly’s earlier decision to adopt the motion submitted by Albania and recalled Rule 81.

The representatives of and took the floor to oppose the motion by the Russian Federation.

The representative of the disagreed with the President’s ruling saying that Rule 81 does not apply as there are two different proposals. As the Russian Federation is proposing that Rule 87 B be suspended as a whole, Article 71 applies to his delegation’s proposal, he clarified.

Mr. KŐRÖSI said Rule 81 is applicable as the Russian Federation has challenged the President’s ruling that the proposal is a reconsideration of the earlier decision. The Assembly rejected the appeal against the President’s ruling by a vote of 100 against to 14 in favour with 38 in abstention. The Assembly upheld the President’s ruling.

The Assembly then rejected a reconsideration of its earlier decision by a vote of 104 against to 16 in favour, with 34 in abstention.

The representative of the then took the floor on a point of order and called for a vote on the draft resolution.

Mr. KŐRÖSI reiterated that he would conduct the meeting in accordance with the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure and past practices including of emergency special sessions. The Assembly therefore would proceed with the debate and then take action on the resolution.

The representative of the , taking the floor on a point of order, asked for previous instances where the decisions on the Rules of Procedure, including voting, were taken at the beginning of the debate with voting then occurring at the end. Disagreeing with the “illogical and inconsistent” approach, he referenced the Assembly’s long wait before voting and expressed his regret over how the proceedings were conducted.

ANDREJS PILDEGOVIČS ( ), speaking on behalf of the Nordic and Baltic Countries, said there is no such thing as a legitimate referendum amidst brutal warfare and widespread and systematic violations of international humanitarian law, human rights violations and abuses. There is no such thing as a valid annexation of a State’s territory by another State after threats or direct use of force. Under international law, all States are obliged to not recognize the attempted illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory by the Russian Federation. He said a world without respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and the rules-based international order cannot stand. Therefore, the sham referenda and illegal attempt to annex any part of Ukrainian territory by the Russian Federation must be firmly and collectively rejected, he said, adding that the Russian Federation must completely and unilaterally withdraw its troops from that territory within its internationally recognized borders. The Russian Federation must comply with the 16 March order of the International Criminal Court, which is binding on the parties, and stop its aggression against Ukraine. The Assembly must underline that the unacceptable threats of the Russian Federation on the use of nuclear weapons is in clear violation of the Charter, he stressed.

SATYENDRA PRASAD ( ), speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said: “The Charter cannot simply be worn like a prestigious cloak only to be discarded when perceived geopolitical interests are at stake.” He strongly condemned the latest threats of the Russian Federation to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine “and possibly others” and emphasized that as a permanent member of the Security Council, the Russian Federation has an even greater responsibility to uphold the Charter of the United Nations. The Pacific Islands Forum thus calls for that country to cease its attempted illegal annexations of Ukrainian territory, to de-escalate the current situation and to withdraw to its internationally recognized borders, he said.

Speaking in his national capacity, he urged the Secretary‑General to use all available tools through his good offices to end the war. For its part, the Security Council must work to restore trust in the Charter and faith in the promise of the United Nations. Emphasizing the conflict’s impact on the entire world, especially in the Global South, at a time of manifold challenges, including climate change and a potential full-blown economic crisis, he said: “The war on Ukraine must end to give the world a fighting chance.”

SILVIO GONZATO, representative of the , in its capacity as observer, condemned today’s attacks on Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Such indiscriminate attacks on civilians are war crimes and perpetrators will be held to account, he said. In the past week, the European Union facilitated a resolution condemning the Russian Federation’s organization of illegal referenda and its subsequent attempt to illegally annex Ukraine’s territory. He urged all Member States to co-sponsor and vote in favour of the text. “If we do not condemn the actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine today, then we condone similar blatant attacks on any and all of our countries tomorrow,” he warned. He then rejected and condemned the illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions and called on all States and international organizations to do so as well.

FERIDUN HADI SINIRLIOĞLU ( ) said the war must cease. The Assembly session is being held because the Security Council failed its primary responsibility. He said he woke up to the shocking news this morning of the attacks by the Russian Federation. He supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity and rejected the alleged referenda, calling the attempts to annex Ukrainian territory illegal and a grave violation of international law. The annexation only serves to jeopardize the prospects for peace. The Russian Federation should reverse its decision and return to diplomacy, he stressed, adding that conflicts should be resolved through peaceful means. Turkiye has sponsored a draft resolution that will be put forward this week, he said. Stressing that Turkiye did not want war in the region, he called for negotiations to end the hostilities.

BURHAN GAFOOR ( ) expressed disappointment and concern that the war in Ukraine has escalated with mounting casualties. The recent decision by the Russian Federation to organized referenda and annex four regions within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders is not only a further escalation but also a clear violation of international law and the Charter, he said. Sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity must be respected. For small States, these are not matters of academic debate but rather of life and death, he emphasized while adding that a system based on the idea that might is right is unacceptable. As a co-sponsor of the draft resolution, he urged Member States to send a clear signal that international law must be upheld by voting in support.

MARITZA CHAN VALVERDE ( ), in noting that the meeting is occurring in the Assembly Hall and not in the Trusteeship Council, reminded all that States can no longer take the territory of others. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Crimea are all Ukraine, she stressed while condemning the shelling that ravaged Ukrainian communities over the weekend. The international community must fear power with impunity and vanquish it with bravery, she urged. Costa Rica stands in solidarity with the people from Ukraine and the Russian Federation who do not benefit from this neo-imperial transgression, she said. In spotlighting human rights violations, she called for all parties to comply with international law. The Russian Federation, she continued, must end its nuclear blackmail and abide by its obligations. States should not recognize annexations and must demand their end, the prevalence of law over force, the absence of impunity and a peaceful and negotiated solution, she emphasized.

KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI ( ) said the United Nations Charter desperately needs the international community’s defence and condemned sham referendums which cannot lead to any binding action. The upcoming vote on the draft resolution should be a strong and resounding yes. Not condemning the attempted annexation of Ukrainian territory undermines the international legal order, he said, and called on all Member States to speak out in defence of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and of its sovereign independence. He urged Member States to reject the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation attempt and vote yes for upholding the international legal order.

ARRMANATHA CHRISTIAWAN NASIR ( ) said it is “crystal clear” that the dispute between nations could only be solved through diplomacy. War only leads to death and destruction. The events of the last few hours and days underscore this. He reiterated his Government’s calls to end the war. The international community must work harder to ensure peace prevails, he said, stressing peace must be the ultimate priority. Innocent people caught in the crossfire are victims to war. But also, billions of people, particularly the world’s poor, have become unintended victims of this war, as the price of food and energy has skyrocketed in recent months. He urged the General Assembly to avoid a “take it or leave it” approach and expressed regret that calls for a peaceful resolution failed to be included in today’s draft resolution. Peaceful resolutions cannot be held back by divisions, he stressed.

VANESSA FRAZIER ( ), aligning herself with the European Union, fully supported the resumption of the Assembly’s emergency session and condemned the most recent attack against Kyiv and other cities. These are attacks against civilians and are war crimes, she said. As a member of the veto initiative, she firmly believed the Assembly has a duty to react to violations of international law. She condemned attempts by the Russian Federation to annex the areas through sham referenda, which are a blatant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and show a complete disregard for international law. Stressing that the Security Council is responsible for international peace and security, she said the use of the veto in this situation is reprehensible and the rest of the United Nations membership must strongly reject this use.

YOKA BRANDT ( ), aligning herself with the European Union, said her country would never recognize the sham referenda and illegal attempts to annex Ukrainian territory. The Netherlands continues to stand firmly with Ukraine and will continue to provide support for as long as it takes, she added. Calling upon Member States to hold the Russian Federation to account and make clear that might is not right, she reminded all that the veto does not provide a blank check. “Our international rule book is no longer just in jeopardy. It has been trampled by a permanent member of the Security Council,” she emphasized. Those responsible for violating the Charter and committing atrocities must be held to account. As the Hague is the legal capital of the world, the Netherlands has a special responsibility and will not waver in its efforts to achieve justice for those who suffer from sexual violence, deportation, torture and random killing, she stressed. She condemned today’s attacks, renewed her country’s call on the Russian Federation to suspend its military operations and called on Member States to vote in favour.

ANNE FRANÇOISE DOSTERT ( ), associating herself with the statement made by the European Union, condemned the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and its deadly missile attacks launched today against Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Today’s meeting allows all Member States to speak on a subject of concern to everyone. Faced with Security Council’s paralysis, the General Assembly now has the responsibility to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter. In these difficult times, Member States must particularly stress the principle that all countries should refrain from threatening the political independence and territorial sovereignty of any other state, she said. Any attempt at annexation of territory violates the Charter, has no legal value, and must be condemned. Today’s draft text is precise, she said, urging all Member States to vote for it. What is happening in Ukraine today, can happen to other nations tomorrow if the principles of the United Nations are not upheld, she warned.

JOSÉ ALFONSO BLANCO CONDE ( ) reaffirmed his delegation’s commitment to the international order. He said it is gravely concerning to see the principles of the Charter repeatedly violated. Recent events indicate that the conflict threatens to expand as the spaces for dialogue and a peaceful solution narrow. The move of the Russian Federation to decree the annexation of the Ukrainian territory is disturbing. The discussion of this issue is painful as it is a situation that violates the human rights of people in the area of conflict while placing the entire world on the brink of disaster, he said. It is difficult to endure these human rights violations and the fact that the Council cannot act, he said, pointing to the abuse of the veto in the Council. There is no other alternative but to appeal to the parties involved to exercise good sense, he concluded.

ALBANA DAUTLLARI ( ) said the referenda organized in a rush and at gunpoint demonstrated that there is no international law, United Nations Charter nor Constitution of Ukraine for the Russian Federation. Albania does not recognize the sham referenda and stands in full support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognizing borders. Describing the attempts of the Russian Federation to compare the independence of Kosovo with the illegal annexation of Ukraine as “wrong” and “cynical”, she said “no attempt to compare the incomparable nor shortcut out of any historical and political context will help Russia divert attention from its war of choice in Ukraine or hide its blatant breach of international law.” In recalling the veto of the Russian Federation of the Security Council text tabled by Albania and the United States, she noted that the Russian Federation cannot veto the Assembly. By voting in favour, Member States are voting for rules, order, justice, core principles, peace and security, she emphasized.

JOCHEN HANS-JOACHIM ALMOSLECHNER ( ), associating himself with the European Union, said that Member States have a duty to call for an end to the illegal acts of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. That is particularly important for neutral countries such as Austria which depend on respect for international law, treaties and customs for their security. The Security Council’s failure to act must be discussed and the Secretary‑General’s “New Agenda for Peace” is an opportunity to do so, he said. In the meantime, the Assembly must send a strong signal that the world does not accept this blatant breach of the Charter. He went on to say that “this senseless Russian aggression has plunged the whole world into peril” and that the threat of nuclear weapons is an unacceptable violation of Charter principles.

CHRISTIAN WENAWESER ( ) said the aggression of the Russian Federation goes hand in hand with its attempt to deface the fundamental concepts of international law. But the law is clear, and it is the international community’s collective duty to uphold it, he added. The attempt of the Russian Federation to forcibly annex Ukrainian territory is just its latest crime of aggression. Russian leadership must be held to account. The Russian Federation makes a mockery of the right to self-determination and its attempt to fabricate election results through blackmail and intimidation “evokes the worst memories of colonial oppression and imperialism”. These acts are not new but just the latest from a playbook that the Russian Federation has used in Syria and Chechnya as well, he added.

PASCALE CHRISTINE BAERISWYL ( ), emphasizing the importance of a rules-based international order, said: “We cannot tolerate that the power of the strongest prevails over the rights of the weakest.” The Russian Federation must de-escalate and withdraw its forces from Ukrainian territory, whose annexation violates Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, she added. She called on the Russian Federation to immediately stop indiscriminate attacks on residential areas in Ukraine, reiterated Switzerland’s call for strict respect of international humanitarian law and human rights and appealed for swift and unhindered humanitarian access throughout Ukraine and in areas occupied by the Russian Federation. In line with its humanitarian tradition, Switzerland reiterates its offer of good offices, she added.

BARBARA WOODWARD ( ) said over seven months into the war, the whole world understands the terrible cost of the Russian Federation’s invasion. Even today, millions across Ukraine awoke to the sound of air raid sirens as the Russian Federation carried out one of the largest bombardments of civilian areas and infrastructure of the war, she said. As a result of the invasion, everyone’s lives around the world have been made more difficult and insecure. At Headquarters in New York, the cost is seen in terms of damage to the United Nations Charter. To the principle that no threat or use of force shall be made against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. If any rouge Head of State can, by force or fiat, change the borders of another Member State, then there can be no way to resolve disputes or to achieve the fundamental goals of the United Nations. She reiterated the United Kingdom’s call for the Russian Federation to end the war and to honour the Charter, and urged delegations to vote in favour of the draft resolution.

JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ ( ) said his delegation will vote in favour of today’s draft text, a position grounded in support for stringent compliance with United Nations principles. Mexico has been a victim of invasions and cannot allow other countries to fall victim to such acts of aggression. There is no place for false dichotomies, he said, adding that one principle cannot be upheld while another violated. For example, the right to self-determination cannot violate the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The so-called referenda held by the Russian Federation lack all legal standing. Given that a referendum was held during an armed conflict, any expression of popular will is null and void. It is not possible through a veto to eliminate or discredit international norms and legal institutions, he added, encouraging Member States to consider suspending the use of the veto in incidents of mass atrocities."

• Polish pipeline operator PERN said Wednesday that a leak detected on one of its Druzhba pipelines bringing oil from Russia to Europe was likely caused by an accident.
• Mateusz Berger, Poland's top official in charge of energy infrastructure, told Reuters via telephone that there were no grounds to believe the leak was caused by sabotage.
• The Druzhba pipeline leak comes just over two weeks after a series of blasts on two subsea gas pipelines connecting Russia to Germany triggered what might be the single largest release of methane in history.

Polish pipeline operator PERN said Wednesday that a leak detected on one of its Druzhba pipelines bringing oil from Russia to Europe was likely caused by an accident.

The leak was detected on Tuesday evening on one of the two lines of the Western section of the pipeline, PERN said in a statement. The incident occurred roughly 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) from the central Polish city of Plock.

PERN said pumping on the damaged line, which delivers oil to Germany, was immediately switched off and the scene had been secured. Pumping through the other line continued as normal, the company said.

The cause of the incident is not yet known, but the Polish government said the damage caused was probably accidental.

Mateusz Berger, Poland's top official in charge of energy infrastructure, told Reuters via telephone that there were no grounds to believe the leak was caused by sabotage. ""Here we can talk about accidental damage,"" Berger said.

The Druzhba pipeline, which translates as ""friendship"" in Russia, is one of the biggest oil pipeline networks in the world, delivering crude from Russia to much of central and eastern Europe including Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Belarus, Poland and Slovakia.

It comes just over two weeks after a series of blasts on two subsea gas pipelines connecting Russia to Germany triggered what might be the single largest release of methane in history.

An initial crime scene investigation led by Sweden's national security service said the gas leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines reinforced suspicions of ""gross sabotage.""

Many in Europe suspect the Nord Stream gas leaks were the result of a deliberate attack, particularly as the blasts came amid a bitter energy standoff between the European Union and Russia.

The Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed claims it destroyed the pipelines, calling such allegations ""stupid"" and ""absurd,"" and claiming that it is the U.S. that had the most to gain from the gas leaks.

The White House has denied any involvement in the suspected attack.

1067201018,20221012,"Warren Buffett likes dividend stocks. And he owns positions in more of them than you might think, because he has what you might call a ""secret portfolio.""

As the largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.89%) (BRK.B -1.24%), Buffett has exposure to every stock that the giant conglomerate owns. Its equity holdings aren't limited to those that it discloses on 13-F filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, though. Berkshire Hathaway also fully owns New England Asset Management -- and it, too, has a portfolio that includes dozens of stocks.

NEAM holds positions in quite a few dividend stocks that are among Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, but it also owns some that aren't. Here are three dividend stocks in Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" that are the most likely to soar in Q4.

Chevron (CVX 0.30%) ranked as the fourth-largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio at the end of Q2. However, the oil and natural gas giant is also one of the largest holdings for NEAM. As a result, Chevron is actually Buffett's third-largest stock holding.

It has been a big winner for the legendary investor in 2022, vaulting upward by more than 30% year to date. I think the stock is likely to move even higher in Q4.

The recent decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production should lead to higher oil prices. In addition, the European Union plans to ban 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of this year. These two actions will probably serve as catalysts for Chevron stock.

Regardless of what happens with its share price, Chevron will continue rewarding investors with dividends. With a more than 25-year streak of annual payout hikes, it's a member of the exclusive group known as Dividend Aristocrats, and at the current share price offers a dividend yield of nearly 3.6%.

Berkshire Hathaway doesn't own any shares of ExxonMobil (XOM 0.44%). However, NEAM has a small position in the huge oil and natural gas company.

ExxonMobil has delivered an even more impressive year-to-date gain than Chevron has. Its shares are up more than 60%.

The same factors that seem likely to propel Chevron higher in Q4 should also work in ExxonMobil's favor. Higher natural gas prices could continue to boost the energy stock as well.

It's possible that ExxonMobil could continue to outperform Chevron. The stock is still attractively valued with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.4 compared to Chevron's forward earnings multiple of 10.1.

Meanwhile, ExxonMobil's dividend yields nearly 3.5% at today's share prices. Like Chevron, the company is a Dividend Aristocrat. ExxonMobil has increased its dividend annually for 39 consecutive years, a little longer than Chevron's steak of 35 years.

Merck (MRK -0.69%) held a spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in the past, but it doesn't now. However, the conglomerate still has a stake in the drugmaker thanks to NEAM's 95,642 shares.

The investing guru might actually wish Berkshire Hathaway hadn't sold its Merck stake in 2021. The big pharma stock has jumped nearly 20% higher year to date in 2022.

Blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda and COVID-19 antiviral therapy Lagevrio are driving most of Merck's growth. However, a new product could help light a fire under the stock in Q4 and beyond. Merck recently announced positive results from a late-stage study of sotatercept in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension. The company now plans to move quickly to file for regulatory approvals of the drug.

The resilience of Merck's business during economic downturns should continue to attract investors looking for safe havens. So could its dividend, which yields nearly 3.2%."

1067203100,20221012,"The representative of RSF asked the Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister and Government Spokesperson, Ioannis Oikonomou, at their meeting on 10 October to open a dialogue on a comprehensive reform of the legal safeguards against arbitrary surveillance of journalists. He demanded that the minister discuss with the journalistic community RSF’s detailed recommendations aiming to remedy the lack of judicial oversight in cases of surveillance on national security grounds, the lack of guarantees against the abuse of surveillance, especially against the wiretapping of journalists, and the lack of a clear definition of “national security”.

The arbitrary spying on Thanasis Koukakis, covering financial affairs, and Stavros Malichudis working on migration issues, by the National Intelligence Service (EYP) was made possible by the current legal framework. Its insufficiencies are further aggravated by the absence of specific safeguards against the illegitimate use of spyware.

Replying to Pavol Szalai’s request to legislate on spywares, Ioannis Oikonomou promised at the meeting that the government “will soon propose a law to make the use of spyware illegal”, while repeating that the Greek authorities did not procure or use Predator. The spyware infected the phone and illegally breached the privacy of Thanasis Koukakis in addition to his surveillance by the EYP. According to the revelations of the Greek media, a company owned by the Prime Minister’s Secretary General - who has resigned since - had dealings with the firm selling Predator. But the ongoing criminal investigation and parliamentary inquiry into the surveillance has so far failed to shed more light on the attempt on press freedom.

The Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister pledged to RSF that the government will continue its “ongoing initiatives” to establish additional checks on the operation of secret services. RSF believes that the most important step in this regard is repealing - with retroactive effect - the amendment preventing individuals from being informed under certain conditions about their past surveillance. Such change to the legislation would allow journalists to exercise their right to effective remedy.

The amendment with retroactive effect, whose repealing RSF requests, was passed in March 2021. It prohibited the Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) to inform Thanasis Koukakis if he was under surveillance by the state. Although the government denies the journalist’s claim to ADAE was the reason for the amendment, it was voted shortly after Thanasis Koukakis seized the Authority. Trustworthy information about the wiretapping of both journalists later leaked to the press.

On his mission to Greece, Pavol Szalai also discussed RSF’s recommendations with the ADAE President and former Council of State judge, Christos Rammos. “As I have already written together with my colleagues in an article 1, the amendment 2 - according to which the ADAE is absolutely prohibited from notifying the targeted persons the legal interception of their communications for national security reasons in the past - is contradictory to the relevant case-law of the European Court of Human Rights”, the Authority’s President said at the meeting with RSF on 11 October. He added that he is “in favor of improving the legal framework regulating the legal interception in Greece in order to guarantee better checks and balances in the whole procedure, and to achieve a more effective protection of the right to private life of the citizens enshrined in the constitution”.

The gap between the constitutional guarantee and the perception of its effectiveness by the journalists in Greece can be hardly bigger in a democracy. Journalists’ fear of mass surveillance and mistrust towards the authorities in charge of their protection has been demonstrated by a September open letter asking the European Parliament to check their phones for spyware.

If the Greek authorities want to win back the trust of the journalists, they not only have to protect the media professionals against arbitrary surveillance and investigate its use, but also bring justice for the assassination of the crime reporter Giorgos Karaivaz on 9 April 2021. Speaking at the journalistic conference “A Matter of Trust” organized in Athens by iMEdD, Pavol Szalai expressed RSF’s dismay that 18 months since his murder, no one was arrested for the crime and the investigation appeared blocked. After meeting the journalist’s wife and son, RSF’s representative asked the Deputy Prime Minister to invite Europol to help the Greek police with the probe. The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation has been helpful in the successful investigation of the killing of the journalist Jan Kuciak in Slovakia. In this country, in Malta and the Netherlands, suspects had already been detained or judged one year into the murder, leaving the lack of progress in Greece unmatched in the EU in the recent period.

Greece, the only EU country concentrating in a short time span assassination of a journalist, arbitrary surveillance of reporters as well as other threats to their physical security and independence, is ranked in RSF’s 2022 World Press Freedom Index last in the EU, on 108th place out of 180."
1067210920,20221012,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — A new liquefied natural gas project off Africa's western coast may only be 80% complete, but already the prospect of a new energy supplier has drawn visits from the leaders of Poland and Germany.

The initial field near Senegal and Mauritania’s coastlines is expected to contain about 15 trillion cubic feet (425 billion cubic meters) of gas, five times more than what gas-dependent Germany used in all of 2019. But production isn't expected to start until the end of next year.

That won't help solve Europe's energy crisis triggered by Russia's war in Ukraine. Still, Gordon Birrell, an executive for project co-developer BP, says the development “could not be more timely"" as Europe seeks to reduce its reliance on Russian natural gas to power factories, generate electricity and heat homes.

“Current world events are demonstrating the vital role that (liquid gas) can play in underpinning the energy security of nations and regions,” he told an energy industry meeting in West Africa last month.

While Africa’s natural gas reserves are vast and North African countries like Algeria have pipelines already linked to Europe, a lack of infrastructure and security challenges have long stymied producers in other parts of the continent from scaling up exports. Established African producers are cutting deals or reducing energy use so they have more to sell to boost their finances, but some leaders warn that hundreds of millions of Africans lack electricity and supplies are needed at home.

Nigeria has Africa’s largest natural gas reserves, said Horatius Egua, a spokesman for the petroleum minister, though it accounts for only 14% of the European Union’s imports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, that comes by ship. Projects face the risk of energy thefts and high costs. Other promising countries like Mozambique have discovered large gas reserves only to see projects delayed by violence from Islamic militants.

Europe has been scrambling to secure alternative sources as Moscow has reduced natural gas flows to EU countries, triggering soaring energy prices and growing expectations of a recession. The 27-nation EU, whose energy ministers are meeting this week to discuss a gas price cap, is bracing for the possibility of a complete Russian cutoff but has still managed to fill gas reserves to 90%.

European leaders have flocked to countries like Norway, Qatar, Azerbaijan and especially those in North Africa, where Algeria has a pipeline running to Italy and another to Spain.

Italy signed a $4 billion gas deal with Algeria in July, a month after Egypt reached an agreement with the European Union and Israel to boost sales of LNG. Angola also has signed a gas deal with Italy.

While an earlier agreement allowed Italy's biggest energy company to start production at two Algerian gas fields this week, it wasn't clear when flows would start from the July deal because it lacked specifics, analysts said.

African leaders like Senegalese President Macky Sall want their countries to cash in on these projects even as they’re dissuaded from pursuing fossil fuels. They don’t want to export it all either — an estimated 600 million Africans lack access to electricity.

“It is legitimate, fair and equitable that Africa, the continent that pollutes the least and lags furthest behind in the industrialization process should exploit its available resources to provide basic energy, improve the competitiveness of its economy and achieve universal access to electricity,” Sall told the U.N. General Assembly last month.

Algeria is a major supplier — it and Egypt accounted for 60% of the natural gas production in Africa in 2020 — but it can't offset Russian gas to Europe at this stage, said Mahfoud Kaoubi, professor of economics and specialist in energy issues at the University of Algiers.

“Russia has an annual production of 270 billion cubic meters — it’s huge,"" Kaoubi said. “Algeria is 120 billion cubic meters, of which 70.50% is intended for consumption on the internal market.""

This year, Algeria is forecast to have piped exports of 31.8 billion cubic meters, according to Tom Purdie, a Europe, Middle East and Africa gas analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“The key concern here surrounds the level of production step-up that can be achieved, and the impact domestic demand could have"" given how much gas Algeria uses at home, Purdie said.

Cash-strapped Egypt also is looking to export more natural gas to Europe, even regulating air conditioning in shopping malls and lights on streets to save energy and sell it instead.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly says Egypt hopes to bring in an additional $450 million a month in foreign currency by rerouting 15% of its domestic gas usage for export, state media reported.

More than 60% of Egypt’s natural gas consumption still is used by power stations to keep the country running. Most of its LNG goes to Asian markets.

A new, three-party deal will see Israel send more gas to Europe via Egypt, which has facilities to liquefy it for export by sea. The EU says it will help the two countries increase gas production and exploration.

In Nigeria, ambitious plans have yet to yield results despite years of planning. The country exported less than 1% of its vast natural gas reserves last year.

A proposed 4,400-kilometer-long (2,734-mile-long) pipeline that would take Nigerian gas to Algeria through Niger has been stalled since 2009, mainly because of its estimated cost of $13 billion.

Many fear that even if completed, the Trans-Sahara Gas Pipeline would face security risks like Nigeria's oil pipelines, which have come under frequent attacks from militants and vandals.

The same challenges would hinder increased gas exports to Europe, said Olufola Wusu, a Lagos-based oil and gas expert.

“If you look at the realities on ground — issues that have to do with crude oil theft — and others begin to question our ability to supply gas to Europe,” he said.

Wusu urged pursuing LNG, calling it the “most profitable"" gas strategy so far.

Even that isn't without issues: In July, the head of Nigeria LNG Limited, the country’s largest natural gas firm, said its plant was producing at just 68% of capacity, mainly because its operations and earnings have been stifled by oil theft.

In the south, Mozambique is slated to become a major exporter of LNG after significant deposits were found along its Indian Ocean coast in 2010. France's TotalEnergies invested $20 billion and started work to extract gas that would be liquefied in a plant it was building in Palma, in the northern Cabo Delgado province.

But Islamic extremist violence forced TotalEnergies to indefinitely scupper the project last year. Mozambican officials have pledged to secure the Palma area to allow work to resume.

Italian firm Eni, meanwhile, pressed ahead with plans to pump and liquefy some of its gas deposits discovered in Mozambique in 2011 and 2014. Eni established a platform in the Indian Ocean 50 miles (80 kilometers) offshore, away from the violence in Cabo Delgado.

It's the first floating LNG facility in the deep waters off Africa, Eni says, with gas liquefaction capacity of 3.4 million tons per year.

The platform liquefied its first gas on Oct. 2, according to Africa Energy, and the first shipment is expected to depart for Europe in mid-October.

1067215625,20221012,"All efforts must be made to find an alternative to fresh Stormont elections, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.

Mr Coveney was in Belfast where he held meetings with Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP.

The DUP is blocking the functioning of the power-sharing institutions in Belfast as part of its protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The protocol was aimed at avoiding a hard border but has created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland, causing resentment and anger among many unionists and loyalists.

The dispute has created an impasse in efforts to form a devolved government at Stormont.

The UK Government has vowed to secure changes to the protocol, either by way of a negotiated compromise with the EU or through proposed domestic legislation that would empower ministers to scrap the arrangements without the approval of Brussels.

Relations between the UK and EU appear to have improved since Liz Truss became prime minister, and London and Brussels have been talking up the potential for a deal through fresh negotiations.

Mr Truss told the House of Commons today that the UK government would proceed with a planned law to override some post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland if a negotiated settlement could not be reached with the European Union.

""We need to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland ... I would prefer to achieve that through a negotiated solution with the EU but if we are not able to do that, we can't allow the situation to drift, we have to proceed with the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill,"" she told the House of Commons.

Current legislation says that unless Stormont is restored by 28 October, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has to call fresh Assembly elections, something he has said he is prepared to do.

Mr Coveney has said that a deal between the UK and EU before 28 October is ""not realistic"".

He added: ""I'm speaking to the Secretary of State on quite a regular basis and we are going to be working together quite intensively over the next few weeks to try to create the conditions to allow all parties in Northern Ireland to believe that they can move back into the space to establish an executive and a functioning Assembly.

""We are looking for a breakthrough on some of these issues in the next few weeks so that we can have the basis for a step forward on some of the contentious issues before the end of October.

""In doing so provide the momentum and encouragement for the one party not willing to re-enter the executive for now, it is worth taking that jump.

""It is time to agree common ground so we can put issues to bed.""

Speaking following her meeting with Mr Coveney, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said: ""I am extremely concerned that we are 16 days away from having absolutely no political leadership, political oversight and scrutiny, decision making or direction setting within government.

""We are potentially entering into that void at a time of unprecedented crisis. Not just for individual families through the cost-of-living crisis, but for businesses and the economy through the cost-of-doing-business crisis.

""We saw yesterday, for the first time, a downturn in employment and the impact that will have on individual people's lives.

""And yet it seems that despite all of that, the DUP are willing to use the pain of the people of Northern Ireland as leverage on the protocol.""

Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill said it was not acceptable that an executive at Stormont has not been formed.

She added: ""There is one party which is blocking that. We need the DUP to join with the rest of us, we need to be around the executive table, we need to be taking decisions in the best interests of people.

""We need to be a strong voice against what is happening in Britain, the fact that mortgage interest rates are going through the roof and affecting pensions.

""It is ridiculous that we don't have a government in place.""

But DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said that any agreement over the protocol must produce an outcome which is acceptable to unionists.

He said: ""Whether Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom is restored by a negotiated outcome or by Parliament legislating is a matter for the Government.

""We hope the negotiations can produce an outcome which is acceptable to unionists, but we are mindful that we tried working devolution for two years and negotiating at the same time only for Brussels to rebuff any progress in that period.

""I note the Prime Minister's commitment today to find an outcome in talks which replicates the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill.

""The government must recognise that the checks are but a symptom that Northern Ireland is subject to a different set of laws imposed upon us by a foreign entity without any say or vote by any elected representative of the people of Northern Ireland.

""We set seven tests last year. That is the yardstick we will use to measure any proposed solution.

""Devolution can have a stable and enduring future, but it must be built on solid foundations.

""Power-sharing without unionist support is doomed to failure.""

Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said after his meeting with Mr Coveney that calling a fresh election would make no sense as ""it won't change anything"".

He said an election would be counterproductive as negotiations between the UK and EU to try to resolve the Northern Ireland Protocol dispute would be paused during an election campaign.

""It would be really unhelpful and will harden positions and drive the parties back into the trenches,"" he said."

Yemeni official sources stated that Alimi met in Riyadh with the assistant Secretary-General of the European Union, Enrique Mora, and the EU deputy Director of the Middle East and North Africa Department, Carl Hallergard.

According to Saba news agency, the meeting reviewed recent developments in Yemen, the ongoing efforts to renew the humanitarian truce, and the needed European pressure to push the Iranian-backed Houthis to positively engage in the peace process.

The two sides also discussed the role of the EU in supporting the reforms led by the Presidential Leadership Council and the government to improve services and alleviate the human suffering of the Yemeni people.

On Monday, Alimi met with Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, who emphasized the support of the Saudi-led coalition to the Council, and all efforts deployed to achieve security, peace and stability in the country.

Yemeni and Saudi official sources said that the meeting touched on the efforts of the United Nations to extend the truce and alleviate human suffering, as well as the future steps required to deal with potential changes.

Saudi support for the Council and Yemeni demands for the Europeans to put more pressure on the Houthis come as the pro-Iran group continues to reject the UN plan proposed by envoy Hans Grundberg to extend the truce.

In related news, Yemeni Foreign Minister Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak met on Monday in Riyadh with US Ambassador Steven Fagin, to discuss “recent developments and the repercussions of the Houthi militia’s obstruction to the efforts to extend the UN truce.”

The Yemeni foreign minister described the terrorist threats launched by the Houthi militias to target oil companies and civilian oil facilities, as “a dangerous escalation, the effects of which will not only damage the Yemeni infrastructure and economy… but will expand to reach the region and international energy supplies.”

“Such terrorist threats and actions call for a firm and resolute stance from the international community,” he underlined."
1067220912,20221012,"The Polish company, Berne, said today, Wednesday, that it had detected a leak in one of the Druzhba pipelines that transports oil from Russia to Europe, at a time when the old continent is facing a severe energy crisis with the continuation of the Russian war on Ukraine.

The company responsible for operating the pipes said - in a statement - that it had discovered on Tuesday evening a leak in a part of the pipe 70 kilometers from the city of Blok in central Poland, according to the British Guardian newspaper.

She explained that the reasons for the leak are currently unknown, and this company said that the second line of pipelines, in addition to other elements of the company's infrastructure, are operating as usual.

While a senior official in the Energy Authority said that the causes of the leak may be most likely caused by accidental damage, ruling out that the leak was the result of an act of sabotage.

The Russian Interfax news agency quoted Transneft as saying that it had informed the Polish side of the leak, and that oil supplies to Poland were still continuing despite the leak from the Druzhba pipeline.

Druzhba means friendship, and is the longest oil pipeline in the world, carrying oil from the eastern region of Russia to points in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Germany.

Europe has been on high alert over energy infrastructure security, since major leaks were discovered last month in the Nord Stream-1 and 2 gas pipelines that run from Russia to Europe under the Baltic Sea.

The European Union - with the exception of 3 of its members - is preparing to ban the import of Russian oil from the fifth of next December, and also to prevent European insurance companies from covering its transfers to other destinations outside the European Union, due to the war that Moscow is waging against Kyiv."

Earlier this year, the EU began membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania, pushing those two nations a step forward in a process held up for years as other Balkan countries advanced their accession bids.

The Directive is now working its way through the European Parliament, subject to amendments. Essentially, the Directive places substantive obligations on companies to identify, prevent and remedy adverse human rights and environmental risks in companies' ""value chains.""1

To Which Companies Does the Directive Apply?

Notably, the Directive will apply to certain companies formed both (1) within the EU, and (2) outside the EU but operating in the EU.

(1) For a company that is formed within the EU, the Directive will apply if it also meets one of the following criteria:
• Had more than 500 employees on average and a net worldwide turnover of €150 million, in the last financial year for which financial statements have been prepared; or
• Did not meet the thresholds outlined in a), but had more than 250 employees on average, and had a net turnover of more than €40 million in the last financial year for which annual financial statements have been prepared, with at least 50% of the net turnover generated in one or more of the following sectors:
• Manufacture of textiles, leather and related products (including footwear), and the wholesale trade of textiles, clothing and footwear;
• Agriculture, forestry, fisheries (including aquaculture), the manufacture of food products, and the wholesale trade of agricultural raw materials, live animals, wood, food, and beverages;
• Extraction of mineral resources, the manufacture of basic metal products, other non-metallic mineral products and fabricated metal products (except machinery and equipment), and the wholesale trade of mineral resources, basic and intermediate mineral products (including metals and metal ores, construction materials, fuels, chemicals and other intermediate products).

(2) For a company that is formed outside the EU, the Directive will apply if it also meets one of the following criteria:
• Generated a net turnover of more than €150 million in the EU in the financial year preceding the last financial year; or
• Generated a net turnover of more than €40 million but less than €150 million in the EU in the financial year preceding the last financial year, provided that at least 50% of its net worldwide turnover was generated in one or more of the sectors listed above.2

What Specific Obligations Are Placed on Companies?

The Directive places obligations on Member States to ensure that companies conduct human rights and environmental due diligence by carrying out a number of actions, including:3
• Integrating due diligence into their corporate policies, and to have in place a due diligence policy (updated and published annually) containing a description of the company's approach to due diligence (including in the long term), a code of conduct for employees and subsidiaries, and a description of the processes in place to implement due diligence;
• Identifying actual or potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts arising out of their own operations or those of their subsidiaries, and where related to their value chains, from their established business relationships;
• Preventing and minimizing potential adverse impacts and bringing actual adverse impacts to an end and mitigating their extent. The Directive sets out of number of actions companies should take to this extent. For example, such actions may include seeking contractual assurances from business partners to ensure their compliance with the company's code of conduct, and so on through the value chain; or to suspend or terminate commercial or business relationships with partners in their value chain in connection with adverse impacts that have arisen, as permitted by governing law;
• Monitoring the effectiveness of their due diligence policy and measures; and
• Publicly communicating on due diligence by publishing an annual statement on their website.

What Will Be the Consequences for Non-Compliance?

The Directive requires Member States to establish sanctions for non-compliance with the national provisions adopted in accordance with the Directive, and will leave it to Member States to determine the rules governing such sanctions.4 When determining whether to impose sanctions and to what extent, due account must be given to the company's efforts to comply with any remedial action required of them by a supervisory authority (a Member State designee charged with the supervision of compliance with the obligations laid down in the national provisions adopted pursuant to the Directive), any investments made and any targeted support provided pursuant to the requirement to prevent potential adverse impacts and to end actual adverse impacts, as well as collaboration with other entities to address adverse impacts in its value chains, as applicable.

Furthermore, the Directive also requires that Member States make civil liability mechanisms available to find companies liable for damages where they have failed to comply with their obligations to prevent potential adverse impacts, and to end actual adverse impacts, and where, as a result of this failure, the adverse impact that should have been identified, prevented, minimized, brought to an end, or its extent mitigated, occurred and led to damage.5

When Will the Directive Come into Force?

There is no set date for the Directive to come into force, particularly as it is not yet in its final form. It must work its way through the EU Parliament, and then passed to the EU Council.

Once finalized and entered into force, Member States will have two years to transpose the Directive into their local law.6 The provisions of the local law will apply to the companies outlined in 1(a) and 2(a) above two years from the entry into force of the Directive, and to the companies outlined in 1(b) and 2(b) above four years from the entry into force of the Directive.7

Update on Other Human Rights Due Diligence and Transparency Mandates:

Norway's ""Act Relating to Enterprises' Transparency and Work on Fundamental Human Rights and Decent Working Conditions""

While the EU Directive is still being debated and finalized, many EU countries have, for years, been developing and implementing their own corporate human rights due diligence and transparency obligations.8 One country that has done so recently is Norway.

On July 1, 2022, Norway's Act relating to enterprises' transparency and work on fundamental human rights and decent working conditions was entered into force (the ""Norwegian Act""). More information about the obligations imposed on companies under the Norwegian Act is outlined in our previous Insight.

While still under review, The Responsible Sustainable International Business Conduct Act (the ""Dutch Act"") is proposed to enter into force on January 1, 2023 (with the exception of Sections 3.2 to 3.6 (provisions in relation to supervision and enforcement),9 which are intended to enter into force at later dates).

What Specific Obligations are Placed on Companies?

The Dutch Act imposes a duty of care applicable to every ""enterprise""10 that knows, or can reasonably suspect, that its activities may have negative impacts on human rights, labor rights, or the environment on countries outside of the Netherlands. All enterprises must (a) take all measures reasonably required to prevent such impacts; (b) to the extent such impacts are not preventable, mitigate or reverse them to the extent possible and, where necessary, enable remediation; and (c) to the extent that such impacts cannot be limited sufficiently, refrain from the relevant activity, insofar as may reasonably be expected from the enterprise.

Certain enterprises (which meet the criteria outlined below) must adhere to additional due diligence obligations, including:
• Publishing and implementing a policy document that outlines the enterprise's commitment to the obligation of due diligence in their value chain(s), and the enterprise's due diligence plan.
• Conducting a risk analysis and developing an action plan to prevent, mitigate and address potential and actual negative impacts.
• Ceasing activities that cause or contribute to negative impacts on human rights, labor rights, or the environment.
• Monitoring the application and results of due diligence measures.
• Reporting annually on the due diligence policy and measures.
• Ensuring an appropriate remediation mechanism is in place, and remediation (or contribution to remediation) of negative impacts caused (or contributed to) by the enterprise.11

These obligations apply only to enterprises that (a) engage in activities outside of the Netherlands, and (b) exceed at least two of the three following criteria on their balance sheet date: (i) balance sheet total of €20 million; (ii) net revenue of €40 million; or (iii) an average of 250 employees during the financial year.

While the EU and a number of its Member States are developing their own approaches to human rights due diligence, transparency, and corporate social responsibility, other countries are also doing the same. Two of the most recent jurisdictions to do so are Switzerland and Japan.

In January 2022, the Swiss Code of Obligations (""CO"") was amended to introduce two new categories of corporate human rights reporting obligations: (1) annual reporting obligations on ""non-financial matters,"" including environmental matters, CO goals, social issues, employee-related issues, respect for human rights, and combating corruption,12 (""Non-Financial Reporting Obligations"") and (2) supply chain and reporting obligations with respect to minerals and metals from conflict-affected areas and child labor (""Conflict Area and Child Labor Reporting Obligations"").

To Which Companies Do the Non-Financial Reporting Obligations Apply?
• Companies of ""public interest"" (as defined in Article 2 letter c of the Auditor Oversight Act of 16 December 2005);13
• the Swiss or foreign companies that they control with at least 500 full-time equivalent positions on average over two successive financial years; and
• the Swiss or foreign companies that they control that exceed (a) a balance sheet total of 20 million francs, and/or (b) sales revenue of 40 million francs, in two successive financial years.

These reporting obligations do not apply to companies controlled by another company that is a company of ""public interest,"" or that must prepare an equivalent report under foreign law.14

What are the Specific Non-Financial Reporting Obligations Placed on Companies?

The report on non-financial matters must cover the above-aforementioned topics, and contain the information required to understand the business performance, the business result, the state of the company and the effects of its activity on the non-financial matters. In particular, the report must include:
• A description of the policies adopted in relation to the matters referred to in paragraph 1, including the due diligence applied;
• A presentation of the measures taken to implement these policies and an assessment of the effectiveness of these measures;
• A description of the main risks related to the matters referred to in paragraph 1, and how the company is dealing with these risks; in particular, the risks (a) that arise from the company's own business operations; and (b) provided this is relevant and proportionate, that arise from its business relationships, products or services; and
• The main performance indicators for the company's activities in relation to the matters referred to in paragraph 1.15

The report must be published online and remain publicly accessible for at least 10 years.16

To Which Companies Do the Conflict Area and Child Labor Reporting Obligations Apply?

Companies whose seat, head office or principal place of business is located in Switzerland must comply with obligations of due diligence in the supply chain and report on this if (a) they place in free circulation or process in Switzerland minerals containing tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold or metals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas; or (b) they offer products or services in relation to which there is a reasonable suspicion that they have been manufactured or provided using child labor.17

What Are the Specific Conflict Area and Child Labor Reporting Obligations Placed on Companies?

Companies must maintain a management system, which must stipulate the following:
• The supply chain policy for minerals and metals that potentially originate from conflict-affected and high-risk areas;
• The supply chain policy for products or services in relation to which there is a reasonable suspicion of child labor; and
• A system by which the supply chain can be traced.

Companies are required to identify and assess the risks of harmful impacts in their supply chain(s), and develop a risk-management plan and take measures to minimize the risks identified. Compliance with the due diligence obligations in relation to minerals and metals must be audited by an independent specialist.18

Companies are required to prepare an annual report on compliance with due diligence obligations. The report must be published online within six months of the end of the financial year and remain publicly accessible for at least 10 years.19

Japan's Draft Guidelines on Respect for Human Rights in Responsible Supply Chains

Partly influenced by the EU Directive that will apply to certain non-EU companies, the Japanese government has also published guidelines for companies to detect and prevent human rights violations in their supply chains.

Japan's ""Guidelines for Respect for Human Rights in Responsible Supply Chains"" (the ""Guidelines"") are not legally binding, but are presented as guidance to all business enterprises, regardless of size or sector, engaging in business activities in Japan. Under the Guidelines, business enterprises are urged to establish a human rights policy, conduct human rights due diligence (based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) and provide a remedy when business enterprises cause or contribute to adverse human rights impacts.20

These legislative developments add to the clear trend towards the global development of legislation addressing corporate human rights due diligence and disclosure obligations. As these developments increase in number, multinational employers should take stock of their global operations, and identify areas in those operations where there is a high risk of human rights violations, including forced labor and other modern slavery practices. Where such risks are identified, those employers should take appropriate action to address those risks and implement procedures to ensure that new and existing relationships remain free of such activities. Because this due diligence process can be complex, it is recommended that employers engage the expertise of experienced counsel.

1 ""Value chain"" is generally defined as activities related to the production of a good or provision of services by a company, including the development of the product or the service and the use and disposal of the product as well as the related activities of upstream and downstream established business relationships of the company.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — An oil leak was detected on a pipeline in Poland that’s the main route through which Russian crude reaches Germany, the pipeline’s Polish operator said Wednesday.

The operator, PERN, said it detected a leak in the Druzhba pipeline on Tuesday evening 70 kilometers (45 miles) from the central Polish city of Plock. It said the cause of the leak wasn’t known.

The incident follows leaks late last month in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines running along the Baltic seabed, and amid an energy standoff between Russia and the West over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Denmark and Sweden say those natural gas pipelines were attacked with large amounts of explosives.

The Druzhba pipeline, which in Russian means “Friendship,” is one of the world’s longest oil pipelines. After leaving Russia, it branches out to bring crude to points including Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Austria and Germany.

A Polish government security official, Stanislaw Zaryn, said the leak could be the result of an accident, but that officials were still investigating and were looking at all possible explanations.

“Different scenarios are possible. We don’t exclude any of them,” he told The Associated Press.

Firefighters were working in cornfields near the village of Zurawice to determine the exact point of the leak, according to a spokesman for firefighters, Brig. Karol Kierzkowski. He told the state news broadcaster TVP Info that approximately 400 cubic meters of spilled crude had been pumped out, and transmission along the line had been blocked off.

Germany’s Economy Ministry said that Berlin’s supplies are currently secure, with two German refineries continuing to receive supplies via the Druzhba pipeline. It said reserves at those two refineries have been increased in recent weeks, and that both can, if needed, be supplied via the German port of Rostock and the Polish port of Gdansk.

Last year, Russia accounted for around 35% of Germany’s crude oil supply. But that proportion has been reduced following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February. Germany’s focus now is on phasing out the remaining supplies before a European Union embargo on most Russian imports goes into effect. An European Union embargo on most Russia oil goes into effect on Dec. 5.

A month ago, the German government took control of three refineries owned by Russian energy company Rosneft, which account for about 12% of Germany’s oil refining capacity."

First of all, the territorial integrity of Armenia must be preserved and Azerbaijan must withdraw from the territory of Armenia in accordance with the ceasefire agreement of 10 November 2020”, he said during the PACE current affairs debate on military hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan, including strikes against settlements and civilian infrastructures.

He added that as member states of the Council of Europe, both sides must respect the rights of prisoners of war and commit themselves not to organize abductions. “However, the press reports videos circulating on social networks showing Armenians being abducted and tortured by Azeri soldiers. Azerbaijan must investigate these incidents and bring the perpetrators to justice.

Finally, I call on both states to quickly negotiate a peace agreement that must be respected. To this end, the Council of Europe must fully play its role as a pan-European platform for discussion and contribute through political dialogue to an easing of tensions and respect for the fundamental rights of the citizens of both States.

The international community cannot remain indifferent to the situation in this region. The European Union and the United States, but also Russia and Turkey, must work together to resolve this conflict.

Recently, the European Union (EU), Switzerland, and Japan have rolled out such laws, described below:

In October 2021, we reported on the EU’s Draft Directive on Corporate Due Diligence and Corporate Accountability (the “Draft Directive”). At that time, the Draft Directive was being reviewed by the European Commission. Based on the Draft Directive, on February 23, 2022, the European Commission adopted proposed legislation on corporate sustainability due diligence (the “Directive”).

The Directive is now working its way through the European Parliament, subject to amendments. Essentially, the Directive places substantive obligations on companies to identify, prevent and remedy adverse human rights and environmental risks in companies’ “value chains.”1

To Which Companies Does the Directive Apply?

Notably, the Directive will apply to certain companies formed both (1) within the EU, and (2) outside the EU but operating in the EU.

(1) For a company that is formed within the EU, the Directive will apply if it also meets one of the following criteria:
• Had more than 500 employees on average and a net worldwide turnover of €150 million, in the last financial year for which financial statements have been prepared; or
• Did not meet the thresholds outlined in a), but had more than 250 employees on average, and had a net turnover of more than €40 million in the last financial year for which annual financial statements have been prepared, with at least 50% of the net turnover generated in one or more of the following sectors:
• Manufacture of textiles, leather and related products (including footwear), and the wholesale trade of textiles, clothing and footwear;
• Agriculture, forestry, fisheries (including aquaculture), the manufacture of food products, and the wholesale trade of agricultural raw materials, live animals, wood, food, and beverages;
• Extraction of mineral resources, the manufacture of basic metal products, other non-metallic mineral products and fabricated metal products (except machinery and equipment), and the wholesale trade of mineral resources, basic and intermediate mineral products (including metals and metal ores, construction materials, fuels, chemicals and other intermediate products).

(2) For a company that is formed outside the EU, the Directive will apply if it also meets one of the following criteria:
• Generated a net turnover of more than €150 million in the EU in the financial year preceding the last financial year; or
• Generated a net turnover of more than €40 million but less than €150 million in the EU in the financial year preceding the last financial year, provided that at least 50% of its net worldwide turnover was generated in one or more of the sectors listed above.2

What Specific Obligations Are Placed on Companies?

The Directive places obligations on Member States to ensure that companies conduct human rights and environmental due diligence by carrying out a number of actions, including:3
• Integrating due diligence into their corporate policies, and to have in place a due diligence policy (updated and published annually) containing a description of the company’s approach to due diligence (including in the long term), a code of conduct for employees and subsidiaries, and a description of the processes in place to implement due diligence;
• Identifying actual or potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts arising out of their own operations or those of their subsidiaries, and where related to their value chains, from their established business relationships;
• Preventing and minimizing potential adverse impacts and bringing actual adverse impacts to an end and mitigating their extent. The Directive sets out of number of actions companies should take to this extent. For example, such actions may include seeking contractual assurances from business partners to ensure their compliance with the company’s code of conduct, and so on through the value chain; or to suspend or terminate commercial or business relationships with partners in their value chain in connection with adverse impacts that have arisen, as permitted by governing law;
• Monitoring the effectiveness of their due diligence policy and measures; and
• Publicly communicating on due diligence by publishing an annual statement on their website.

What Will Be the Consequences for Non-Compliance?

The Directive requires Member States to establish sanctions for non-compliance with the national provisions adopted in accordance with the Directive, and will leave it to Member States to determine the rules governing such sanctions.4 When determining whether to impose sanctions and to what extent, due account must be given to the company’s efforts to comply with any remedial action required of them by a supervisory authority (a Member State designee charged with the supervision of compliance with the obligations laid down in the national provisions adopted pursuant to the Directive), any investments made and any targeted support provided pursuant to the requirement to prevent potential adverse impacts and to end actual adverse impacts, as well as collaboration with other entities to address adverse impacts in its value chains, as applicable.

Furthermore, the Directive also requires that Member States make civil liability mechanisms available to find companies liable for damages where they have failed to comply with their obligations to prevent potential adverse impacts, and to end actual adverse impacts, and where, as a result of this failure, the adverse impact that should have been identified, prevented, minimized, brought to an end, or its extent mitigated, occurred and led to damage.5

When Will the Directive Come into Force?

There is no set date for the Directive to come into force, particularly as it is not yet in its final form. It must work its way through the EU Parliament, and then passed to the EU Council.

Once finalized and entered into force, Member States will have two years to transpose the Directive into their local law.6 The provisions of the local law will apply to the companies outlined in 1(a) and 2(a) above two years from the entry into force of the Directive, and to the companies outlined in 1(b) and 2(b) above four years from the entry into force of the Directive.7

Update on Other Human Rights Due Diligence and Transparency Mandates:

Norway’s “Act Relating to Enterprises’ Transparency and Work on Fundamental Human Rights and Decent Working Conditions”

While the EU Directive is still being debated and finalized, many EU countries have, for years, been developing and implementing their own corporate human rights due diligence and transparency obligations.8 One country that has done so recently is Norway.

On July 1, 2022, Norway’s Act relating to enterprises’ transparency and work on fundamental human rights and decent working conditions was entered into force (the “Norwegian Act”). More information about the obligations imposed on companies under the Norwegian Act is outlined in our previous Insight.

While still under review, The Responsible Sustainable International Business Conduct Act (the “Dutch Act”) is proposed to enter into force on January 1, 2023 (with the exception of Sections 3.2 to 3.6 (provisions in relation to supervision and enforcement),9 which are intended to enter into force at later dates).

What Specific Obligations are Placed on Companies?

The Dutch Act imposes a duty of care applicable to every “enterprise”10 that knows, or can reasonably suspect, that its activities may have negative impacts on human rights, labor rights, or the environment on countries outside of the Netherlands. All enterprises must (a) take all measures reasonably required to prevent such impacts; (b) to the extent such impacts are not preventable, mitigate or reverse them to the extent possible and, where necessary, enable remediation; and (c) to the extent that such impacts cannot be limited sufficiently, refrain from the relevant activity, insofar as may reasonably be expected from the enterprise.

Certain enterprises (which meet the criteria outlined below) must adhere to additional due diligence obligations, including:
• Publishing and implementing a policy document that outlines the enterprise’s commitment to the obligation of due diligence in their value chain(s), and the enterprise’s due diligence plan.
• Conducting a risk analysis and developing an action plan to prevent, mitigate and address potential and actual negative impacts.
• Ceasing activities that cause or contribute to negative impacts on human rights, labor rights, or the environment.
• Monitoring the application and results of due diligence measures.
• Reporting annually on the due diligence policy and measures.
• Ensuring an appropriate remediation mechanism is in place, and remediation (or contribution to remediation) of negative impacts caused (or contributed to) by the enterprise.11

These obligations apply only to enterprises that (a) engage in activities outside of the Netherlands, and (b) exceed at least two of the three following criteria on their balance sheet date: (i) balance sheet total of €20 million; (ii) net revenue of €40 million; or (iii) an average of 250 employees during the financial year.

While the EU and a number of its Member States are developing their own approaches to human rights due diligence, transparency, and corporate social responsibility, other countries are also doing the same. Two of the most recent jurisdictions to do so are Switzerland and Japan.

In January 2022, the Swiss Code of Obligations (“CO”) was amended to introduce two new categories of corporate human rights reporting obligations: (1) annual reporting obligations on “non-financial matters,” including environmental matters, CO goals, social issues, employee-related issues, respect for human rights, and combating corruption,12 (“Non-Financial Reporting Obligations”) and (2) supply chain and reporting obligations with respect to minerals and metals from conflict-affected areas and child labor (“Conflict Area and Child Labor Reporting Obligations”).

To Which Companies Do the Non-Financial Reporting Obligations Apply?
• Companies of “public interest” (as defined in Article 2 letter c of the Auditor Oversight Act of 16 December 2005);13
• the Swiss or foreign companies that they control with at least 500 full-time equivalent positions on average over two successive financial years; and
• the Swiss or foreign companies that they control that exceed (a) a balance sheet total of 20 million francs, and/or (b) sales revenue of 40 million francs, in two successive financial years.

These reporting obligations do not apply to companies controlled by another company that is a company of “public interest,” or that must prepare an equivalent report under foreign law.14

What are the Specific Non-Financial Reporting Obligations Placed on Companies?

The report on non-financial matters must cover the above-aforementioned topics, and contain the information required to understand the business performance, the business result, the state of the company and the effects of its activity on the non-financial matters. In particular, the report must include:
• A description of the policies adopted in relation to the matters referred to in paragraph 1, including the due diligence applied;
• A presentation of the measures taken to implement these policies and an assessment of the effectiveness of these measures;
• A description of the main risks related to the matters referred to in paragraph 1, and how the company is dealing with these risks; in particular, the risks (a) that arise from the company’s own business operations; and (b) provided this is relevant and proportionate, that arise from its business relationships, products or services; and
• The main performance indicators for the company’s activities in relation to the matters referred to in paragraph 1.15

The report must be published online and remain publicly accessible for at least 10 years.16

To Which Companies Do the Conflict Area and Child Labor Reporting Obligations Apply?

Companies whose seat, head office or principal place of business is located in Switzerland must comply with obligations of due diligence in the supply chain and report on this if (a) they place in free circulation or process in Switzerland minerals containing tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold or metals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas; or (b) they offer products or services in relation to which there is a reasonable suspicion that they have been manufactured or provided using child labor.17

What Are the Specific Conflict Area and Child Labor Reporting Obligations Placed on Companies?

Companies must maintain a management system, which must stipulate the following:
• The supply chain policy for minerals and metals that potentially originate from conflict-affected and high-risk areas;
• The supply chain policy for products or services in relation to which there is a reasonable suspicion of child labor; and
• A system by which the supply chain can be traced.

Companies are required to identify and assess the risks of harmful impacts in their supply chain(s), and develop a risk-management plan and take measures to minimize the risks identified. Compliance with the due diligence obligations in relation to minerals and metals must be audited by an independent specialist.18

Companies are required to prepare an annual report on compliance with due diligence obligations. The report must be published online within six months of the end of the financial year and remain publicly accessible for at least 10 years.19

Japan’s Draft Guidelines on Respect for Human Rights in Responsible Supply Chains

Partly influenced by the EU Directive that will apply to certain non-EU companies, the Japanese government has also published guidelines for companies to detect and prevent human rights violations in their supply chains.

Japan’s “Guidelines for Respect for Human Rights in Responsible Supply Chains” (the “Guidelines”) are not legally binding, but are presented as guidance to all business enterprises, regardless of size or sector, engaging in business activities in Japan. Under the Guidelines, business enterprises are urged to establish a human rights policy, conduct human rights due diligence (based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) and provide a remedy when business enterprises cause or contribute to adverse human rights impacts.20

These legislative developments add to the clear trend towards the global development of legislation addressing corporate human rights due diligence and disclosure obligations. As these developments increase in number, multinational employers should take stock of their global operations, and identify areas in those operations where there is a high risk of human rights violations, including forced labor and other modern slavery practices. Where such risks are identified, those employers should take appropriate action to address those risks and implement procedures to ensure that new and existing relationships remain free of such activities. Because this due diligence process can be complex, it is recommended that employers engage the expertise of experienced counsel."

“It is causing instability, and risks spilling over into our economies as a whole and provoking social unrest.”

Gas prices across Asia are half of those in Europe, and in the US the cost is around 10 times less, threatening the competitiveness of European business and endangering investment into the European Union (EU) Member States.

Where the European Commission will act to take strong action to counter these impacts, the VP called for a unified stance across the EU nations. The crisis presented an opportunity to modernise and decarbonise the economy, reinforce resilience and achieve “strategic autonomy” from outside actors like Russia, Šefčovič argued.

“Energy storage will play a key role in this effort. It will help facilitate the integration of renewables and the electrification of the economy, while increasing the flexibility and security of the energy system.

“Storages will be critical to reducing energy prices by pushing expensive gas power plants out of the market during peak price hours.”

Vice president Šefčovič highlighted that in the short-term the potential of batteries, and in the longer-term power-to-X technologies must be “exploited to make the most of the current global storage revolution”.

REPowerEU, the union’s energy strategy put together in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting systemic shocks to energy markets, is in many ways an exit strategy for dependence on Russian fossil fuel imports.

Regular readers of Energy-Storage.news will note that while energy storage was absent from a leaked early draft of the plan, later versions did include some mention of the importance of the technologies, albeit fairly briefly.

This had led to calls from the energy storage and adjacent industries as well as from clean energy advocates for more firm consideration of storage, including suggestions REPowerEU could include energy storage deployment targets.

Analysts at EASE had modelled a need for around 14GW a year of new storage deployments in Europe, to meet a forecasted 190GW requirement by 2030, and in stark contrast to just 1GW installed on the continent during 2021.

Most recently, an open letter from a group of CEOs of energy storage companies and European national trade associations reinforced the call for energy storage to be prioritised, a letter to which there are now more than 24 signatories.

In September, the secretary general of EASE, Patrick Clerens welcomed the focus of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on energy security in her annual State of the Union Address, in which von der Leyen likened the situation of today to the OPEC-driven fossil fuels crisis of the 1970s.

“We should have used that crisis as a catalyst to fully commit to green solutions, achieving energy security, low prices, and decarbonisation. We must learn from our past mistakes: stay the course on climate targets and deploy energy storage to replace fossil fuels imports,” Clerens said at the time.

“This crisis should be a wake-up call: the technology is there, but we need better market design and a comprehensive energy storage strategy.”

One industry expert, Corentin Baschet of consultancy Clean Horizon, had told Energy-Storage.news in September that it was likely EU policymakers were becoming attuned to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the continent’s energy markets and were starting to respond to the role storage could play.

In yesterday’s speech, Maroš Šefčovič indicated that those voices had indeed been heard, referring to the EU’s Clean Energy Package and how it sets out rules for the regulatory treatment of energy storage, and how REPowerEU continues to evolve to create a level playing field for different technologies and ensuring “adequate economic signals” are sent.

Šefčovič is also a driving force behind the European Battery Alliance, which has put billions of Euros into supporting the European battery value chain, from raw materials supply to manufacturing and implementing sustainability rules and other safeguards.

The European Commission VP said at the EASE conference that as well as deployment, progress in the whole value chain is a key priority, not least because the EU’s dependence on imports from China continues to grow.

Innovation should also be a focus, Šefčovič said, with funding from the Horizon Europe innovation programme going towards developing and improving “not only of existing technologies, like lithium-ion based batteries, but also new kinds like sodium-ion, and organic flow batteries”."

1067252316,20221012,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) – A new liquefied natural gas project off Africa’s western coast may only be 80% complete, but already the prospect of a new energy supplier has drawn visits from the leaders of Poland and Germany.

The initial field near Senegal and Mauritania´s coastlines is expected to contain about 15 trillion cubic feet (425 billion cubic meters) of gas, five times more than what gas-dependent Germany used in all of 2019. But production isn’t expected to start until the end of next year.

That won’t help solve Europe’s energy crisis triggered by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Still, Gordon Birrell, an executive for project co-developer BP, says the development “could not be more timely” as Europe seeks to reduce its reliance on Russian natural gas to power factories, generate electricity and heat homes.

“Current world events are demonstrating the vital role that (liquid gas) can play in underpinning the energy security of nations and regions,” he told an energy industry meeting in West Africa last month.

While Africa´s natural gas reserves are vast and North African countries like Algeria have pipelines already linked to Europe, a lack of infrastructure and security challenges have long stymied producers in other parts of the continent from scaling up exports. Established African producers are cutting deals or reducing energy use so they have more to sell to boost their finances, but some leaders warn that hundreds of millions of Africans lack electricity and supplies are needed at home.

Nigeria has Africa´s largest natural gas reserves, said Horatius Egua, a spokesman for the petroleum minister, though it accounts for only 14% of the European Union´s imports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, that comes by ship. Projects face the risk of energy thefts and high costs. Other promising countries like Mozambique have discovered large gas reserves only to see projects delayed by violence from Islamic militants.

Europe has been scrambling to secure alternative sources as Moscow has reduced natural gas flows to EU countries, triggering soaring energy prices and growing expectations of a recession. The 27-nation EU, whose energy ministers are meeting this week to discuss a gas price cap, is bracing for the possibility of a complete Russian cutoff but has still managed to fill gas reserves to 90%.

European leaders have flocked to countries like Norway, Qatar, Azerbaijan and especially those in North Africa, where Algeria has a pipeline running to Italy and another to Spain.

Italy signed a $4 billion gas deal with Algeria in July, a month after Egypt reached an agreement with the European Union and Israel to boost sales of LNG. Angola also has signed a gas deal with Italy.

While an earlier agreement allowed Italy’s biggest energy company to start production at two Algerian gas fields this week, it wasn’t clear when flows would start from the July deal because it lacked specifics, analysts said.

African leaders like Senegalese President Macky Sall want their countries to cash in on these projects even as they´re dissuaded from pursuing fossil fuels. They don´t want to export it all either – an estimated 600 million Africans lack access to electricity.

“It is legitimate, fair and equitable that Africa, the continent that pollutes the least and lags furthest behind in the industrialization process should exploit its available resources to provide basic energy, improve the competitiveness of its economy and achieve universal access to electricity,” Sall told the U.N. General Assembly last month.

Algeria is a major supplier – it and Egypt accounted for 60% of the natural gas production in Africa in 2020 – but it can’t offset Russian gas to Europe at this stage, said Mahfoud Kaoubi, professor of economics and specialist in energy issues at the University of Algiers.

“Russia has an annual production of 270 billion cubic meters – it´s huge,” Kaoubi said. “Algeria is 120 billion cubic meters, of which 70.50% is intended for consumption on the internal market.”

This year, Algeria is forecast to have piped exports of 31.8 billion cubic meters, according to Tom Purdie, a Europe, Middle East and Africa gas analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“The key concern here surrounds the level of production step-up that can be achieved, and the impact domestic demand could have” given how much gas Algeria uses at home, Purdie said.

Cash-strapped Egypt also is looking to export more natural gas to Europe, even regulating air conditioning in shopping malls and lights on streets to save energy and sell it instead.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly says Egypt hopes to bring in an additional $450 million a month in foreign currency by rerouting 15% of its domestic gas usage for export, state media reported.

More than 60% of Egypt´s natural gas consumption still is used by power stations to keep the country running. Most of its LNG goes to Asian markets.

A new, three-party deal will see Israel send more gas to Europe via Egypt, which has facilities to liquefy it for export by sea. The EU says it will help the two countries increase gas production and exploration.

In Nigeria, ambitious plans have yet to yield results despite years of planning. The country exported less than 1% of its vast natural gas reserves last year.

A proposed 4,400-kilometer-long (2,734-mile-long) pipeline that would take Nigerian gas to Algeria through Niger has been stalled since 2009, mainly because of its estimated cost of $13 billion.

Many fear that even if completed, the Trans-Sahara Gas Pipeline would face security risks like Nigeria’s oil pipelines, which have come under frequent attacks from militants and vandals.

The same challenges would hinder increased gas exports to Europe, said Olufola Wusu, a Lagos-based oil and gas expert.

“If you look at the realities on ground – issues that have to do with crude oil theft – and others begin to question our ability to supply gas to Europe,” he said.

Wusu urged pursuing LNG, calling it the “most profitable” gas strategy so far.

Even that isn’t without issues: In July, the head of Nigeria LNG Limited, the country´s largest natural gas firm, said its plant was producing at just 68% of capacity, mainly because its operations and earnings have been stifled by oil theft.

In the south, Mozambique is slated to become a major exporter of LNG after significant deposits were found along its Indian Ocean coast in 2010. France’s TotalEnergies invested $20 billion and started work to extract gas that would be liquefied in a plant it was building in Palma, in the northern Cabo Delgado province.

But Islamic extremist violence forced TotalEnergies to indefinitely scupper the project last year. Mozambican officials have pledged to secure the Palma area to allow work to resume.

Italian firm Eni, meanwhile, pressed ahead with plans to pump and liquefy some of its gas deposits discovered in Mozambique in 2011 and 2014. Eni established a platform in the Indian Ocean 50 miles (80 kilometers) offshore, away from the violence in Cabo Delgado.

It’s the first floating LNG facility in the deep waters off Africa, Eni says, with gas liquefaction capacity of 3.4 million tons per year.

The platform liquefied its first gas on Oct. 2, according to Africa Energy, and the first shipment is expected to depart for Europe in mid-October."
1067253591,20221012,"More than 50 Western countries met on Wednesday to promise more weapons for Ukraine, especially air defences after Russia launched its most intense missile strikes since the war began.

At the meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russia's latest attacks had laid bare its ""malice and cruelty"" since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Ukraine had shifted momentum since September with extraordinary gains, but would need more help, he said.

""These victories belong to Ukraine's brave soldiers. But the Contact Group's security assistance, training, and sustainment efforts have been vital,"" Austin said.

Russian attacks using more than 100 missiles have killed at least 26 people across Ukraine since Monday, when President Vladimir Putin ordered what he called retaliatory strikes against Ukraine for an explosion on a bridge.

Air raid sirens sounded across swathes of Ukraine for a third day on Wednesday and there were reports of some shelling, but no sign of a repeat of the intensive countrywide strikes of the previous two days.

The missiles have mostly targeted civilian electricity and heating infrastructure, while some hit busy roads, parks and tourist sites, including in the centre of Kyiv.

Transatlantic alliance NATO's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russia's missile attacks were a sign of weakness. ""Russia is actually losing on the battlefield,"" Stoltenberg said.

British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the Evening Standard people had underestimated Ukraine and overestimated Russia. ""But he (Putin) has got in his back pocket millions of people he can shove into a meat grinder with no rules, no regard for human lives and innocent people and civilians,"" he added.

Since Monday's attacks, Germany has sent the first of four planned IRIS-T SLM air defence systems, while Washington said it would speed up delivery of a promised NASAMS air defence system.

European Union energy ministers were also meeting in Prague to strategise over an energy crisis caused by the war.

Polish pipeline operator PERN said it had detected a leak in one pipe in the Druzhba system that carries oil from Russia to Europe, though it said the cause was probably an accident. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the leak appeared to have been eliminated.

Global attention has been focused on the security of Russian energy pipelines to Europe since the main undersea gas pipelines were damaged by suspected sabotage last month.

Western countries have not said who they blame for huge explosions that blew holes in the two Nord Stream 1 pipelines and one of two pipes that make up the new Nord Stream 2 project, but have implied they believe it was Russia.

Putin said on Wednesday gas could now be delivered through the remaining undamaged Nord Stream 2 pipe, but it was up to Europe to allow it. The new pipeline, completed but never opened, has been suspended by Germany since the invasion.

As his forces have lost ground on the battlefield since September, Putin has escalated the conflict, ordering the call-up of hundreds of thousands of reservists, proclaiming the annexation of occupied Ukrainian territory and repeatedly threatening to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia.

U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he doubted Putin would resort to that. Putin is a ""rational actor who has miscalculated significantly"", he told broadcaster CNN, saying he believed the Russian leader had expected his invading troops to be welcomed.

In Kyiv, residents cleaned up after this week's strikes.

""It is not that they are fighting the military, they are just driven by the desire to destroy, destroy, destroy us,"" said Yulia Datsenko, a 38-year-old paramedic, as she surveyed damage to her apartment.

Pope Francis denounced the bombings, part of what he called a ""hurricane of violence"".

On the battlefield, the Ukrainian governor of partially occupied Donetsk province said seven people were killed in Russian shelling of a market in the frontline town of Avdiivka.

Ukraine's military said its forces consolidated control of several settlements recaptured from Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro River, near the Russian-occupied town of Beryslav in the Kherson region.

The Ukrainians broke through Russia's front line in the area at the start of October and have been advancing to try to cut off thousands of Russian troops from supply and escape routes across the river.

Russian news media reported explosions in Kherson and Melitopol in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine.

Also in the south, Russian missiles destroyed buildings in the Zaporizhzhia region overnight though there were no reports of casualties, regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said.

Video footage from Ukrainian emergency services showed a family being rescued from a flattened building following what it said was a missile strike in Zaporizhzhia. Reuters could not independently verify the location of the video or date it was filmed.

Ukraine's sixth-largest city, Zaporizhzhia is still controlled by Ukraine although Moscow claims to have annexed the surrounding province. The city has come under nightly Russian attacks since the annexation proclamation, including at least three apartment blocks destroyed while residents slept. Starukh said at least 70 people have been killed this month."
1067255905,20221012,"Presidency says return of refugees to Syria to start next week, despite objections by rights groups.

President Michel Aoun has said Lebanon will soon begin sending Syrian refugees back to their home country, despite concerns by rights groups over their safety.

“As of next week, we will see the start of returning Syrians to their home country in batches,” the Lebanese presidency said in a Twitter post on Wednesday, without providing further details.

Lebanon hosts the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. The government estimated that the country’s population of more than six million includes roughly 1.5 million refugees from neighbouring Syria, though well under one million are registered with the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR).

In its September report (PDF), the UN’s Syria commission said the country “is still not a safe place to return”.

An official source told the Reuters news agency the returns would only include those who had voluntarily signed up to go back with Lebanon’s General Security agency, in coordination with the country’s social affairs ministry, and would not be forced to leave.

Issam Charafeddine, Lebanon’s minister for displaced people, in July announced a plan that he said would seek to return some 15,000 refugees to Syria per month, basing his move on a claim that the country had become largely safe after more than a decade of war.

The plan would not involve the UNHCR, which maintains that conditions in Syria do not allow for the large-scale return of refugees.

Lebanese officials say the influx of refugees has cost the crisis-hit country billions of dollars and further damaged its crippled infrastructure while it struggles with a financial meltdown.

The UNHCR has in the past opposed involuntary repatriation of refugees to Syria, and warned that the practice risks endangering the lives of those returning.

Currently, UNHCR is “not facilitating or promoting the large-scale voluntary repatriation of refugees to Syria”, Paula Barrachina, UNHCR’s spokesperson in Lebanon, told Al Jazeera.

“Nonetheless, thousands of refugees choose to exercise their right to return each year. UNHCR supports and calls for respect of refugees’ fundamental human right to freely and voluntarily return to their country of origin at a time of their choosing,” Barrachina said, adding that the body will continue to “engage in dialogue with the Lebanese Government”.

New York-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) had also said at the time that “Syria is anything but safe for returnees.”

“Syrian refugees who returned between 2017 and 2021 from Lebanon and Jordan faced grave human rights abuses and persecution at the hands of the Syrian government and affiliated militias,” Lama Fakih, director of HRW’s Middle East Division, wrote in a post.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad issued a sweeping amnesty earlier this year for a range of crimes which said it includes those committed by Syrians who fled their country during the 11-year conflict.

Syrian authorities have also said they have eased measures for those who have fled their compulsory military service, a major push factor for young men fleeing Syria, including to Lebanon.

But rights groups and diplomats have warned that those guarantees are not sufficient.

Since late 2019, poverty has worsened for both Lebanese and Syrians in Lebanon as the country continues to struggle with a crippling economic crisis.

Last month, dozens of Lebanese and Syrian migrants were stranded for days on a sinking fishing boat in the Mediterranean Sea. At least 94 of them died after the boat capsized off the Syrian port of Tartous, some 50km (30 miles) north of Tripoli in Lebanon.

Those on board resorted to using dangerous boat journeys in search of a better life.

Most of the boats setting off from Lebanon head for European Union member Cyprus, an island about 175km (110 miles) to the west."

• This milestone is one of the first results of the Quantum Spain program, promoted by the Spanish Government through the State Secretariat for Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence, and allows reinforcing the European leadership of the national Quantum Computing ecosystem, attracting an infrastructure that will involve an investment of 12.5 million euros.
• The BSC-CNS is a public consortium formed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation, the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC).

Spain has been one of six European countries selected by the European Union (EU) supercomputing consortium, the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU), to host and operate the first EuroHPC quantum computers. The new infrastructure will be installed at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS) and will be integrated into the MareNostrum 5 supercomputer, the most powerful in Spain and among the most advanced in Europe, in collaboration with the Institut de Física de Altes Energies (IFAE), and the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL), in Portugal.

The new quantum computer to be installed at the BSC will have the potential to significantly increase the impact of research and innovation by enabling solutions that go beyond the capabilities of current supercomputers. The investment, in the case of Spain, will be €12.5 million, co-financed 50% by the EU and the State Secretariat for Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (Secretaría de Estado de Digitalización e Inteligencia Artificial, SEDIA), an organization under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation.

This milestone is one of the first results of the Quantum Spain program, initiated in 2021 by the Spanish Government through the SEDIA and coordinated by the Spanish Supercomputing Network (RES). The program boosts and strengthens the national Quantum Computing ecosystem and aims to reinforce its role in Europe and attract investment to our country, with initiatives such as the one announced now.

The BSC-CNS is a public consortium formed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation, the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC).

""This new infrastructure, that will integrate quantum computing with MareNostrum 5, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, will allow us to advance multiple academic applications. This new milestone will enable BSC to play a decisive role in Europe in these new technologies that will be part of the society of the future and reinforces BSC's role as one of the leaders in supercomputing in Europe,"" says Mateo Valero, Director at BSC.

The new European quantum computing network will be available in the second half of 2023, primarily for R&D purposes, to a wide range of users, such as scientific communities, industry and the public sector, no matter where in Europe they are located. The infrastructure brings Europe closer to its digital objectives for this decade, in which the EU aims to be at the forefront of quantum capabilities, relying on national programs already underway, as is the case of Quantum Spain in our country.

In addition to Spain, the other five countries selected by the EuroHPC JU were Germany, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, and Poland. The new quantum computers will be integrated into existing supercomputers at the respective facilities, forming a broad European network that guarantees users access to different quantum technologies and architectures. The BSC, like the other selected European facilities, will be in charge of operating the new quantum computer on behalf of the EuroHPC JU.

The new quantum computers will address the growing demand for quantum computing resources and potential new services from European industry and academia, adding new capabilities to the European supercomputing network. They are expected to be able to solve complex problems more quickly in areas such as health, climate change, logistics or energy usage.

Potential applications of quantum computing include the optimization of traffic flows and fundamental numerical problems in chemistry and physics for the development of new drugs and materials.

This is a purely European initiative, as the new quantum computers will consist entirely of European hardware and software, leveraging European technology developed under EU-funded quantum initiatives, national research programmes, and private investments.

1067263252,20221012,"Bosnia-Herzegovina moved a small step closer to the European Union on Wednesday with the EU’s executive advising member states to grant it candidate member status despite continuing criticism of the way the Balkan nation is run.

The advice had been hotly anticipated in ethnically-divided Bosnia, which is lagging several other Balkan nations in being granted candidate status to become a member of the prosperous European club of 27 nations. For the EU itself, holding out the prospect of membership is a powerful instrument in the Balkans, where Russia, and China, are vying for more geopolitical clout.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi told a European Parliament committee during the presentation of the annual enlargement report that the executive ""recommends that candidate status be granted"" by the member states, pending a slew of commitments for fundamental reform.

Bosnia’s foreign minister welcomed the decision, describing it as ""historic.""

EU WANTS EUROPEAN NATIONS TO CRACK DOWN ON VISAS FOR RUSSIAN CITIZENS

""This sends a strong message to the citizens (of Bosnia), one we have been hoping to get even earlier, that our future is as a member of the (EU) family,"" Bisera Turkovic said on Twitter.

The recommendation comes more than 6 years after Bosnia formally applied to join the EU and nearly three decades since it emerged from a more than 3 ½ -year-long interethnic war, part of the breakup of Yugoslavia, that left more than 100,000 dead.

The Commission can only advise which nations should become EU candidates, and all member states must agree unanimously on such a step. Varhelyi said he hoped the member states would make a quick move, possibly as early as December, since the situation in the region spurred by Russia's war in Ukraine, made speed essential.

Still, once a country becomes a candidate, it can still take years, sometimes many years, before membership to the club becomes a reality.

EU TO TAKE MALTA TO COURT OVER 'GOLDEN PASSPORT' POLICY

""On our side, we made now a leap, a leap of faith,"" he said. ""Now the leadership must be there to deliver."" He said to become a candidate the Bosnian leaders needed reforms on issues ranging from the judiciary, to battling corruption and pushing through constitutional and electoral changes. Little progress on those issues has been made in recent years.

While Bosnia has professed its desire to join the EU since 2003, its bickering ethnic leaders have so far proven unwilling to put aside differences and implement necessary reforms. In fact, Bosnia recently found itself in the throes of its biggest political crisis since the end of the 1992-95 war, with the staunchly pro-Russian Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, increasingly threatening to separate Bosnia’s Serb-run part from the rest of the country.

The Commission made several non-encouraging assessments in many sectors, outlining limited or no progress in reforms of public administration, the judiciary and the fight against corruption and organized crime. To be a candidate, a nation does not have to meet all criteria, but must show a commitment to do so.

Many fear that even if completed, the Trans-Sahara Gas Pipeline would face security risks like Nigeria’s oil pipelines, which have come under frequent attacks from militants and vandals. The same challenges would hinder increased gas exports to Europe, said Olufola Wusu, a Lagos-based oil and gas expert.

 

 “If you look at the realities on ground — issues that have to do with crude oil theft — and others begin to question our ability to supply gas to Europe,” he said. Wusu urged pursuing LNG, calling it the “most profitable” gas strategy so far.

 

 Even that isn’t without issues: In July, the head of Nigeria LNG Limited, the country’s largest natural gas firm, said its plant was producing at just 68% of capacity, mainly because its operations and earnings have been stifled by oil theft. In the south, Mozambique is slated to become a major exporter of LNG after significant deposits were found along its Indian Ocean coast in 2010. France’s TotalEnergies invested $20 billion and started work to extract gas that would be liquefied in a plant it was building in Palma, in the northern Cabo Delgado province."

Niklasson said in a tweet that the education of women is important for progress in Afghanistan.

“Schools need to re-open, or open, across Afghanistan, offering girls of all ages access to quality education. The teachers, engineers, doctors, architects, civil servants and business leaders of tomorrow, building a more prosperous Afghanistan, together with their brothers,” said Tomas Niklasson.

Also, the US special envoy for Afghanistan’s human rights and women, Rina Amiri, said in a tweet that respecting the rights of all Afghans, particularly girls’ right to education, is important in Afghanistan.

“The Taliban should take note: there is no way to move forward & become a legitimate member of the international community without respecting the rights of all Afghans, particularly girls’ right to education. It is the foundation for any progress in Afghanistan,” said Rina Amiri, the US special envoy for Afghanistan’s human rights and women.

""Schools have to be reopened, that is what Afghanistan nations want and nobody has any logical reasons to stop girls from being educated,"" said Najibullah Jameh, a political expert.

""Unfortunately, schools are closed for girls in Afghanistan and girls are deprived of their basic rights, I hope that because of World Girls' Day, as we are members of the international community, schools reopen for girls,"" said Waheeda Adalatjo, women's rights activist.

Former President Hamid Karzai in a tweet called on girls to keep their morale up and pursue learning.

Meanwhile, Zabiullah Mujahid said that efforts are continuing to reopen girls’ schools according to Islamic law.

""Efforts are continuing, officials are trying to find solutions according to Islamic law,"" said Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Islamic Emirate.

Several female students urged the Islamic Emirate to reopen schools immediately.

""Closure of schools means closure of our hopes, dreams, we ask to reopen our schools as soon as possible,"" said Fahima, a student.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on the International Day of the Girl Child said that he is “extremely concerned by the continued exclusion of girls from school in Afghanistan.”"

“We have thanked for the eighth package but are already working on the ninth one, which is expected to include everything missed in the eighth and previous packages. All Russian and Belarusian banks, especially Gazprombank, are yet to be disconnected from the SWIFT,” Zhovkva told.

In his words, it is also necessary to impose price restrictions or fully ban Russian gas exports.

According to Zhovkva, European vessels should be prevented from entering Russian ports, and a visa ban should be imposed on all Russian citizens.

At the same time, it is worth raising an issue of sanctions against Belarus, Zhovkva noted. In particular, the Belarusian banking system should face the same restrictions as the Russian one.

Individual sanctions have already been imposed on Belarusian government officials, and it is important to expand them, Zhovkva added."
1067281441,20221012,"Hoboken, New Jersey, has eliminated traffic deaths for four years in a row. Between 2014 and 2018, there were 376 traffic-related injuries and three fatalities in the 60,000-person city located across the Hudson River from Manhattan, so Hoboken made an array of changes to create safer roads.

Among other things, the city removed drivers’ blind spots at intersections by restricting parking within 25 feet of crosswalks and programmed traffic lights to give pedestrians a head start before vehicles can turn.

The city has seen no traffic deaths since 2018, and other accidents have decreased, too. In 2020, vehicles collided with 35% fewer pedestrians, 11% fewer cyclists, and 27% fewer vehicles than in 2019.

The new safety initiatives are part of the city’s Vision Zero pledge to eliminate all traffic-related injuries and deaths by 2030, based on an action plan that originated in Sweden in 1997. While Hoboken has higher population density and walkability and lower speed limits in general than many urban areas, experts say planning techniques can prove effective in any city. Around the country, nearly 43,000 people died in vehicle crashes in 2021.

An Ivory Coast entrepreneur developed a smartphone to serve those who cannot read or write. Alain Capo-Chichi developed the phone, called Open G, to make it easier for his parents, who received minimal education, to send messages or transfer money. The locally made phone allows users to access apps and services by speaking in voice commands in 16 local dialects.

In Ivory Coast, the literacy rate has grown from below 45% in 2010 to over 80% in 2019. Open G, which went on sale in July and has already sold several thousand units, is designed to serve around one-third of adults in Africa who are not literate. The device joins a growing list of smartphones designed and produced in Africa, including Mara Phones in Rwanda and SICO in Egypt.

One of the oldest towns in Germany has transformed into an “edible city,” growing food accessible to all. Nestled in the Rhine River valley, the city of Andernach began planting organic food in its public green spaces in 2010. Since then, the city has grown a wide variety of produce, including zucchini, grapes, artichokes, and pumpkins, while also caring for bees for honey and chickens for eggs. Diverse species create habitats for birds, bees, and other insects.

Growing food locally has become more popular as a result of food chain instability and to cut down on carbon emissions. Out of 14 hectares (34 acres) of green space in Andernach, around 2 hectares are edible areas. “You just take what you need,” says one resident. “The only thing is you have to be quick once the fruits are ripe or they’ll all be gone!” The city is part of a European Union-funded project called the Edible Cities Network, which is running from 2018 to 2023. The city is working on cataloging its plants, nutrients, and water use to help other cities implement the model.

Substances known to deplete the ozone layer are at their lowest levels since 1980. Most of these human-made chemicals were phased out globally under the Montreal Protocol, signed by 46 countries in 1987. As a result of effective international cooperation, the most recent data shows levels of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) at 50% of their peak in the early 1990s.

“It’s great to see this progress,” said Stephen Montzka of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Global Monitoring Laboratory. “At the same time, it’s a bit humbling to realize that science is still a long way from being able to claim that the issue of ozone depletion is behind us.”

Given how slowly the ozone layer heals, it is expected to reach a near complete recovery by the middle of the century in most locations. The most worrisome hole in the ozone layer formed over Antarctica, where concentrations of ODS have fallen by 26%, and recovery is estimated by 2070.

Today, in a bilateral meeting with prime minister Mia Mottley, the European Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen, announced that the EU will provide funding of €4.38 million for the digitalisation of the hospital. This complements a €38.4 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank for the Barbados Public Sector Modernisation Programme that aims at the digital transformation of the public sector in Barbados.

“The EU's Global Gateway aims to create trusted links in connectivity and support the digital transformation with our partner countries, while advancing human development. As part of our engagement with Barbados and the newly-launched Caribbean-EU partnerships, we are committed to continue supporting Barbados in its digital transition. Through this package to Queen Elizabeth hospital, patient care is set to improve and will simplify operations for the dedicated staff at the facility, in line with our upcoming new Global Health Strategy.”

This EU support will work to increase productivity in the hospital, improve patient care, and reduce risks of medical errors in the long term. Improving the delivery of quality public services to its citizens is a major initiative of the Barbadian Government and the new EU support aims at helping the Government to accelerate modernising the health sector. Commissioner Urpilainen has travelled to Barbados for a two-day mission to the country to launch the Caribbean-EU Partnerships as well as the EU Youth Action Plan in the Latin American and Caribbean region.

1067282613,20211012,"(Bloomberg) -- Ukraine will need at least $3 billion a month next year to finance its wartime economy, which means allies will have to step up with more support, the head of the International Monetary Fund said.

“Our current thinking is that the financing requirements” will be around $3 billion to $4 billion a month, Kristalina Georgieva said at a meeting in Washington on Wednesday to discuss global economic support for Ukraine, according to a draft text of her comments.

Developments in the war “could push financing needs beyond this range,” as the government seeks to maintain basic social services, repair infrastructure and import energy, Georgieva said. “This requires actions on the part of the authorities but importantly also the international community.”

Ukraine’s allies, chiefly the US and European countries, have been helping Ukraine with cash to keep its economy afloat, as well as weapons to bolster its resistance against the Russian invasion that began in February. The numbers cited by Georgieva suggest there will be pressure to continue that aid all through next year.

The IMF chief said that Ukraine’s “international partners” have contributed a total of $35 billion in grants and loans so far this year. The Fund itself approved another $1.3 billion in new emergency financing last week. That will bring the total amount that it’s mobilized for Ukraine this year close to $5 billion.

The US, which has been the single biggest donor, has pushed other allies to do more. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been calling for stepped-up support this week. In her comments at the Wednesday meeting, Yellen cited the recent approval by Congress of another $4.5 billion in grant assistance for Ukraine, on top of $8.5 billion already disbursed.

“We welcome the efforts of all donors to meet Ukraine’s needs,” Yellen said, according to a draft text of her comments. “However, the scale, predictability and grant component of disbursements must improve.”

The European Union is in discussions to extend Ukraine around €18 billion ($17.5 billion) in funding next year, which would cover about half of what the country needs. The European Commission is still working on the details of the new plan and some elements, including the size of the package, haven’t been finalized, people familiar with the discussions said earlier this week. The proposal could come as soon as next week."
1067284376,20221012,"DAKAR, Senegal — A new liquefied natural gas project off Africa's western coast may only be 80% complete, but already the prospect of a new energy supplier has drawn visits from the leaders of Poland and Germany.

The initial field near Senegal and Mauritania's coastlines is expected to contain about 15 trillion cubic feet (425 billion cubic meters) of gas, five times more than what gas-dependent Germany used in all of 2019. But production isn't expected to start until the end of next year.

That won't help solve Europe's energy crisis triggered by Russia's war in Ukraine. Still, Gordon Birrell, an executive for project co-developer BP, says the development ""could not be more timely"" as Europe seeks to reduce its reliance on Russian natural gas to power factories, generate electricity and heat homes.

""Current world events are demonstrating the vital role that (liquid gas) can play in underpinning the energy security of nations and regions,"" he told an energy industry meeting in West Africa last month.

While Africa's natural gas reserves are vast and North African countries like Algeria have pipelines already linked to Europe, a lack of infrastructure and security challenges have long stymied producers in other parts of the continent from scaling up exports. Established African producers are cutting deals or reducing energy use so they have more to sell to boost their finances, but some leaders warn that hundreds of millions of Africans lack electricity and supplies are needed at home.

Nigeria has Africa's largest natural gas reserves, said Horatius Egua, a spokesman for the petroleum minister, though it accounts for only 14% of the European Union's imports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, that comes by ship. Projects face the risk of energy thefts and high costs. Other promising countries like Mozambique have discovered large gas reserves only to see projects delayed by violence from Islamic militants.

Europe has been scrambling to secure alternative sources as Moscow has reduced natural gas flows to EU countries, triggering soaring energy prices and growing expectations of a recession. The 27-nation EU, whose energy ministers are meeting this week to discuss a gas price cap, is bracing for the possibility of a complete Russian cutoff but has still managed to fill gas reserves to 90%.

European leaders have flocked to countries like Norway, Qatar, Azerbaijan and especially those in North Africa, where Algeria has a pipeline running to Italy and another to Spain.

Italy signed a $4 billion gas deal with Algeria in July, a month after Egypt reached an agreement with the European Union and Israel to boost sales of LNG. Angola also has signed a gas deal with Italy.

While an earlier agreement allowed Italy's biggest energy company to start production at two Algerian gas fields this week, it wasn't clear when flows would start from the July deal because it lacked specifics, analysts said.

African leaders like Senegalese President Macky Sall want their countries to cash in on these projects even as they're dissuaded from pursuing fossil fuels. They don't want to export it all either — an estimated 600 million Africans lack access to electricity.

""It is legitimate, fair and equitable that Africa, the continent that pollutes the least and lags furthest behind in the industrialization process should exploit its available resources to provide basic energy, improve the competitiveness of its economy and achieve universal access to electricity,"" Sall told the U.N. General Assembly last month.

Algeria is a major supplier — it and Egypt accounted for 60% of the natural gas production in Africa in 2020 — but it can't offset Russian gas to Europe at this stage, said Mahfoud Kaoubi, professor of economics and specialist in energy issues at the University of Algiers.

""Russia has an annual production of 270 billion cubic meters — it's huge,"" Kaoubi said. ""Algeria is 120 billion cubic meters, of which 70.50% is intended for consumption on the internal market.""

This year, Algeria is forecast to have piped exports of 31.8 billion cubic meters, according to Tom Purdie, a Europe, Middle East and Africa gas analyst with S&P Global Commodity Insights.

""The key concern here surrounds the level of production step-up that can be achieved, and the impact domestic demand could have"" given how much gas Algeria uses at home, Purdie said.

Cash-strapped Egypt also is looking to export more natural gas to Europe, even regulating air conditioning in shopping malls and lights on streets to save energy and sell it instead.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly says Egypt hopes to bring in an additional $450 million a month in foreign currency by rerouting 15% of its domestic gas usage for export, state media reported.

More than 60% of Egypt's natural gas consumption still is used by power stations to keep the country running. Most of its LNG goes to Asian markets.

A new, three-party deal will see Israel send more gas to Europe via Egypt, which has facilities to liquefy it for export by sea. The EU says it will help the two countries increase gas production and exploration.

In Nigeria, ambitious plans have yet to yield results despite years of planning. The country exported less than 1% of its vast natural gas reserves last year.

A proposed 2,734-mile-long pipeline that would take Nigerian gas to Algeria through Niger has been stalled since 2009, mainly because of its estimated cost of $13 billion.

France's TotalEnergies invested $20 billion and started work to extract gas that would be liquefied in a plant it was building in Palma, in the northern Cabo Delgado province.

But Islamic extremist violence forced TotalEnergies to indefinitely scupper the project last year. Mozambican officials have pledged to secure the Palma area to allow work to resume.

Italian firm Eni, meanwhile, pressed ahead with plans to pump and liquefy some of its gas deposits discovered in Mozambique in 2011 and 2014. Eni established a platform in the Indian Ocean 50 miles (80 kilometers) offshore, away from the violence in Cabo Delgado.

It's the first floating LNG facility in the deep waters off Africa, Eni says, with gas liquefaction capacity of 3.4 million tons per year.

The platform liquefied its first gas on Oct. 2, according to Africa Energy, and the first shipment is expected to depart for Europe in mid-October.

1067284378,20221012,"European Union member states agreed on Wednesday to new sanctions against Iran over the country's crackdown on protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, diplomats said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted: ""The brave Iranian women demand freedom and equality — values that Europe believes in and must speak up for. The violence must stop. Women must be able to choose. This shocking violence cannot stay unanswered. It's time to sanction those responsible for this repression.""

There were no specific details on what the sanctions might entail, but news agencies AFP and EFE said that agreement was reached among EU diplomats and will be ratified at the next foreign ministers' meeting to be held in Luxembourg on Monday.

The US, the UK and Canada have already separately targeted security branches of the Iranian regime as part of their sanctions against the Islamic Republic in the wake of the death of Amini. The 22-year-old died after being arrested by Iran's so-called morality police last month.

Among those sanctioned by the United States were Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi and Communications Minister Eisa Zarepour, as well as five other officials.

US President Joe Biden said Washington would increase costs on Iranian officials linked to violence against protesters.

Meanwhile, according to activists, protests over Amini's death continued in at least 19 cities across Iran on Wednesday.

The demonstrations were met with a massive deployment of riot police and plainclothes officers throughout Tehran and other cities, as authorities moved to quell the unrest.

According to the Associated Press, witnesses also described disruptions affecting their mobile internet services.

Advocacy group NetBlocks said that Iran's internet traffic had dropped to some 25% compared to the peak.

The move is ""likely to further limit the free flow of information amid protests,"" NetBlocks said.

Lawyers also demonstrated in front of the Iran Central Bar Association in the capital, chanting: ""Woman, life, freedom,"" a slogan synonymous with the protests.

The lawyers subsequently fled security forces after the authorities fired tear gas at them, the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said.

At least three lawyers were among the some two dozen arrested in Tehran, the center said.

""Lawyers willing to defend detainees arrested for peaceful protest are the last lifeline for a citizenry under attack by the Iranian government,"" said Hadi Ghaemi, the center's executive director. ""Protests must be allowed without the threat of lethal state violence or arbitrary arrest.""

Amini was arrested in Tehran last month for allegedly breaching Iran's strict dress code for women by wearing her hijab too loosely. She died on September 16, three days after she fell into a coma following her arrest.

The lawyer for Amini's family said ""respectable doctors"" believe she was hit in custody after being arrested by the Iranian ""morality police.""

They also say they were told by other detainees that she was severely beaten and added that they were not allowed to see her body.

Last week, Iran's Forensic Organization said her death was ""not caused by blows to the head and vital organs and limbs of the body.""

olice had previously claimed Amini suffered a heart attack after being taken to a police station to be ""educated.""

Rights groups say that more than 100 people, including children, have died since the protests broke out last month."

This is a significant move for peace and stability in the Western Balkans, the president’s office said in a press release on Wednesday.

Pahor’s office noted that the president had presented his initiative for candidate status for Bosnia and Herzegovina without conditions in February, before the Russian attack on Ukraine, which ultimately led to the latter being granted candidate status.

Pahor has argued that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s accession should not be viewed in a narrow administrative way of whether it meets conditions, but was a “first rate geopolitical issue”, the press release said.

Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhely announced the news today in the European Parliament, adding that the country must meet several conditions, including in the judiciary, corruption and freedom of speech. The final decision will be made by the European Council.

In June, Pahor discussed his initiative with Prime Minister Robert Golob, after which Pahor wrote a letter to European Council President Charles Michel, while Golob advocated for the move with the European Council.

Despite initial setbacks, Slovenia has succeeded that the European Council ordered the Commission to draft a report on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the president’s office said.

“Today’s decision by the European Union raises hope that Bosnia and Herzegovina will be granted candidate status at the December EU Summit,” the press release said.

Pahor believes this is a turning point for two reasons: because it marks the actual beginning of Bosnia’s European future, and because the move is of great importance for peace and stability in the Western Balkans."
