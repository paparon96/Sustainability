20220725,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken's team dismissed Russian claims that Western sanctions have exacerbated the global food crisis as Moscow hopes to convert the controversy into a political advantage in the developing world.

“The fact is that we have been very specific in designing this sanctions regime to see to it that food and fertilizer from Russia is entirely exempted, to see to it that companies around the world have the assurances that they need to export these products,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has insisted that Western sanctions architects developed measures to interfere with the logistics of Russian food and fertilizer exports, even as the products themselves remain free of sanctions. He acknowledged that Moscow has used Ukraine’s blockaded grain as leverage in this dispute while characterizing the war in Ukraine as a conflict over “the future of the world order,” one that Moscow hopes will undercut the primacy of “Western civilization” in global affairs.

“It will take a long time, but we are at the beginning of a new era, which would be a movement towards real multilateralism, not to the multilateralism which the West tries to impose on the basis of the exceptional role of the Western civilization in the modern world,” Lavrov said in Cairo during an address to the Arab League, a bloc of Arabic-speaking nation across Africa and the Middle East. “The world is much richer than just Western civilization. Who but not many of you representing the ancient civilizations should know this.”

UKRAINE HOPES TO RESUME GRAIN EXPORTS IN COMING DAYS AFTER STRIKE HIT ODESA

Lavrov touted the prospect of sidelining the American dollar in global transactions as a way to hasten that process and not “be dependent on the capricious behavior of the United States and its allies.” He cited the European Union’s recent decision to write an explicit exception for ""the purchase, import or transport of agricultural and food products, including wheat and fertilizers” to argue that Western allies have lied about their culpability for the food crisis.

“True, no sanctions have been imposed on food as such, but they were instantly imposed on the companies that provide insurance for food deliveries and ensure the corresponding payments,” he told reporters in Cairo before acknowledging that Russia tied the negotiations over Ukrainian food exports to this dispute. ""In the end, we insisted that the two issues be resolved as a package.”

The fragility of the “package” deal signed Friday became apparent on Saturday, when Russia conducted strikes on the port of Odesa. Lavrov insisted Monday that such attacks remain permissible under the terms of the agreement.

“In Odesa, there is nothing in ... the agreements signed on July 22 in Istanbul that can bar us from continuing the special military operation and hit military infrastructure and other military targets,” Lavrov said while traveling in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""As for the targets hit by high-precision weapons, they are located in a separate part of the Odesa port, the so-called military part.”

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who remains a senior government official, said in May that ""our food is our quiet weapon” in the war.

“Moscow's track record when it comes to previous deals that it has struck is not exactly a cause for optimism,” Price told reporters Monday. “It harkens back to what we heard and what we saw from Russia, in the context of the humanitarian corridors that were to have been open for evacuations of civilians and others from besieged cities. In some cases, those humanitarian corridors were open for just a few days, or in some cases just a few hours, before Moscow appeared to renege on its agreement.”

The blockade of the Black Sea ports has raised the specter of a dire food crisis in Africa, according to U.N. officials. “This is not just about Ukraine, this is about the global food supply of the entire world,” U.N. World Food Program Executive Director David Beasley, a former politician from South Carolina, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week. ""We buy at the World Food Program 50% of our grains from inside Ukraine. So you can imagine the impact it has on the World Food Program alone.”

The controversy over food security and the ideological significance of the war reflects the terms of geopolitical debate in Africa, where many impoverished countries depend upon Ukrainian food exports and also have a strong memory of Western European colonialism. Russian President Vladimir Putin played on that historic context ahead of Lavrov’s trip by arguing that the U.S. alliance network is “racist and neocolonial in its essence.”

Price countered by citing Putin’s statement following an event commemorating “Peter the Great: the Birth of the Empire” — that he is following Czar Peter’s example in trying to “return and reinforce” Russian control over the territory of modern Ukraine.

20220804,"Tehran, Aug 5 : A new round of talks on the revival of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers has began in Vienna after a 150-day hiatus, according to Iran's official news agency.

The Iranian negotiating team, headed by Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani, held a meeting with the Russian delegation led by Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna and chief negotiator to the Vienna talks, Xinhua news agency reported, citing IRNA.

""The two sides had a frank, pragmatic and constructive exchange of views on ways and means of overcoming the last outstanding issues,"" Ulyanov tweeted after the meeting.

Bagheri Kani also met with Enrique Mora, the European Union chief coordinator for the Iran nuclear talks, and Secretary General of the Austrian Foreign Ministry Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal respectively.

Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to curb its nuclear program in return for the removal of sanctions on the country. However, former US President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the agreement.

The talks on reviving the JCPOA began in April 2021 in the Austrian capital of Vienna but were suspended in March this year because of political differences between Tehran and Washington."
20220803,"Azerbaijan claimed on Wednesday, August 3, to have taken control of several positions and destroyed Armenian targets, killing three people.

""Control has been established on several important heights,"" including hills, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said in a statement, adding that its forces were fortifying those positions.

Earlier on Wednesday, both sides reported the deaths of at least two Armenian separatists and an Azerbaijani soldier in violence around Nagorno-Karabakh that raises the specter of a new war - after that of 2020.

These incidents are also likely to weigh on the peace talks that have been taking place for several months between Azerbaijan and Armenia, two rival ex-Soviet republics in the Caucasus, with the mediation of the European Union.

Russia, which sponsored the ceasefire that ended the 2020 war and deployed a peacekeeping force to Nagorno-Karabakh, has accused Azerbaijani forces of violating the truce in the area of Saribaba.

Moscow, which considers the Caucasus region as its backyard, is taking “measures to stabilize the situation,” the Russian Defense Ministry added in a statement.

The European Union, for its part, called for the ""immediate cessation of hostilities"".

""It is essential to de-escalate, to fully respect the ceasefire and to return to the negotiating table to seek negotiated solutions,"" said Peter Stano, the spokesman for the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, in a press release.

On Wednesday, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry announced the death of a conscript after ""heavy fire"" targeted an Azerbaijani army position in the Lachin district, a buffer zone between the Armenian border and Nagorno-Karabakh. .

Azerbaijan claimed to have carried out in retaliation an operation called ""Revenge"", during which ""several combat positions of illegal Armenian armed elements were destroyed"".

The Ministry of Defense published a video in which we see several explosions presented as being the result of strikes on the Armenian positions.

Two members of the Armenian separatist forces were killed and 14 wounded, authorities in the enclave said, denouncing a ""flagrant violation of the ceasefire"".

Faced with this situation, the Armenian Foreign Ministry urged the international community to take measures to stop ""Azerbaijan's aggressive attitude and actions"".

As a sign of the escalation of tensions, the leader of the Nagorno-Karabakh separatists, Arayik Haroutiounian, signed a decree on Wednesday proclaiming a partial military mobilization in this territory, according to the presidency website.

After a first war that killed more than 30,000 people in the early 1990s, Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed again in the fall of 2020 for control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region which, supported by Yerevan had seceded from Azerbaijan.

More than 6,500 people were killed in this new war lost by Armenia.

As part of a ceasefire agreement brokered by Moscow, which has deployed peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, Yerevan ceded significant territory to Azerbaijan.

This agreement was experienced as a humiliation in Armenia, where several opposition parties have since demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian – whom they accuse of having made too many concessions to Baku.

>> Armenia: the Azerbaijani threat to the borders

Despite a timid diplomatic relaxation between Armenia and Azerbaijan, tensions remain strong between the two former Soviet republics.

Both countries regularly report outbreaks of violence and casualties among soldiers.

Under EU mediation, the two countries are conducting negotiations to reach a peace treaty.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev held talks in Brussels in April and May with Nikol Pashinian.

According to the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, the two leaders could meet again this summer.

The foreign ministers of the two countries also met last month in Georgia for their first direct talks since the end of the 2020 war.

The summary of the

France 24 week invites you to come back to the news that marked the week

Take international news everywhere with you!"
20220803,
20220809,"That would be sufficient for 1980 when the U.S. produced 5 billion bushels per year, with enough left over for a few hundred million bushels to be exported. But that is far from acceptable in 2022 when it will take 15 billion bushels of corn to meet the 2.5 billion bushel export demand.

Of course, Champaign, Vermilion and Douglas county farmers say Mother Nature was not kind to them this year, and rains never came. So, while 150 bushels per acre is going to make it hard to pay for fertilizer for the 2023 crop, they did the best that the weather allowed. And ironically, 150 bushels may be a bumper crop in another part of the world where weather is usually not an issue.

Not everyone may have followed what has been happening in Europe. International news sources have frequently reported record heat of more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit across much of Europe this summer. But along with that has also been a shortage of precipitation. France is a major international corn producer and in the past month over 90% of that nation has had less than 25% of typical moisture.

The Matif grain exchange in Paris reports corn prices are at record high levels, primarily because farmers are not selling. It is likely that corn sales have diminished, not because farmers are looking for higher prices, but more so because they may not have any corn to sell.

France’s corn crop probably will drop 19% this year because of the hot, dry weather, the Agriculture Ministry said Friday. The crisis is “a tragedy for our farmers, our ecosystems and for biodiversity,” according to the prime minister’s statement. Weather forecasts suggest the drought could last another two weeks and become “even more concerning,” officials said. The country just had its driest July in decades.

And what is happening with great irony, is that the first shiploads of corn coming from Ukrainian ports that have been blocked by Russia are headed for ports in the European Union. Instead of hauling wheat across the mine-laden Black Sea to African and Middle Eastern ports where millions of people are reported starving because of the Russian invasion, Ukrainian corn is headed to England and Ireland.

Other ships are hauling sunflower meal to China and sunflower oil to Italy. And there is some corn headed for Turkey. But there are no reports of grain headed to Middle Eastern or African ports. It is likely a case of nations that have the most money are getting the early grain shipments.

Those farmers in east central Illinois, where drought has been steady throughout the growing season, continue to hope for rain that will fill out corn kernels and soybean pods, and will have to depend on Ukrainian farmers to fill the export demand. Crop insurance indemnities will be their lifeline to 2023."
20220812,"After Russia invaded Ukraine last February, the European Union moved to block RT and Sputnik, two of the Kremlin's top channels for spreading propaganda and misinformation about the war.

Nearly six months later, the number of sites pushing that same content has exploded as Russia found ways to evade the ban. They've rebranded their work to disguise it. They've shifted some propaganda duties to diplomats. And they've cut and pasted much of the content on new websites — ones that until now had no obvious ties to Russia.

NewsGuard, a New York-based firm that studies and tracks online misinformation, has now identified 250 websites actively spreading Russian disinformation about the war, with dozens of new ones added in recent months.

Claims on these sites include allegations that Ukraine's army has staged some deadly Russian attacks to curry global support, that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is faking public appearances, or that Ukrainian refugees are committing crimes in Germany and Poland.

Some of the sites pose as independent think tanks or news outlets. About half are English-language, while others are in French, German or Italian. Many were set up long before the war and were not obviously tied to the Russian government until they suddenly began parroting Kremlin talking points.

“They may be establishing sleeper sites,” said NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz. Sleeper sites are websites created for a disinformation campaign that lay largely dormant, slowly building an audience through innocuous or unrelated posts, and then switching to propaganda or disinformation at an appointed time.

While NewsGuard's analysis found that much of the disinformation about the war in Ukraine is coming from Russia, it did find instances of false claims with a pro-Ukrainian bent. They included claims about a hotshot fighter ace known as the Ghost of Kyiv that officials later admitted was a myth.

YouTube, TikTok and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, all pledged to remove RT and Sputnik from their platforms within the European Union. But researchers have found that in some cases all Russia had to do to evade the ban was to post it from a different account.

The Disinformation Situation Center, a Europe-based coalition of disinformation researchers, found that some RT video content was showing up on social media under a new brand name and logo. In the case of some video footage, the RT brand was simply removed from the video and reposted on a new YouTube channel not covered by the EU's ban.

More aggressive content moderation of social media could make it harder for Russia to circumvent the ban, according to Felix Kartte, a senior adviser at Reset, a U.K.-based nonprofit that has funded the Disinformation Situation Center's work and is critical of social media’s role in democratic discourse.

""Rather than putting effective content moderation systems in place, they are playing whack-a-mole with the Kremlin’s disinformation apparatus,” Kartte said.

YouTube's parent company did not immediately respond to questions seeking comment about the ban.

In the EU, officials are trying to shore up their defenses. This spring the EU approved legislation that would require tech companies to do more to root out disinformation. Companies that fail could face big fines.

European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova last month called disinformation “a growing problem in the EU, and we really have to take stronger measures.”

The proliferation of sites spreading disinformation about the war in Ukraine shows that Russia had a plan in case governments or tech companies tried to restrict RT and Sputnik. That means Western leaders and tech companies will have to do more than shutter one or two websites if they hope to stop the flow of Kremlin disinformation.

“The Russians are a lot smarter,” said NewsGuard's other co-CEO, Steven Brill.

SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THIS SITE, WE'VE BEEN EXPOSING THE US DISINFORMATION ABOUT ITS ACTIONSAND INTENT. THE CIA AND THE PENTAGON RUN THE SHOW... WE HAVE NO TIES WITH RUSSIA, BUT WE TRY TO HAVE PROPER TIES WITH THE TRUTH. IF THE US DID NOT FEAR THE TRUTH, JULIAN ASSANGE WOULD BE FREE.
