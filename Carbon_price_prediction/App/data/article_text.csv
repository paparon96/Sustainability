1142644245,20231127,"Sri Lanka’s economy has contracted every year since 2019, but exports to the European Union have increased, providing vital income in desperate economic times. This has largely been due to the EU’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+), which grants Sri Lanka tariff-free access to the EU market so long as it complies with core human rights and labour rights treaties.



 But, as the EU noted in a new report, the Sri Lankan Government is falling well short of the mark.

The report identifies two bright spots for human rights in Sri Lanka: the ‘resilience’ of civil society; and the 2022 Aragalaya (struggle in Sinhala) movement in which thousands protested for good governance ‘in the spirit of democracy and freedom of expression and assembly.’



 Yet the report makes clear that civil society’s ‘resilience’ is necessary in the face of Government ‘harassment and intimidation.’ 



 Since President Ranil Wickremesinghe took office in July 2022, the government has adopted a ‘repressive response’ to protests, arresting the movement’s leaders and employing ‘disproportionate use of force.’



 This challenges the EU’s policy to assist Sri Lanka’s recovery from its economic, governance and human rights crises. As the report states, “The process of reform will be more sustainable and robust if Sri Lankan civil society is part of it and if the approach is truly inclusive.”



 Notably, the Government has yet to repeal the abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act, a key commitment to the EU, and even broke a moratorium on its use. As the International Monetary Fund noted in September, civil society’s ‘oversight and monitoring’ of government actions is “restricted … by broad application of counter-terrorism rules.”



 Instead, the Government has proposed new counterterrorism legislation that does not meet rights standards, and an Online Safety Bill that the EU says “could lead to censorship.” Other rights concerns the EU highlighted include the “treatment of minorities, hate crimes, allegations of torture, decriminalising same sex relations, domestic violence and child abuse and harassment and threats against human rights defenders, lawyers and journalists.”



 These and other developments are incompatible with the GSP+ human rights requirements, and yet Sri Lanka’s government continues to benefit from the program. For conditionality to be credible, the GSP regulation needs to be reformed to require clear, public, and time bound benchmarks for compliance. This is what EU lawmakers should focus on: making GSP more effective in fostering human rights progress in beneficiary countries."
1142652461,20231127,"Sierra Leone's government said it was in full control on Sunday evening after reporting an attack at a military armoury in the capital Freetown that sparked armed clashes, which the president called an attempt to destabilise the state.

Authorities in the English-speaking West African country -- which has been going through a political crisis following elections in June this year -- have declared a national curfew until further notice.

President Julius Maada Bio said late Sunday that calm had been restored after what he described as an attempt to undermine peace and stability in the country.

""Most of the leaders have been arrested. Security operations and investigations are ongoing,"" Bio said on national television, adding that the government would ""ensure that those responsible are held accountable"".

An AFP journalist said calm was slowly returning to the capital by Sunday evening, but checkpoints heavily guarded by security forces remained in place.

The ""government is in firm control of the security situation in Freetown, the attackers are retreating,"" information minister Chernor Bah earlier told AFP.

Videos posted on social media appeared to show men in uniform under arrest in the back or beside a military pick-up truck.

Earlier in the day, witnesses told AFP they heard gunshots and explosions in the city's Wilberforce district, where the armoury and some embassies are located.

Other witnesses reported exchanges of fire near a barracks in Murray Town district, home to the navy, and outside another military site in Freetown.

The information ministry reported attacks on prisons earlier in the day that obliged the security forces to retreat.

""The prisons were thus overrun"" with some detainees released and others ""abducted"", it said.

Video posted on social networks suggested numerous prisoners had escaped from the central jail.

One man who was in a group filmed on the street by an AFP correspondent said they had escaped from the prison.

The information ministry said security forces had pushed the attackers to the outskirts of Freetown, with drone video taken by AFP showing empty streets in the capital.

The situation remained unclear with the authorities making no comments on the motives or identity of the attackers.

President Bio wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the government would ""continue to protect the peace and security of Sierra Leone against the forces that wish to truncate our much-cherished stability"".

""We remain resolute in our determination to protect democracy in Sierra Leone.""

Regional bloc the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which has contended with a series of coups among its members since 2020, issued a statement underlining ""its zero-tolerance for unconstitutional change of government"".

Echoing language used to condemn past coup attempts, ECOWAS spoke of its ""utter disgust"" over a ""plot by certain individuals to acquire arms and disturb the peace and constitutional order"".

The US embassy condemned on social media the bid to break into the armoury and offered continued support for those ""working for a peaceful, democratic, healthy and prosperous Sierra Leone"".

The European Union's local representation expressed concern and called for the respect of constitutional order.

Witness Susan Kargbo told AFP by telephone she was woken ""by a loud sound of heavy machine gun (fire) and bombs coming from the Wilberforce barracks around 4:30 am.

""I was shocked and... the gunshots continued until this morning, it was like a war,"" she said.

The government said those attempting to break into the armoury had been repelled but asked the public to stay at home while security operations continued.

The local representations of the UK and the European Union echoed the authorities' advice to stay at home.

The civil aviation authority said Sierra Leone's airspace remained open but asked airlines to reschedule their flights after the lifting of the curfew.

President Bio, who was first elected in 2018, was re-elected in June with 56.17 percent of the vote -- just over the 55 percent needed to avoid a run-off.

International observers condemned inconsistencies and a lack of transparency in the count, as well as acts of violence and intimidation.

The main opposition All People's Congress (APC) party disputed the results of the presidential, legislative and local elections on June 24 and boycotted all levels of government.

The APC and the government signed an agreement in October following talks mediated by the Commonwealth, the African Union and ECOWAS.

The APC agreed to end its boycott and begin participating in government in exchange for an end to detentions and court cases it said were politically motivated."

1142654806,20231127,"THESE days, when a Senegalese fisherman climbs into a canoe, it’s likely to be the last time – either he is leaving his life behind in hope of a new one in Europe, or failing in the attempt.

Small-scale fishing has long been a mainstay of Senegal’s economy and its communities along the Atlantic coast, but over-fishing, industrial competition and the impacts of climate change are taking their toll.

“These young guys behind me, when we’re at sea all they talk about is going to Europe,” said Ibrahima Diouf, a solidly-built fisherman in his 40s, pointing to the six crew members getting his boat ready in Thiaroye, outside the capital Dakar.

He pointed to a dozen other boats lying on the beach, saying they’d been abandoned by colleagues who left for Europe “because there are not enough fish, they can no longer make a living”.

In recent years, thousands of Senegalese have embarked in the narrow wooden canoes, some reaching 20m long, and carrying dozens of passengers paying several hundreds of dollars each to traffickers.

It’s a huge price for a dangerous trip of 1,500km and over a week toward the Canary Islands of Spain, their gateway to the European Union.

Nearly every day in cities and towns across Senegal, people hear about a successful venture, a boat stopped by coastguard interceptions – or capsized ships.

But that has not deterred a growing number of fishermen to join the ranks of those hoping to leave, usually young people fleeing poverty and unemployment.

“Today you also have women and children, and people with jobs. Fishermen are the new ones,” said Boubacar Seye, president of the migrant NGO Horizons Without Borders.

“Almost everyone here has left,” said Ababacar Diop, a married father of two in his 30s, who himself tried to make the crossing but was picked up and returned by Senegal’s navy in October.

“We’ve gotten used to coming back empty-handed” from fishing trips, he said, blaming the lost catches on “these trawlers behind me”.

At anchor are dozens of hulking fishing boats, some with Senegalese flags, many others with foreign flags.

Most are hauling in hake, sole, shrimp or octopus mainly to meet the demands of European consumers, or to supply fishmeal or oil producers, the Environmental Justice Foundation said in a recent report.

“A few years ago, we would set out at 6am and return around 5 or 6pm,” Diop said. “These days, we’re forced to return at 10 or 11am” because there’s nothing to catch.

Fishing provides around 600,000 direct and indirect jobs for Senegal and 3.2% of its GDP, according to a 2022 report from the US Department of Agriculture.

But for the tens of thousands still trying to catch sardinelle, mackerel or scad, “heading out to fish is a losing proposition”, said Aliou Ba, head of ocean campaigns for Greenpeace Africa.

“This craft is dying,” he said.

Senegal’s fishing exports nearly quadrupled between 2008 and 2018, according to the Environmental Justice Foundation, even though more than half the stocks of species in nearby waters are facing “collapse”.

Meanwhile, catches by small-scale fishermen in canoes plunged by 58% from 2012 to 2019.

The diminished prospects help explain why Senegalese are now alongside Moroccans as the most numerous migrants to reach the Canary Islands this year, according to Spanish NGOs and the EU’s Frontex border agency.

AFP could not obtain overall statistics on the migrant numbers, nor the number of Senegalese intercepted on the Canary Islands route.

But most that AFP reporters spoke with on the islands in mid-October said they were fishermen or from a family of fishers, or from towns along Senegal’s coast.

Senegal’s navy said in late October that it had intercepted 26 canoes carrying a total of 3,800 migrants in just two weeks, Senegalese but also people from Gambia, Guinea or Mali.

An official at the Spanish embassy in Senegal acknowledged that “the arrival of fishermen is a new factor” with regards to the canoes landing on the southernmost Canary Island of El Hierro.

Dozens of Senegalese have drowned on the route that has seen 633 deaths overall this year, according to the International Organisation for Migration.

For Ba at Greenpeace, more fishermen are leaving for the simple reason that they have the means to do so.

“If the fishermen decided they weren’t going to leave, nobody would be able to leave,” he said.

But for those like Diop, whose first attempt was thwarted, a chance to leave for Europe is too tempting to refuse.

“If I had a little bit of hope in fishing, I would never have tried to reach Spain by canoe,” he said. — AFP"

1142662207,20231127,"What is coming next, and what is the price for the loss of more than 15,000 martyrs?

Who will pay the price for the devastation during 50 days of brutal aggression against the civilians of Gaza?

Does the West see the temporary truce as a way out of its ethical crisis in backing barbarian-like assaults?

These questions remain, alongside the most vital, what is a suitable scenario on the day after the expiry of this temporary truce?

I raise all these questions to US President Joe Biden, as well as to all the other leaders in his alliance. I emphasise that this truce must not be ‘breathing space’ before Israel resumes its brutal attacks, nor should it be a way for war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu to falsely claim a ‘victory’ on behalf of the hostages’ families, who have themselves exerted tremendous pressure inside Israel.

The Palestinian Cause cannot just be confined to Gaza.

This temporary truce should provide a good opportunity to review the past and work towards reaching a lasting solution that will preclude the eruption of hostilities again.

Establishing an independent Palestinian State is the only way to resolve this unequal conflict.

The Western world, which has participated with Israel in committing massacres against innocent Palestinians, should seek forgiveness for the bloodshed of innocent people who have lost their lives because the Zionist prime minister, with their consensus, has wreaked havoc and created a bloodbath based on what are false claims of ‘self-defence’.

Everyone must realise that the events taking place in Gaza have shown that Netanyahu’s policy of increasing the pressure on the Palestinians has failed to provide security for Israel and that continuing these practices will lead to the renewed eruption of violence, possibly on a greater scale than before.

We must all accept that the continued occupation together with the deprivation of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians could lead to a huge explosion at any time.

The West should realise that the global community is going through a difficult cultural, political, economic and military crisis affecting all of civilisation and which could be the precursor of more conflicts, not only in the Middle East arenas, but also in various parts of the globe.

Last week, we received at the GDN’s sister Arabic newspaper, Akhbar Al Khaleej offices, the German Ambassador to Bahrain Clemens Hach, and German Foreign Ministry spokesman to the Middle East and North Africa Dr Dennis Kumetat. A lengthy discussion session was held on the Palestinian Cause, specifically on the events taking place in Gaza.

To be fair, as two Westerners, they were fully aware of the events and background to the Palestinian Cause in general. Their opinion was that a two-state solution, with concessions from both sides, based on the geographical boundaries prior to 1967 remains the only possible solution to ensure a future war-free Middle East.

Having also personally witnessed the events of 1967, we all believed that the solution to the problem has to be based on the United Nations Security Council Resolution No 242 which coincided with the ceasefire of the same year.

Israel, however, does not take into account UN resolutions that have been passed throughout the Arab-Israeli conflict because the West has been hesitant in imposing them. As a result, Tel Aviv has continued building colonial settlements and occupying Palestinian territories by force year-after-year and continues to do so.

The concern is, what confidence do we have that the two-state solution could be taken seriously this time?

We have several concerns, which we would like to raise with the countries of the West, particularly the United Kingdom, France and Germany, who are key players in resolving a two-state solution.

Will they be able to protect the Palestinian state from the evils and greed of Israel?

Will they be ready to punish Israel in case of their possible attempt to evade the two-state solution or will blame, once again, be placed on the Arabs and Palestinians?

Unfortunately, speaking frankly, there is little trust in the four states that are supposedly supporting a two-state solution. To date they have ignored the collective attempts by the Foreign Ministers of the countries of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation who have visited the veto-holding Security Council countries of China, Russia, United Kingdom, France and the US in a bid to urge them to adopt a fairer stance towards the Palestinian Cause.

The Arab World and their governments, especially those with close ties to Western countries, must unite in their demand for the adoption of an independent Palestinian State.

We firmly believe that ending the Palestinian dilemma will not just be a triumph and a fair deal for its citizens but will also be of significant strategic interest for all Arab countries, helping the region avert any terrorist attacks that could emanate from failing to establish the rights of the Palestinians.

Arab countries should also appreciate that new generations are being educated in all areas of knowledge and that one day they will be the new leaders. Today, we have seen Hamas, who despite the Israeli blockage, launch military style attacks that have shaken to the core one of the most technologically-advanced armies. Just imagine what these generations, with their more advanced technical knowledge, could achieve if the unfair conditions in Palestine were to continue.

We now address the Israelis themselves, particularly those who are considered to be moderate.

I say to them that it is not in the interest of Israel to allow someone such as Netanyahu to rule them because this criminal with his heinous crimes can be compared to the Nazis - who distorted the image of the German people in the West, which even today, leads some people to unfairly label all Germans as Nazi sympathisers.

Yitzhak Rabin, who assumed the role of President of Israel and was himself a military man, was perhaps the last Israeli politician calling for peace and understanding, but he was assassinated by fanatics in Israel.

After Rabin, no government official has emerged from Israel talking peace. And again, just imagine …the young man who killed Rabin was another Jewish immigrant who came from Yemen.

Today, Israel continues to bring in thousands of settlers who are provided with arms and can be considered extremely dangerous.

Speaking to the Israeli nation. If you show mercy to the Palestinians, you show mercy to yourselves, because there will never be a statute of limitations on the Palestinian.

On the contrary, their cause will grow bigger and Palestinian resistance will become much stronger. The Palestinian cause will continue to win global sympathy from people near and far as you will have noticed in the past few weeks.

Today, more than 95 per cent of the global public opinion supports freedom for Palestine, but Netanyahu supports revenge … not peace. The question is revenge against whom?

Since 1948, Israel has murdered more than 100,000 Palestinians. During the past few weeks, the Israeli military machinery killed around 15,000, most of whom were women and children.

These bloodbaths will not lead to peace. Peace needs brave people who are determined to stop the bloodshed of innocent souls, but unfortunately no brave man has until now emerged from Israel.

The West must pave the way to allow voices calling for peace. It must not fear Israeli terrorism and must heed every voice that calls for a fair peace.

What happens now is a reflection of Jewish behaviour with protesters.

The Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez gave a statement a few days ago in front of the Rafah Border Crossing where he said that it’s time for the global community and the European Union to recognise the Palestinian state.

He continued that if the European Union did not acknowledge the Palestinian state, Spain would do so by taking the decision by itself.

We found the women and child killer Netanyahu condemning the Spanish statements. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen summoned the ambassadors of Spain and Belgium in Tel Aviv and rebuked them harshly.

The Zionist frenzy against each and every voice advocating humanity reminds us of the practices of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), America’s pro-Israel lobby, that has become the spearhead of Israeli terrorism against all moderate voices which advocate for Palestinian rights.

It exerts tremendous pressure and spends millions of dollars to ensure that opposition against Israel’s policies inside the US congress remains muted.

What Rashida Tlaib, the US politician who has Palestinian roots, has done is totally acceptable when she registered her rejection against the unconditional support for Israel in its war against Gaza.

Progressive US Congressman Mark Pocan pulled no punches in an interview, addressing his ongoing feud with AIPAC, the influential lobby group described as a ‘fervent supporter of Israel’s bloody bombardment of Gaza and a top contributor to the campaign coffers of Democrats and Republicans alike’.

He told politics writer Alexander Sammon: “I think they’re a cancerous presence on our democracy and politics in general, and if I can be a surgeon, that’s great.”

This statement reflects the amount of influential pressure now exerted on US decision making, which is still considered a compass for Western resolutions.

We should all be cautious that the absence of peace will result in nothing but animosity and violence, as we saw when Former Obama Administration Official Stuart Seldowitz attacked an Egyptian food seller in New York, while spouting words against Islam and Palestine.

This is a serious matter. It should alert us to real dangers and obstacles that come from some Western minds that can push the world into violence and extremism, especially in the absence of peace and our inability to stop the murder of innocent Palestinians by the Israeli killing machine."
1142657384,20231127,"Jamaica Labour Party leader Andrew Holness at the party's 80th annual conference being held at the National Arena.

KINGSTON, Jamaica - Prime Minister Andrew Holness has said that the trade and economic opportunities presented by the Samoa Agreement will be beneficial for Jamaica.

But, he also said stakeholders must be assured that there is nothing in the Treaty that will contravene Jamaican law. Holness spoke to the issue on Sunday as he addressed the Jamaica Labour Party’s 80th annual conference at the National Arena.

Jamaica, at the last minute, did not sign the document on November 15, at the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)-EU Ministerial meeting in Samoa.

The decision not to sign was made after the local Christian group, Jamaica Coalition for a Healthy Society (JCHS), raised concerns that by signing the document, which it described as a ""comprehensive new binding 20-year agreement with the European Union (EU),” it would reintroduce the rejected Comprehensive Sexuality Education Curriculum back into Jamaican classrooms and undermine Jamaicans' fundamental rights and freedoms.""

JCHS said the government was proceeding to sign despite strong pushback from several local citizens' groups to what has been described as ""the glaring danger of multiple clauses"" in the agreement.

""The agreement will bind Jamaica to undefined human rights obligations tied to trade sanctions, reintroduce comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) back into schools despite parents' outrage in 2012 with regards to CSE's sexualising content; trap the nation in yet-to-be-negotiated international instruments, and demand the acceptance of terms that directly threaten citizens' freedom of conscience and speech among other alarming concerns,"" JCHS said in a statement.

On Sunday, Holness said “as we pursue these opportunities, we must engage, explain and reassure our stakeholders of the various provisions in place to respect our values and laws as a sovereign country.”

He said Jamaica continues to be a reasonable and rational voice in international affairs.

Said the prime minister:“We continue to lead in global initiatives and treaties, whether in trade, finance or climate change. Whatever treaty obligations we negotiate or sign on to, it must be consistent with our laws and constitution and we must engage with local stakeholders within our democratic framework.”

Holness said this has been the approach of his government, “even as it is we’re determined and committed to ensure that our local financial system is robustly compliant with the international financial system, Financial Action Taskforce recommendations for anti-money laundering and other illicit activities.”

The prime minister said he wants Jamaica’s financial system to meet the highest international standards “as we believe that this will make Jamaica a stronger and safer destination for investment. So it is with the Samoa Treaty.”

While the EU representative in Jamaica has expressed surprise that Jamaica did not sign, Holness said Foreign Affairs Minister, Kamina Johnson Smith has already started the process of engaging stakeholders on the matter.

The Samoa Agreement, named for the tiny Polynesian island where the official signing took place, is the new European Union/Africa Caribbean Pacific (EU/ACP) Partnership Agreement. It replaces the Cotonou Agreement that expired in 2020. Countries will not derive benefit until they sign the agreement."

The EU's gesture is in furtherance of the implementation of the Savanna Integrated Biodiversity Conservation Initiative (SIBCI), and the CITES Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKES) projects, which are funded by the EU.

The SIBCI projectinitiated by the Ghana Wildlife Society and partners, seeks to support the implementation of sustainable management of the Mole National Park, while the CITES MIKES project monitors trends in levels of illegal killing of elephants and build capacity in protected areas spread across the range.

Mr Irchard Razaaly, EU Ambassador to Ghana, who visited the Mole National Park, and the ranger camp site to hand over the equipment as well as inaugurate the camp site in the West Gonja Municipality of the Savannah Region, said the gesture was to promote and improve the livelihoods of communities surrounding the Park.

He expressed delight that the SIBCI, and CITES MIKES projects were helping to preserve the Mole National Park for future generations, and the livelihoods of the people in the area.

The Mole National Park is the largest protected area in the country with a size of 4,577km2 and the most prestigious of all the National Parks in the country.

The Park, which is one of the prime sites for biodiversity conservation in the country, was established in the late 1950s as a wildlife reserve and gazetted as a National Park in 1971.

It is endowed with various species of animals such as the elephant, buffalo, roan antelope, leopard, kob and warthog, among others.

However, the Park is surrounded by over 33 communities, and the communities' dependence on the wildlife resource without replenishing to meet socio-economic needs has gradually led to significant decline of the resources in the area hence the projects and the EU's support to the Park to stem the tide.

Mr Iddrisu Musah, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Forestry Commission, said the support from the EU had been timely and helpful in stemming the precipitous decline in the protection of the natural resources and providing much needed respite for communities in terms of livelihood options.

Mr Musah said, ""The EU's support for the management of the Mole National Park and its neighbouring areas through innovative projects such as the MIKE project and the SIBCI project have ensured that protected areas like Mole National Park and the unique array of biodiversity that they contain can continue to thrive, now and in future.""

He called on all stakeholders to continue to support efforts at conserving the Park, and urged the Park Authority to continue to work with partners to scale up the development of the Park and ensure it became a beacon that could catalyse great socio-economic development for the neighbouring communities, districts and the nation as a whole.

Mr Richard Appoh, Director of Conservation Programmes, Ghana Wildlife Society, said to further integrate conservation into farming practices, the SIBCI project distributed 4,200 improved mango seedlings to farmers, thus encouraging the incorporation of sustainable agricultural practices into their farming systems.

He said the project had also trained 30 law enforcement officers to combat the threats of poaching and illegal activities within the Park.

Mr Karim Musah Kusubari, West Gonja Municipal Chief Executive, expressed gratitude to the EU for supporting the projects in the area, and said they meant a lot for the people and communities in the area.

A representative of the Overlord of the Gonja Traditional Area thanked the partners for the projects and assured them of the traditional authority's commitment for the success of the projects.

Mr Razaaly later inspected a viewing tower constructed under the SIBCI project to help in both ecotourism and Park surveillance.

He again visited the Murugu community in the area to interact with the 300 women trained in sustainable shea picking and processing as part of the project, as well as inspected their shea processing facility."
1142666463,20231127,"From our Bureau of Ultimate Chutzpah with some assistance from our Bureau of Monstrously Big Lies

According to EU human rights envoy Eamon Gilmore, Castro, Inc. steadfastly claims that there are zero political prisoners in its dungeons.

Yes, you betcha. All of those imprisoned for protesting on July 11, 2021, are common criminals who pose a severe threat to Cuban society. And all of them are being treated very well by prison authorities.

So, keep repeating this mantra over and over: There are no political prisoners in Cuba, there are no political prisoners in Cuba, there are no political prisoners in Cuba . . . After a while, you will believe this to be true.

Testimonies from relatives of political prisoners and members of civil society confirm what many Cubans doubted, given the lack of photos and publications: the representative of the European Union (EU) for human rights, Eamon Gilmore, met with loved ones of several prisoners and with activists. “He told us that he had met with the authorities, with the Prosecutor’s Office, with the Supreme Court, with the Council of State, always advocating for political prisoners,” Yinda Elizastigui, who this Saturday went on strike, told DIARIO DE CUBA. hunger to demand the release of his son Luis Robles. The young man was sentenced to five years in prison for peacefully calling for an end to repression in Cuba with a sign on the street. His mother said she felt “completely distressed” by what the EU human rights representative told them. The regime’s response to Gilmore’s questions was to deny that any Cuban was imprisoned for political reasons. “They told him that these people were imprisoned, but not for political reasons, that they had all the medical attention they needed and that they had never been mistreated. Lies, lies and lies,” said Elizastigui."
1142672619,20231127,"Contrary to popular myth, Britain does have a constitution. Unlike the American one, it’s not written down in one place. But Britain has Magna Carta, the 1628 Petition of Right, and the 1689 Bill of Rights. It also has centuries of precedent governing how business in Parliament is to be done.

And Brexit’s opponents are trashing that constitution.

Joining the European Union was the first assault on Britain’s constitution. It meant that, by vote of Parliament, Parliament itself was no longer supreme. In days gone by, Parliament had installed and executed monarchs, funded wars and given the working class and women the vote.

But after 1973, and increasingly thereafter, Parliament’s ability to make the rules that govern Britain shrank steadily. Having been brought up on a tradition of powerful and representative parliamentary government, the British people were always uncomfortable with this new reality.

That, more than anything else, was what shaped the outcome of the Brexit Referendum in 2016. As Sir Michael Caine put in in 2017, he voted for Brexit because he would rather be a “poor master than a rich servant.”

By 2016, the referendum itself was a well-established part of the British system. Every major party had promised, or even demanded, a referendum on Britain’s EU membership over the past decade.

Prior to 2016, there had been referenda on membership of the EU’s predecessor in 1975, Scottish and Welsh local government, Britain’s voting system, on whether northern England should have a regional assembly, and on Scottish independence.

These referenda were hard-fought, and their results were always respected.

Not so the Brexit Referendum. Despite Leave’s victory and the fact that in the election of 2017, 85 percent of the British public voted for a party that explicitly pledged to back Brexit, a near-majority of MPs still hanker to remain in the EU’s customs union.

To achieve this, they have tried every trick in the book. They have sued to frustrate the result of the referendum — and the courts have complied. The British civil service is supposed to be non-partisan, but anonymous civil servants repeatedly complain that their colleagues are on side with Remain.

After the House of Commons refused to pass Prime Minister Theresa May’s terrible deal (one that would ensure Britain keeps taking its rules from Brussels), Mrs. May and the EU changed Brexit’s effective date from March 29 to April 12.

Like the man with the broom following the elephants, the Commons was called in afterward to validate this change — but only to make British law comply with what was now purportedly international law.

The implication is that, no matter how often the Commons votes to leave the EU, it can simply be overridden by the EU’s supposedly higher power. This makes a mockery of EU’s own rules — but the EUis only interested in following its rules when they work in Brussels’ favor.

At the core of the British Constitution is the relationship between the Commons and the government. The Cabinet is governed by “collective responsibility,” meaning the policy the Cabinet adopts is binding on all of it. Members of Parliament, in turn, question the government and can become ministers.

But with Remain at the helm, collective responsibility has broken down, with ministers repeatedly voting against the government. So many of them have resigned that entire government departments are vacant. Nor do new potential ministers want to sign on to a government that smells like death.

Speaker of the House John Bercow is supposed to be non-partisan. But while his decisions have randomly favored first Remain and then Brexit, most of his throws of the dice have come up EU-blue.

Mr. Bercow’s justification? If Parliament was guided only by precedent, then “nothing ever would change.” Nonsense. There is clearly a way to change the British system: Win an election, command a majority in the Commons and vote your policy through. Bringing change to a game isn’t the referee’s job.

But the worst of Remain’s follies was the endorsement by the Commons of a Remainder motion last week to take control of the Parliamentary timetable.

This is a terrible departure from precedent. As Professor Vernon Bogdanor, an authority on the British Constitution, noted, it would be “unconstitutional for parliament to take over the Commons timetable to impose an alternative form of Brexit.”

The Commons can either support the government or change it: It cannot do the government’s job for it. In the end, the votes after the Remain motion came to nothing. But it throws every future British treaty and spending bill into doubt by asserting that the Commons is a co-equal actor with the government.

Brexit won in 2016 because it embodied a popular sense that Britain needed to take back control. The Remain establishment hates this. They have a clear goal: Keep Britain in the EU.

And then sit back and applaud as the EU trashes the British Constitution some more."

The data, made available to the Ghanaian Times in an exclusive interview, shows that they returned from more than 30 European and African countries primarily Libya, Niger, Burkina Faso, Morocco and Algeria.

Their arrival was facilitated under the European Union (EU) -IOM Joint Initiative (JI) for Migrant Protection and Reintegration Programme in collaboration with government agencies.



 Last year, 1,050 returnees arrived via char­tered flights and as of October this year, 460 followed with more expected to join them later.

Commenting on the development, a Rein­tegration Assistant of IOM Ghana, Victoria Adomako said beyond the data more people have been supported to return home under other voluntary programmes.

She said Bono towns including Techiman, and others in Bono East Region, witnessed a substantial influx of returnees, followed by Ashanti where returnees went to towns like Aboaso, Mamponten, Ejura, and Aboabo.

In Greater Accra, she said areas like Nima, Ashaiman, and Madina and Kasoa in the Cen­tral Region experience significant numbers of returning individuals while there are increas­ing returns to the Northern and Western parts of the country.

She said the returned who often reach out to IOM in their countries of destina­tion come home due to unfulfilled dreams, conflicts and other factors which had left a diverse impact on them, including trauma and regret.

“For returns from JIs, we have a lot of Ghanaians returning with mental issues be­cause of the trauma they have been through in their migration journeys. We have trained clinical psychologists and therapists who provide services to them,” she said.

Ms Adomako explained that under the IOM’s comprehensive initiatives, pre-depar­ture counseling, economic, social, and psychosocial support were provided and they are equipped with the necessary tools for success­ful reintegration, including skill development, educa­tion for children, and social support.

She said the IOM had partnerships with state agencies Youth Employment Authori­ty, and the Ghana Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Commission who help to support the returnees to set up in the agriculture, trade and other areas de­pending on their interests and skills acquired during their sojourn.

“We give social support and education for the children and minors,” she said.

On challenges, Ms Adomako mentioned the stigmatisation of returnees and obstacles in accessing healthcare after they arrive home; the absence of a common platform for data effective policy implementation and deci­sion-making.

She advocated a comprehensive govern­ment involvement, while skills development and entrepreneurship drive should be in­creased to address unemployment, one of the key reasons for the migration.

For his part, an IOM Ghana Reintegration and Community Outreach Assistant, Collins Yeboah said some of the returnees travel using regular channels, but overstayed and ended up in irregular situations.

He said the IOM Ghana had intensified awareness creation at Schools and in commu­nities while it had created an information por­tal (IOM X/Waka Well) to provide accurate travel information to the public.

He said IOM was not against migration because it had socio-economic benefits, but it would encourage the public to embark on safe and orderly migration."
1142688032,20231127,"A senior Volkswagen executive involved in a global cost-cutting strategy said on Friday he was ""very worried"" about the future of the company's operations in South Africa, which is fighting persistent power cuts and logistics snarls.

The company's VW passenger car brand is in the midst of defining the key measures of a global scheme to boost its flagging margin - the first of a series of savings drives aimed at improving group profitability and staying competitive in the transition to electric cars.

The German automaker has been in South Africa for nearly 80 years. Factors like competitive labour costs once placed it among the company's higher-ranking bases globally, VW brand chief Thomas Schaefer said during a visit to the country.

But the costs of mitigating power outages caused by chronic production shortfalls at State-owned utility Eskom as well as rising labour costs and logjams on railways and at ports have eroded that advantage, he said.

""Eventually you have to say, why are we building cars in a less competitive factory somewhere far away from the real market where the consumption is?"" Schaefer said. ""I'm very worried about it ... We're not in the business of charity.""

He said the company's team in South Africa had done what it could to overcome what he called an ""uphill battle"" but that ultimately the South African government needed to step up to solve the problems.

Volkswagen produced some 132 200 Polo and Vivo models at its South African facility in Uitenhage last year, most of them for export.

Those export markets now risk disappearing, however, as wealthy countries move to electric vehicles (EVs).

The European Union and Britain are planning to ban sales of new internal combustion vehicles from 2035.

Schaefer said there were no current plans to introduce EV manufacturing in South Africa, since electric cars are currently priced out of the reach of most domestic consumers. Producing them for export would not be environmentally sustainable, he said.

With the proper government policies aimed at leveraging the country's proximity to critical minerals like lithium and cobalt, however, it could become a battery manufacturing hub, he said.

""There's a realistic chance that South Africa, with enough focus, with all the raw materials in the neighbourhood, they could be a champion,"" Schaefer said."
1142686013,20231127,"Any person experiencing or at risk of domestic violence is entitled to take five fully paid days of leave from work under new legislation which comes into force from Monday.

Under the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023, employers will be legally required to offer up to five days of paid leave over a period of 12 months to employees affected by domestic violence, including coercive control, or where an employee is supporting their spouse, partner or child who is the victim.

The State was one of the first countries in the European Union to introduce this right to paid leave, said Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman on Monday. “No one experiencing domestic violence should have to risk poverty or unemployment in order to seek support,” said the Minister.

“Domestic violence leave is not just about the leave. It can start conversations in workplaces and society around domestic violence and raise awareness. Employers have a crucial role to play and I would encourage them to use the supports which have been developed to create a safe space for employees experiencing domestic violence.”

The leave can be taken without prior notice to the employer and can be used to access help from the An Garda Síochána; source alternative accommodation; get a court order; seek medical attention; go to victim services organisations or seek counselling, according to a statement from the department. The Minister has previously said that a person requesting the leave would not have to provide any evidence of the abuse which is a deliberate decision to make access to the paid leave as easy as possible.

Unlike most new legislation which is reviewed after four-five years, this legislation will be reviewed after two years.

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which introduced the legislation on Monday, has also launched a website in collaboration with Women’s Aid to support and guide employers on how to provide this leave for a staff member.

The dedicated website – www.DVatWork.ie – provides employers with essential information on supporting a victim of domestic violence, including information around the importance of total confidentiality and a clear definition of domestic violence. In its guidance note, Women’s Aid encourages employers to clearly communicate to their staff the availability of domestic violence leave and to include information on the policy in the organisation’s employee handbook.

Women’s Aid will also be holding a series of webinars – which are now open for registration – for all employers providing advice and information on domestic violence policies, said the department."

Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday. For years, it seems, we’ve talked about the erosion of the “cordon sanitaire” in Western politics. Far-right parties have been making steady inroads into parliaments across Europe. Some factions descended from explicitly neofascist movements. Others embraced a set of extremist views once considered beyond the pale on a continent still largely defined by a 20th-century liberal-democratic consensus, born out of the traumas of World War II. Even as the far right’s vote shares and ranks of elected lawmakers grew, more mainstream parties vowed to never form alliances with them or enable their entry into government.

In a shock result, the far-right Freedom Party led by longtime firebrand politico Geert Wilders claimed 37 of the Dutch legislature’s 150 seats, more than doubling its footprint after 2021 elections. Wilders’s faction, known by the Dutch acronym PVV, now is the largest party in parliament and theoretically in position to dictate the fate of the country’s next government. A complicated period of wrangling will follow involving the alphabet soup of parties that comprise the country’s fragmented political landscape, as it’s unclear Wilders can actually cobble together a coalition that would let him take power.

After the vote, Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, the leader of the center-right party of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte, ruled out joining any bloc led by Wilders, but did not foreclose the possibility of supporting a minority government from the sidelines. Frans Timmermans, the former E.U. climate chief now at the head of a center-left Labor-Green alliance that came in second, thinks his faction will end up in the opposition. The last Dutch government took 299 days to form and it’s likely the next one will take longer.

Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Rally, has spent a generation alongside Wilders battling her way into Europe’s political mainstream and has a significant chance to be France’s next president. She also shares Wilders’s antipathy to the workings of the European Union. The Dutch voters “demonstrate that more and more countries within the European Union are contesting the way it works,” Le Pen said.

“Everywhere in Europe we see the same right-wing wind blowing,” Tom Van Grieken, a Belgian hard-right populist, said after Wilders’s victory. “The advance that has been underway for a while is clearly continuing in the Netherlands. We share our patriotism and want to put our people first again. Nothing can match that motivation.”

The Dutch result comes alongside other political wins for the far right on the continent. “Far-right parties have taken power in Italy, extended their rule in Hungary, earned a coalition role in Finland, become de facto government partners in Sweden, entered Parliament in Greece and made striking gains in regional elections in Austria and Germany,” my colleagues charted, pointing also to recent election results in Slovakia and the entrenched, if not victorious, position of far-right factions in Spain and Poland.

That simply may be because voters believe in their appeal more than in the past. “Polling during the campaign showed that Dutch voters were most concerned with health care, integrity in government and economic security,” noted the Economist. “But antipathy towards immigrants was also high on the list. Many Dutch blame immigrants for exacerbating a housing shortage. Almost no parties challenged the consensus.”

“On issues the far right sees as most important in Europe — immigration, crime committed by immigrants, the multicultural society, the western debate on gender, more traditional views on families — many other parties have now adapted to their rhetoric,” Ann-Cathrine Jungar, a political scientist at Sweden’s Södertörn University, told my colleagues. “Far-right parties and their agendas have entered the mainstream. They are the new normal.”

The ability of the far right to break into the castle has always been contingent on the center-right establishment lowering the drawbridge. Rutte, currently the longest-serving Western European head of government, spent more than a decade marginalizing Wilders while also trying to curry favor with Wilders’s supporters. Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, Rutte’s successor, effectively opened the door further this election cycle when she indicated she would be willing to forge a coalition with them — imagining far-right support would help make her prime minister.

“Wilders is perhaps the cleanest example of how mainstream center-right parties can empower the far right,” Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who tracks European politics, told me. “[Yeşilgöz-Zegerius] thought that would make voters who want a more right-wing government rally around her; instead it made Wilders a newly acceptable option for many of those voters, and Wilders jumped on the opportunity by downplaying — but certainly not abandoning — some of his most heinous views.”

Those heinous views include calls to curb Muslim immigration — for which Wilders was once convicted of insulting a racial group — and ban mosques and the Quran. Whatever the extremism of his ideology, the Dutch political ecosystem did little to challenge or undermine it. “After almost 25 years of catering to far-right voters, allegedly to defeat far-right parties, a far-right party is by far the biggest party in parliament,” noted Dutch political scientist Cas Mudde.

And yet, Wilders may not be able to make much of his current gains, given the complexity of building a government with centrist support, or the distinct possibility that a ruling coalition with him at the helm is still a non-starter for many would-be allies. Winning 37 out of 150 seats is a striking result, but not a definitive mandate."
1142692285,20231127,"Residents of Juba’s Hai Mauna area have concluded that majority of Gender-Based Violence cases in South Sudan are not being reported due to fear of stigma and lack of proper confidentiality.

Rape and child marriage emerged as the most alarming cases of gender-based violence during the community awareness program conducted by South Sudan Law Society (SSLS) and Legal Action Worldwide (LAW), as South Sudan marks 16 Days of Activism against GBV.

The European Union (EU) funded project drew more than 100 Mauna residents.

Oliver Taban from SSLS said the community awareness session was to inform the public about the work of the Justice Confidence Centre (JCC).

“These awareness sessions help communities to understand the basic concepts of gender-based violence and the service providers,” he stated.

Taban stressed the need to develop and strengthen legal aid services specializing in tackling cases related to GBV in the country.

According to a 2018 study, violence against women and girls in South Sudan remains an endemic problem inhibiting the full participation of women in decision making at the community economy and society in general.

“There is an acute need to improve women’s knowledge of their rights, and opportunities for them to demand, access and enforce their rights,” it noted.

Mauna area chief, Bidal Fraizer said gender bias and the culture of impunity explains the low rate of reporting gender-based violence cases.

“Poverty also leads to more gender-based violence, including child marriage, often for bride price, sexual exploitation and abuse, or limited access to sexual and reproductive health rights,” he said on Saturday.

Bidal, however, stressed the need for people to report gender-based violence but they become more conservative in the South Sudan society where women do not report anything to do with rape or even GBV cases.

Jennifer Elimani, a facilitator, said GBV is deeply rooted in gender inequality, harmful social and gender norms and a highly patriarchal community and legal systems, compounding violence against women.

“GBV is driven by discriminatory social norms and power inequalities between men and women and compounded by a highly patriarchal legal system and the use of customary laws that often condone GBV,” she said.

Elimani called for provision of in-depth training to targeted influencers in the communities and more awareness raising on GVB and its consequences.

For her part, Mary John, a resident of the Mauna area, emphasized the need to put in place and support customary courts to handle and refer GBV-related cases.

Up to 90 % of GBV cases are heard in customary courts presided by older male judges who have deeply ingrained patriarchal views, and which generally condone domestic violence, a study conducted by SSLS showed.

“This discourages women from seeking justice, but it also leads to women accusing their husbands of excessive abuse to being sentenced and sometimes being punished more harshly than their husbands,” it stressed.

South Sudan accounts for the second highest prevalence case of GBV in the East Africa region.

According to a 2018 study, substantial proportions of women (aged 15-64) in South Sudan experience gender-based violence either in the form of physical (34.0%) or sexual (13.5%) violence in their lifetime."

1142696244,20231127,"Consumers in the European Union (EU) might experience higher prices to fund enhanced rights for gig workers, but this won’t jeopardize the industry’s business model, according to Nicolas Schmit, the EU’s Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights.

In discussions around a potential directive, which, if passed, would compel ride-sharing and delivery companies like Uber and Deliveroo to provide greater social protections to workers on their platforms, EU officials estimate that service prices, such as those for Uber, could surge by up to 40 per cent.

Schmit expressed confidence that consumers would accept the price hikes if it meant improved conditions for gig workers. He emphasised the necessity for a balance between the interests of consumers and service providers in the economy, stating that there is a cost that “has to be paid” to ensure fair worker rights.

The directive, currently under debate by the European Parliament, member states, and the European Commission, is expected to reach its final phase by the end of November.

Addressing concerns raised by Anabel Díaz, head of Uber’s mobility division in Europe, who warned of potential shutdowns in hundreds of EU cities if prices rose significantly, Schmit dismissed the notion that better worker protection would kill the industry’s model.

He likened Uber’s argument to historical instances of scaremongering, emphasizing the need for businesses to adapt rather than threatening legislative bodies.

Schmit referred to ongoing court cases in Europe as evidence of the need for a new directive to provide clarity for businesses.

He pointed out that the UK’s recent Supreme Court ruling on Deliveroo riders and the 2021 UK court ruling designating Uber drivers as “workers” highlight the lack of clarity in the gig economy.

The proposed directive aims to clarify the status of platform workers, allowing them to remain self-employed without being considered “bogus self-employed.”"
1142696245,20231127,"The European Union (EU) says it will provide 59 million euro (about K108.3 billion) to Malawi from the first quarter of 2024 for a gender responsive programme.

EU Ambassador Rune Skinnebach made the announcement on Saturday in Mzimba District during the launch of 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) campaign, Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse In-Country Network and celebrating the success of the Spotlight Initiative programme in Malawi.

He said the funding will help to reduce GBV, increase the resilience and livelihoods of women and girls from vulnerable backgrounds through economic empowering activities.

Said Skinnebach: “It was only two weeks ago when together with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Gender, we signed a new finance agreement paving the way for a new joint programme focused on gender responsive social protection which aims at social and economic empowerment of women and girls in the country.”

In her remarks, United Nations Resident Coordinator Rebecca Adda-Dontoh said there was enough evidence proving that external shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic, conflicts, and climate change have intensified violence against women and girls.

She said they have under the Spotlight Initiative been able to provide services to both perpetrators and survivors of gender based violence but also enhance national and community structures for preventing, monitoring and reporting on gender-based violence,

“Mobilise parliamentarians to allocate sufficient resources in the national and district budgets to prevent violence against women and girls. Advocate for increased investments from donor partners towards preventing violence against women and girls, including more long-term sustainable investments,” said Dontoh.

Minister of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare Jean Sendeza has called on all community and political leaders to take a lead in combating GBV.

She said: “Some service providers and humanitarian workers use their positions of power to engage in sexual activities and abuse those affected by taking advantage of their vulnerability. Such malpractices are inhumane; prohibited by the Constitution and, therefore, punishable by law.”

Besides launching the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence campaign, the minister also launched the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse In-Country Network.

The network coordinates and oversees the protection from sexual exploitation and abusive activities in humanitarian work, development work as well as in peace keeping missions in Malawi.

Each year, 245 million women and girls aged 15 years or older globally experience physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by a current or former intimate partner."
1142704531,20231127,"Bluetongue virus has been found in four cows near Canterbury following the first case of the disease earlier this month, with farmers urged to remain vigilant.

A 10km temporary control zone (TCZ) has been put in place around the two impacted farms, restricting the movement of susceptible animals except under licence.

The infected animals will be culled to reduce the risk of onward disease transmission, the government confirmed.

The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) identified the first case of the disease on 11 November through Britain's annual bluetongue surveillance programme.

Before this, the last outbreak of bluetongue in the UK was in 2007, meaning it had been officially free of the virus since 2011.

The virus is transmitted by midge bites and affects cows, goats, sheep and other camelids such as llamas.

The midges are most active between April and November and not all susceptible animals show immediate, or any, signs of contracting the virus.

Impacts on susceptible animals can vary greatly – some show no symptoms or effects at all while for others it can cause productivity issues such as reduced milk yield, while in the most severe cases can be fatal for infected animals.

Christine Middlemiss, the UK’s Chief Veterinary Officer, has urged farmers to remain vigilant for bluetongue virus following the four new cases.

“Bluetongue does not pose a threat to human health or food safety, but the disease can impact livestock farms, and cause productivity issues,"" she said.

“This detection is an example of our robust disease surveillance procedures in action and it is also a clear reminder for farmers that the disease remains a threat, despite coming towards the end of the midge activity season.

“Farmers must remain vigilant and report any suspicions to APHA.”

Farmers have been reminded by APHA that animals imported from impacted regions must be accompanied by the relevant paperwork to show they meet certain conditions designed to reduce disease risk, such as correct vaccination.

NI and GB ruminants cannot be exported from an GB Assembly Centre to the European Union or moved to Northern Ireland until further notice.

BTV is a notifiable disease. Suspicion of BTV in animals in England must be reported to the Animal and Plant Health Agency on 03000 200 301.

Farmers in and around the TCZ can also call Ruminant Health & Welfare's (RH&W) bluetongue hotline on 024 7771 0386 for advice.

Bluetongue does not affect people or food safety."

1142708739,20231127,"The Interior Ministry announced a major operation in Türkiye’s east on Monday in a bid to destroy the winter hideouts of the terrorist group PKK. The operation comes one day after an attack by the PKK in northern Iraq, which killed three Turkish soldiers.

Minister Ali Yerlikaya said in a social media post that “Heroes-30” – the latest in a string of counterterrorism operations launched after PKK’s Oct. 1 attack that targeted police headquarters in the capital Ankara – covered six provinces. Yerlikaya said gendarmerie forces destroyed 63 caves, shelters and depots used by the terrorist group to hide munitions in rural parts of the country to be used in terror attacks in winter. Operations were held in the provinces of Şırnak, Siirt, Kahramanmaraş, Diyarbakır, Muş and Tunceli. Soldiers, flanked by indigenously developed ATAK helicopters and armed drones, combed the terrorist shelters and discovered sniper rifles, grenades, explosives, landmines, material used for making explosives, survival kits and a large cache of ammunition before destroying the shelters.

Also on Monday, the Defense Ministry announced that three soldiers were killed during a counterterrorist operation in northern Iraq.

Soldiers Necdet Çalış and Emrah Gündüz were “martyred and two soldiers were wounded due to an attack by members of the separatist terrorist organization” in Türkiye’s Operation Claw-Lock zone, the ministry said in a statement. One of the wounded, identified as Fevzi Kızıltaş, later succumbed to his injuries, it added. The terrorists’ affiliation was not specified, but the PKK terrorist group has been known to be active in the region.

Türkiye launched Operation Claw-Lock last year in April to target the PKK terror group’s hideouts in the Metina, Zap and Avasin-Basyan regions of northern Iraq, located near the Turkish border. It was preceded by two operations and Claw-Eagle launched in 2020 to root out terrorists hiding in the north of Iraq and plotting cross-border attacks in Türkiye.

In its more than 40-year terror campaign against Türkiye, the PKK-listed as a terrorist organization by Türkiye, the United States, Britain and the European Union, has been responsible for the deaths of more than 40,000 people, including women, children and infants.

The terrorist group, which launched its first attacks in eastern Türkiye in the 1980s, has been more active in the southeast provinces, from Diyarbakır to Şırnak, but expanded its attacks to further north and even infiltrated into the Black Sea region. Incessant counterterrorism operations in recent years, however, significantly reduced the PKK’s presence in all regions from the north to the east. Authorities say only dozens of terrorists are now in hiding in Türkiye. The PKK, however, retains hideouts and an unknown number of recruits in the northern regions of Iraq and Syria, both near Turkish borders.

The Defense Ministry announced last week that Türkiye neutralized 1,927 PKK terrorists inside the country, in Iraq and Syria, including 59 in the preceding week. “Neutralized” is a term used to describe terrorists captured alive and dead. “Thus, the number of terrorists neutralized since July 24, 2015, has reached 39,270,” the ministry’s press adviser, Adm. Zeki Aktürk, said at a press briefing, referring to the date of Türkiye’s first major cross-border operations against the terrorist group after a brief lull.

Aktürk also noted that 110 terrorists turned themselves in since January, pointing out that two terrorists surrendered last week after fleeing Iraq in the previous instance of surrenders. “Operations in Türkiye and beyond the borders dealt a heavy blow to the terrorist group and brought their activities almost to a halt,” he highlighted. Aktürk said security forces recently raided a large cave used as a hideout by terrorists in northern Iraq and confiscated a large cache of munitions. In Syria’s north, Turkish troops faced terrorist attacks but duly responded to them, Aktürk said. He highlighted that terrorists carried out 445 attacks, including those involving harassment fire since Jan. 1, but Turkish forces retaliated by striking the terrorist positions. On border security, Aktürk said they intercepted 12,467 people since Jan. 1 before they infiltrated into Türkiye and 576 among them were terrorists."

1142717165,20231127,"Updated November 27, 2023 at 8:14 AM ET

A major, annual international climate meeting kicks off later this week in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.

World leaders are meeting from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12 to discuss the effects of climate change, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the increasingly pressing question of who will pay for the costs of a hotter planet.

Attendance at the annual negotiations has ballooned and hit an estimated 45,000 people last year. Thousands of climate scientists, mayors, activists, corporate executives and representatives of major oil companies will also fly to the petroleum-dependent host country to attend hundreds of side events.

The meeting comes at the close of the hottest year ever recorded on Earth. Extreme weather is killing people around the world. And while it's still possible for humans to avoid catastrophic climate change effects — such as mass extinctions and runaway sea level rise by the end of this century — it is only possible if greenhouse gas pollution falls dramatically and immediately, scientists warn.

Meanwhile, a fight is brewing over whether the countries most responsible for causing climate change will follow through on promises to help the most vulnerable countries foot the bill for adapting to a hotter world.

Here's what you need to know about what's at stake and what to expect.

Why is this meeting happening and what is it supposed to achieve?

This meeting happens every year and is arranged by the branch of the United Nations that handles global negotiations about climate change. In U.N.-speak, the climate meeting is called the Conference of the Parties, or COP. This is the 28th Conference of the Parties, so it's called COP28.

At the end of the 2015 COP meeting, world leaders signed the landmark Paris climate agreement.

The Paris Agreement requires virtually every country on Earth to pledge how much they'll cut planet-warming pollution and update those plans every few years. The goal is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to temperatures in the late 1800s, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.

This year, world leaders are required to review humanity's collective progress toward that goal. And the situation is not good.

A U.N. analysis released this month found that global greenhouse gas emissions are still rising, and the planet is on track for at least 2.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. And while it's still possible to stay below 2 degrees of warming — and every tenth of a degree of warming the world avoids will save lives — scientists warn that the 1.5 degree target is slipping away.

These meetings have been happening for 30 years, and it feels like climate change is only getting worse. Do they really matter?

Last year's COP27 meeting in Egypt ended with a watered-down agreement that left out language calling for a phaseout of all fossil fuels — the biggest driver of global warming.

The summits have become a circus, ""with the petrostates as the ringmasters"" and everyone else as ""the clowns,"" Sandrine Dixson-Declève wrote last year, as co-president of The Club of Rome, a nonprofit in Switzerland that works on climate change.

The problem, Dixson-Declève told NPR, is combining international negotiations with a trade show. The number of lobbyists who attend the events has soared, she says, and civil society groups struggle to afford the cost of reserving pavilion space in the COP conference hall.

""Some are actually given easier access than others because they can pay for it. And that means that those that have pavilions might be able to invite certain governments to come and have a conversation,"" Dixson-Declève says. ""It may not seem like direct lobbying, but it is potentially indirect lobbying, depending on where the conversation goes. So I think it's incredibly important that we take into consideration this aspect, which has created a very unfair playing field.""

Yet the COP meetings remain crucial events for activists and poor countries hit hardest by climate-fueled disasters.

""One of the big values of the U.N. process, actually, is that everybody's at the table,"" says David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute.

The meetings are not ""a panacea,"" Waskow adds, but they ""give us a sense of the direction we need to travel in and also can be a catalyst.""

Rishikesh Ram Bhandary, assistant director of the Global Economic Governance Initiative at Boston University, says he understands the public's frustration with the climate talks. Part of it seems to stem from a mismatch between the U.N.'s multilateral process, which ensures every country has a say but often delivers incremental progress, and the urgency people feel as the impacts of climate change get worse.

That tension has only grown as the United Arab Emirates, a big oil producer, prepares to host this year's meeting.

Given its knowledge of oil and gas, the UAE has a chance to chart a practical but ambitious path to move the world off of fossil fuels, Dixson-Declève says.

""That would be the perfect scenario,"" she says.

But the world seems to be moving in the opposite direction. António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, said earlier in November that governments ""are literally doubling down on fossil fuel production.""

What will be a contentious topic at these talks?

One of the biggest debates will be over compensation that wealthier countries could pay to nations hardest hit by climate change. It's known as ""loss and damage."" Lower-income countries bear the brunt of climate impacts, such as floods, fires and drought that cause billions of dollars in destruction. But they have contributed little to the planetary warming driving those disasters.

Countries like the U.S. and those in Europe built their wealth through fossil fuel use and are responsible for most of the heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere today.

For years, developing nations have argued that they're owed for the damage caused by climate change. Loss and damage funding could be used to prepare for future impacts, like building infrastructure or relocating communities, as well as compensating them for irreplaceable cultural resources that have been lost.

At the 2022 climate summit, countries made a historic agreement to create a fund especially for that purpose. Since then, negotiations have been bumpy. Countries have argued about which nations should pay into the fund, which should be eligible to receive funding and where the fund is housed.

Right now, the plan is for the World Bank to house the ""loss and damage"" fund temporarily. But global leaders would need to sign off on that plan at the COP28 talks. And some developing countries are concerned about the plan, because it only urges, not requires, richer countries to contribute funding.

Why is money such a big topic at the meeting?

Industrialized countries have pledged $100 billion annually to developing countries to help them adapt to global warming and move away from fossil fuels, but studies suggest much more money is needed.

""The needs for climate finance are much, much higher — more on the order of a trillion dollars per year,"" says Laura Kuhl, assistant professor of public policy and international affairs at Northeastern University.

A recent assessment from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development says developing countries will need at least $2.4 trillion each year by 2026.

This money — called ""climate finance"" — can help developing countries switch from planet-heating fossil fuels to clean energy. It also includes money for adapting to climate change.

Stacy-ann Robinson, an associate professor of environmental studies at Colby College, says you can't talk about climate finance without talking about climate justice.

""Countries in the Global South,"" Robinson says, ""are saying, 'Listen, we contributed the least to historical greenhouse gas emissions, but based on a number of factors — environmental and otherwise — we will be impacted the most.'""

That's why back in 2009 at the climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, industrialized nations announced that they would take the lead on climate finance. They pledged that by 2020, they would give $100 billion each year toward funding climate adaptation and reducing fossil fuel use in the Global South.

They missed the 2020 goal. And although industrialized nations may have finally reached the $100 billion mark in 2022, in Dubai the discussions will center on how to get closer to the trillion dollar range. This will involve engaging countries, institutions like the World Bank and the IMF, and the private sector.

How do wars in the Middle East and Ukraine affect climate talks this year?

They won't help. Climate diplomacy is already contentious. The conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are further complicating, if not worsening, diplomatic relations among some of the world's largest historic contributors to climate change — namely, the United States, Russia and China.

U.N. Secretary-General Guterres acknowledged the problem in recent remarks, saying that it's clear that world leaders face ""distractions"" from addressing climate change.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has trashed its relations with the U.S. and the European Union, which have been providing Ukraine with billions of dollars in aid and weaponry.

At last year's climate talks, representatives from developing countries raised questions about why rich countries like the U.S. have been quick to deliver weapons, while slow-walking funds for climate adaptation and clean energy.

Those concerns are likely to come up again in Dubai, as the U.S. is now delivering billions of dollars more to Israel.

Israel's continued bombardment of the Gaza Strip is also raising the ire of other countries in the Middle East and Global South, and a broader regional conflict could cause chaos in the world's energy markets.

All of this makes it more difficult for world leaders to maintain consensus and focus on addressing the global issue of human-caused climate change.

1142714815,20231127,"(MENAFN) In a recent development, divisions within the European Union (EU) have surfaced over the proposed sanctions on Russia, as reported by Bloomberg. Several European Union member states are reportedly seeking to dilute the recommendations put forth by the European Commission, which aims to prevent the circumvention of sanctions on Russia through third-party nations.

 

 The European Commission's proposal, designed to counteract attempts to bypass sanctions on Russia, particularly in light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, suggests restrictions on trade with nations capable of re-exporting goods from the European Union to Russia. The targeted goods include high-priority items such as semiconductors with potential applications in weapons production. The proposed mechanism requires buyers to deposit a specified sum in an escrow account, ensuring compliance with the outlined sanctions. Notably, a portion of the deposited amount would be earmarked for a trust fund benefiting Ukraine, with contracts subject to termination in case of sanctions breach.

 

 However, insiders familiar with the matter reveal that diplomats from certain large European Union countries, not identified by Bloomberg, have voiced reservations about the proposed measures. Concerns center around the legality of the sanctions and the feasibility of imposing stringent guarantees and clauses on importers. Skepticism has emerged, raising questions about the enforceability and practicality of such measures.

 

 Sources suggest that these member states advocating for a softer approach are also pushing to narrow the scope of the proposed clauses and limit the list of targeted items. The argument put forth by these countries revolves around potential disadvantages for European Union businesses, with the belief that the proposed measures could impact competitiveness.

 

 Conversely, other European Union member states, including the Baltic countries, reportedly support the European Commission's proposals. The divide within the European Union underscores the complexity of forging a unified stance on sanctions against Russia, as differing perspectives on legal, economic, and competitive implications come to the forefront. As discussions continue, the European Union faces the challenge of balancing the need for robust measures against Russia with the internal dynamics of member states seeking to safeguard their economic interests."
1142720479,20231127,"Africa's core focus at Conference of Party (COP 28) will be to enhance action on adaptation and resilience against the consequences of climate change, the Lead Coordinator and Negotiator for Africa on Climate Adaptation, Patience Thelma Melfah Damptey, has disclosed.

She explained that Africa was exceptionally vulnerable to climate variability and climate change, which affect millions of people and make adaptation efforts more pressing as rapid changes in weather patterns erode the productivity of local water and food systems and generate unintended consequences for sustainable development.

“It is expected that COP 28 would adopt a concrete, science-based framework to achieve the goal on adaptation and enhance for adaptation efforts,” she said.

At the Pre-COP 28 meeting in Accra last Tuesday, Mrs Damptey said “due to historical greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, we in Africa have had to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change in the past decades, so we need to find efficient and effective ways of implementing our adaptation needs and priorities for our survival, especially for the younger generations.”

The meeting, organised by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Science and Technology Policy Research Institute (CSIR-STEPRI) in collaboration with International Water Management Institute West Africa (IWMI), was on the theme: “Road to COP 28 –Harmonising science and policy perspectives towards Ghana’s climate adaptation priorities and resilience building to support global efforts.”

It aimed to enhance advocacy and knowledge of climate adaptation, to collectively identify important pathways for addressing critical climate priorities and challenges towards climate resilience building for Ghana and Africa at large.

The meeting is in line with CSIR-STEPRI's mandate of policy engagements under a six-year European Union (EU) funded research project: “Resilience against Climate Change-Social Transformation Research and Policy Advocacy (REACH STR) Project.”

The 2023 Gap Report indicates that despite the clear signs of accelerating climate risks and impacts worldwide, the adaptation finance gap is widening and now stands at between US$194 billion and US$366 billion per year.

Adaptation finance needs are 10–18 times as great as current international public adaptation finance flows – at least 50 per cent higher than previously estimated.

The report also states that international public climate finance flows to developing countries decreased by 15 per cent to US $21.3 billion in 2021, after having increased to US $25.2 billion between 2018 and 2020.

It thus calls for an increased focus on several topics underlying effective and adequate adaptation.

These include governance arrangements, transparency of policy processes, capacity-building, technology transfer, finance and equity.

The Deputy Minister of Energy, Herbert Krapa, said to advance Ghana’s climate adaptation policy, it was necessary to invest in research and innovation to better understand the climate risks the country faced.

He said that would create a conducive atmosphere that fosters collaboration between scientists, policymakers and communities.

The collaboration, he said, is essential for ensuring that climate adaptation policies are aligned with scientific evidence and meet the specific needs of our communities."

Two weeks out from a crucial summit in Beijing, frustration is mounting in Brussels that China is not taking EU concerns on trade and geopolitics seriously.

Trade tensions are threatening to bubble over, as the bloc considers action against Chinese subsidies of electric vehicles, wind turbines, medical technology and solar equipment.

European Union leaders rail against overcapacity in the Chinese economy which they fear will be exported to Europe, while rumours swirl around the use of the new foreign subsidies regulation to stymie Chinese battery giant CATL’s massive investments in Hungary. And serious concerns persist about China’s close ties to Russia.

At the same time, a series of Chinese-backed events in the city promoted closer partnership, without addressing the many concerns held in EU institutions.

The exasperation came to the surface on Thursday at another event hosted by Chinese diplomats to toast 20 years of a “comprehensive strategic partnership” with the EU.

A glossy magazine was printed for the occasion, filled with long articles about how the two sides needed to get along, and touting ground for collaboration.

But officials clashed over subsidies and Beijing’s alleged use of economic coercion against Lithuania over Taiwan, suggesting the EU-China Summit could be a bruising affair.

“After 20 years of comprehensive strategic partnership, in our eyes, in Chinese eyes, we are closer to each other, but maybe not to the case for the Europeans, because you see us as systemic rivals all of a sudden,” veteran Chinese diplomat Ma Keqing said at a Friends of Europe forum.

“Actually, we were different, many, many years ago, and who have been different for the whole process of our relations. And now, suddenly we have become systemic rivals … so I would like to say that we should have more dialogue and more mutual trust.”

The tone of the event prompted one senior EU official to interject from the audience.

“Dialogue is necessary, but it is not enough. We need also to see that the results of those discussions materialise in tangible rebalancing of the relationship,” said Eva Valle Lagares, the EU’s top trade official for China.

“Trust is not built with actions such as blocking all trade with Lithuania. Trust is not built by broadly formulated export controls on key materials that are essential for the green transition, that are formulated in a very broad manner with very non-clear security justifications.”

Earlier at the event, Chinese ambassador to the EU Fu Cong had made a rare explicit admission that Beijing had officially punished Lithuania for hosting a controversially named Taiwanese diplomatic office in Vilnius. China’s countermeasures ranged from downgrading its embassy in Vilnius to blockading trade.

“This concerns one of the fundamental principles of Chinese foreign policy, which is the one-China policy. So if a country actually harms that basic principle, we will take responsive actions, I think that is understood,” Fu said.

Asked by the Post whether China was open to normalising ties with Lithuania, Fu said he was not “privy to the diplomatic negotiations”.

The EU and China are embroiled in a World Trade Organization dispute over what Brussels says was an overnight Chinese embargo on all Lithuanian exports. Beijing has claimed, in defence, that its importers simply do not want to buy goods from countries that disrespect Chinese sovereignty.

Fu also clashed with top EU trade officials over subsidies. He dismissed EU concerns that China was exporting the overcapacity in its manufacturing sector, a charge angled by officials, businesses and economists.

“Chinese companies selling cars in Europe does not by itself signify overcapacity … if finding an overseas market can be interpreted as overcapacity domestically, what are the European companies doing in the Chinese market?” Fu said.

“For instance, Mercedes have been selling cars to China for decades. So are you saying that there is an overcapacity on their part? They are selling cars because they have overcapacity domestically? I don’t think that logic stands.”

The remarks drew an annoyed response from Maria Martin-Prat, the deputy director general for trade and one-time lead negotiator with China, who just a few years ago had the task of defending the now-collapsed investment deal with Beijing in public.

“We need to talk but also need to acknowledge realities,” she said, adding that it was not “difficult” to show where the problem was.

“We don’t have a problem with anyone selling goods in our market. The European market is a very open market, which should not be taken for granted. When we have a problem is when there are practices that distort the level playing field.”

The exchanges suggest little common ground has been found during recent months of extensive diplomatic exchanges, during which eight EU commissioners travelled to Beijing.

EU sources privately admit there will be few tangible outcomes from the summit on December 7 and 8 in the Chinese capital. There are concerns that it may be another “dialogue of the deaf”, the term used by Brussels’ top diplomat Josep Borrell to describe last year’s edition. Three sources said that as with the previous two summits, there would be no joint statement in Beijing next month.

The date for the summit was set quite late, and the political capital needed to negotiate a statement would not match anything that could be achieved, one of the sources said. A second said that any official document would just gather dust in a cupboard afterwards, so it was seen as a waste of time.

A third diplomatic source said the statement was never discussed, and suggested that holding the summit was a “deliverable” in itself. “When you have a summit with Canada or Australia you’re expecting a list [of outcomes] as long as your arm, but nobody expects that here.”

Attendees of the events noted that the two sides were talking at cross purposes, with the EU “bringing hard evidence” and specific concerns only to be met with “Chinese generalities and pleasant rhetoric”.

“I suspect it’s exactly how the summit is going to go, too,” one non-EU diplomat said.

Sari Arho Havrén, a RUSI associate fellow based in Brussels specialising in China’s foreign relations, said: “It was like driving on two opposing lanes, China repeating their talking points over and over again, the EU calling their bluff.

“The audience – Europeans – have awakened to the reality and it’s increasingly hard for the Chinese party to keep convincing them otherwise.”"
1142720488,20231127,"The effectiveness of European sanctions on Moscow has been called into question, as Russia is still able to access European products via its neighbours.

The European Union's first 11 packages of economic sanctions against Russia have resulted in ""limited market loss"" for France's 145,000 exporters, according to an international economics institute.

France's Centre for Prospective Studies and International Information (Cepii), which sits within the Office of the Prime Minister, said on Monday that all products subject to sanctions on Russia ""correspond to less than 1% of the value of French exports in 2021 (0.8%), or around €4 billion"".

French exporters are feeling the effects of sanctions related to Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine, launched in February 2022, mainly in three sectors: transportation equipment (including aeronautics), chemicals, and machinery.

Of the 2,436 French companies affected by restrictions on exports to Russia, 809 specialise in machinery, 554 in chemicals and 206 in transport.

In terms of value, transport companies alone have had to absorb almost half of the 4 billion in losses incurred in France as a result of European sanctions.

But the economic consequences of these retaliatory measures have been mitigated by ""a detour of trade towards Russia's neighbouring countries"", according to Cepii economists Charlotte Emlinger and Kevin Lefebvre.

""While French exports to Russia fell by 52% between 2021 and 2022, those to Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan rose by 85%, 62% and 44% respectively,"" they note.

These figures ""question the effectiveness of trade sanctions"" by the European Union, two weeks after the European Commission proposed a 12th package of sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine.

The authors consider it possible that Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan ""will re-export this surplus of products to Russia, enabling it to retain access to European technologies"" despite the sanctions intended to deprive Moscow of this access."
1142724452,20231127,"The foreign ministers of the European Union will meet with representatives of Arab countries in Barcelona on Monday to discuss how to bring an end to the humanitarian catastrophe being caused by the war between Israel and Hamas, and to draw up a road map for the future of the Gaza strip and Palestine when the guns fall silent. The forum of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), an organization dedicated to fostering cooperation between EU countries and those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean and whose discussions are usually of a technical nature, will this time be a space for high-level political dialogue on a war that threatens to spread throughout the region and is already widening the gulf between the West and Muslim countries.

The guest of honor at the meeting is the Saudi Arabian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, who is not a member of the UfM but will lay out the conclusions of the summit held between Arab and Islamic countries on November 11 in Riyadh and who will speak on behalf of the Arab-Islamic ministerial committee. The Riyadh meeting was attended, among many others, by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who visited the Saudi kingdom for the first time after the recent reconciliation between the two countries, which was mediated by China.

The Barcelona meeting, which brings together 43 countries, is expected to break the record for participation in this type of forum, with 27 delegations represented at ministerial level. Among the European ministers who have confirmed their attendance are those of France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, and Portugal, while representing the Arab nations will be the heads of diplomacy of Jordan — which co-chairs the UfM — Egypt, Turkey, Tunisia, Lebanon, and Morocco, as well as the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).

The most notable absentee will be Israel, which announced last Thursday that it would leave its seat empty claiming that the agenda of the meeting had been altered, without consultation, to focus on the Gaza war, posing the risk that it would become a trap against the government of Benjamin Netanyahu.

Israel’s absence does not mean that there will not be serious debate. European sources acknowledge that it is difficult for some Arab countries to recognize Israel’s right to defend itself after the terrorist attack launched by Hamas on October 7. On the European side, some partners, such as Germany, are reluctant to ask the Israeli government for a ceasefire and limit themselves to calling for “pauses” to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Strip, although an appeal could be tabled to extend the current four-day truce.

Instead, consensus is likely to be reached on the need for an international conference to address the resolution of the Middle East conflict based on mutual recognition of two states — one Jewish and the other Palestinian — living in peace and security. Israel rejects this initiative, which was promoted by Spain and has already been taken up by the EU, the Arab League, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, whose representatives will also be in Barcelona.

According to EU sources, The bloc’s High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, will put forward the need to prepare for the post-conflict situation in Gaza, not only due to the destruction of essential infrastructure but also because of Israel’s stated objective of dismantling Hamas, which in addition to being an armed militia managed the administration of the daily life of more than two million Gazans in the Strip before the war. It will not only be a question of implementing a multi-million-dollar investment plan but of taking over the administration of the Strip, a role that Brussels believes the United Nations could perform, at least until the Palestinian Authority is in a position to do so.

At a dinner on Sunday evening attended by the heads of the delegations invited to the forum, Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs José Manuel Albares reiterated his condemnation of the “indiscriminate killing of civilians” carried out by Hamas on October 7 and demanded the “immediate and unconditional release of all the hostages” being held by militias in Gaza. “Spain has been very clear since the beginning of the crisis in calling for an immediate ceasefire and demanding that Israel scrupulously respect international humanitarian law,” said Albares, who also rejected Israel’s accusation that Madrid has aligned itself with Hamas, which the Islamist militia itself has fueled by applauding the position maintained by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo, during their recent tour of the region.

1142724453,20231127,"As conservatives, we’ve been lectured by the Left for years about “following the science.” Consider climate change. We’ve been told the “climate models” predict the end of the world if we don’t take drastic action to stop it. Drastic action like giving the climate change prophets of doom trillions of dollars to grow government to save the planet. How’s that working for us?

I haven’t figured out how we’re going to hold off this catastrophe by ourselves. No other nation seems to be jumping on the doomsday bandwagon to trash their economies. Russia, China, and India are not going to destroy their economies for the sake of the world. I wonder what they know that we don’t. Inquiring minds want to know. The European Union nations have not even tried to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement (that Donald Trump wisely canceled). They’ve had eight years to do something, but haven’t.

Democrats are all in on this. Joe Biden calls it the greatest threat to our nation. I thought MAGA supporters were the greatest threat! When did they get a downgrade? Barack Obama and John Kerry are definitely in, as is Biden. I’m really concerned for all three of them. Biden has a beach house in Delaware. Obama and Kerry also have beach property, which has me confused. Isn’t that a bad investment with the oceans rising? Again, inquiring minds want to know. Don’t forget Al Gore, whose personal carbon footprint is bigger than the town of Buck Snort, Tennessee.

Then there’s the “trans” crisis. I’m surprised we didn’t know about this decades ago, centuries ago, even millennia ago! It just suddenly appeared on our social radar. Men can be women; women can be men. Men can get pregnant and lactate. Children are persuaded by teachers and others they may not be the sex their evil parents told them they were. So, they’re convinced to be mutilated to conform to the identity they “feel” they are; or can I say, were persuaded to be.

Clinics in Europe that have been active in transitioning children are shutting down because of recent studies showing it causes great harm to children. If I remember correctly, this included the Netherlands, Sweden and Great Britain, maybe France. They’ve been doing it longer than the U.S. and realize they’ve damage children; yet progressives in America are doubling down without considering the harm being done.

In spite of the progress that has been made in race relations, Obama the “unifier” (insert laugh track here) threw a wrench into the works during his administration. Police were racist, as were Christians, conservatives, and Republicans. Biden and his unaccomplished team of bureaucrats have taken it to extremes; critical race theory, the 1619 Project (fake history), and other lies, trying to divide us into warring tribes. Will it work? Considering the tens of thousands of brain-washed kids protesting around the nation for Israel to be wiped off the face of the earth, I’d say YES!

Where has common sense gone? Why have so many people remained silent in the face of the absurdity of these people? It’s time to return to the faith of our Founding Fathers. It’s time to elect leaders who will uphold the Constitution as written. We need to stop the insanity!

Something to pray about!"

1142732487,20231127,"The ETC Securities are designed to provide investors with exposure to a metal without having to take physical delivery of the metal. The underlying ""Metal"" for the ETC Securities is: silver. Each ETC Security relates to a specific amount in weight of Metal, specified in the Final Terms, known as the ""Metal Entitlement per ETC Security"". On any particular day, the ETC Security can be viewed as giving an exposure to that ------amount of Metal as the amount payable in respect of each ETC Security and the value per ETC Security (the ""Value per ETC Security"") is linked to the value of the Metal, subject to an adjustment for any foreign exchange gains or losses between the Metal Currency (as defined below) and the Specified Currency. In order to back its obligations under the ETC Securities, the Issuer will seek to hold enough Metal to meet its obligations under the ETC Securities. The precise amount it holds at any time may be more or less than the aggregate amount of the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security to reflect the periodic payment of product fees and an adjustment for any foreign exchange gains or losses. The proceeds from the disposal of the underlying Metal, plus any interest received on the proceeds of such disposal less any negative interest, net of any deductions (and converted into the Specified Currency at the rate the Metal Agent determines would be obtainable at the time of conversion which shall be on or about the day of such sale (or, if such day is not an FX business day, the immediately following FX business day, and which may take into account a bid/offer spread quoted by a dealer), will equal the amount due under the ETC Securities (subject to certain minimum amounts owed). The Metal will be held for the Issuer by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor or replacement) (the ""Secured Account Custodian"") and will be generally held on an ""allocated"" basis. This means that specifically identifiable physical items of the Metal are allocated to the Issuer and are segregated from metal held for other clients of the custodian. However, for operational purposes, small amounts of Metal may be held on an ""unallocated"" basis. This means that the Secured Account Custodian maintains an account in the name of the Issuer which shows them as being entitled to delivery of a particular amount of the Metal but without specific physical metal having been identified. Where Metal is held on an ""unallocated"" basis the right to delivery is a purely contractual right and, as such, the Issuer is an unsecured creditor of the custodian and is exposed to the credit risk of the custodian. The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and any underlying Metal. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as ""Secured Property"" for this Series. Securityholders will not, by reason of holding such Series, have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities. The security will become enforceable if payment of the redemption amount in respect of such ETC Securities is not made when due on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the Scheduled Early Redemption Date (defined below) (if applicable). On the Scheduled Maturity Date, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Final Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Final Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount (defined below) and (ii) 10 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security as at the series issue date (the ""Minimum Debt Principal Amount"") plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Final Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Final Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the volume-weighted average prices per metal unit at which the Metal Agent (defined below) is able to sell the underlying Metal (""Average Metal Sale Price"") during the Final Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Final Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Final Redemption Valuation Date. ""Final Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date specified in the Final Terms or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. ""Specified Interest Amount"" is the amount of interest per ETC Security equal to that ETC Security's pro rata share of the amount of interest which has accrued (if any) on the proceeds of realisation of the underlying Metal deposited into the Series Cash Account (defined below) during or relating to the relevant redemption disposal period. Whilst interest may accrue at a positive, zero or negative rate on the Series Cash Account, the Specified Interest Amount is subject to a minimum of zero and any negative interest shall instead be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the underlying Metal. If any of the early redemption events occur, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Early Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Early Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount and (ii) the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Early Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Early Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the Average Metal Sale Price during the Early Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Early Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Early Redemption Valuation Date, save where the Issuer has suspended the determination of the value and Metal Entitlement per ETC Security and no replacement Series Counterparty is appointed, in which case the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the end of such suspension period. The ""Scheduled Early Redemption Date"" is the 8th business day following the Early Redemption Disposal Period. The ""Early Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date of the occurrence of an early redemption event or the date on which the Trustee gives notice that, due to the occurrence of an event of default, the ETC Securities shall become due and payable at their Early Redemption Amount on the Scheduled Early Redemption Date, or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. There can be no assurance that the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, will be greater than or equal to the amount invested by any securityholder. If the Final Metal Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, plus the Specified Interest Amount falls below the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount, then due to the limited recourse nature of the ETC Securities, securityholders are unlikely to receive payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, in full and may receive zero. The Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount per ETC Security, as applicable, will be determined by reference to the Average Metal Sale Price of the underlying Metal held in respect of the ETC Securities sold during the Final Redemption Disposal Period or Early Redemption Disposal Period, as applicable, by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (or any successor or replacement) as ""Metal Agent"", net of associated deductions and taxes. The Issuer will, on or prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date or Scheduled Early Redemption Date, publish the determination of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, (which shall include publication of the price, volume and date of each sale of underlying Metal during the relevant redemption disposal period, including information on any fees, deductions and/or taxes imposed on such sale, and the determination of the Average Metal Sale Price) on the website maintained on behalf of the Issuer at www.etf.dws.com (or such other website notified by the Issuer for the ETC Securities from time to time). The Metal Agent will pay the aggregate proceeds of such disposals (converted, if necessary, into the currency of the ETC Securities) to the cash account for the Series (the ""Series Cash Account"") maintained by J.P. Morgan SE as ""Account Bank"" as directed by the Programme Administrator (defined below). The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest. On early or final redemption of the ETC Securities, a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security, as the case may be. The foreign exchange hedge seeks to reduce the exposure of the ETC Securities to exchange rate fluctuations between the currency in which the ETC Securities are denominated and the currency in which the Metal is quoted. The currency in which the Metal is quoted is known as the ""Metal Currency"". It does this by reflecting the effect of a notional forward sale of the Metal Currency and a corresponding forward purchase of the currency in which the ETC Securities are denominated. The foreign exchange hedge may result in gains or losses to the Issuer. Such gains or losses will result in an increase or decrease in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security and will therefore impact the Value per ETC Security. The Metal Currency for the Series is: U.S. dollar. The foreign exchange hedge is entered into by the Issuer with J.P. Morgan SE as the ""Series Counterparty"". In such role, it enters into a balancing agreement with the Issuer in relation to the ETC Securities (the ""Balancing Agreement"") which provides for deliveries of metal to or by the Issuer to reflect an adjustment for any foreign exchange gain or loss realised by the Issuer. Where there are foreign exchange gains and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security consequently increases, the Series Counterparty will deliver additional Metal equivalent to such increase. Where there are losses and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security consequently decreases, the Issuer will be required to deliver Metal equivalent to such decrease to the Series Counterparty under the Balancing Agreement. All such payments will be in the form of Metal and will settle no later than the second business day after the relevant valuation day. The ETC Securities are subject to a product fee (which comprises a foreign exchange hedging fee) that accrues on a daily basis. Accrued product fee is paid by a daily reduction in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security which, as a result of such reduction, operates as a charge on securityholders. The Issuer will, using the Metal Agent, periodically realise Metal equal to such charge and the proceeds will be credited to the Series Cash Account maintained by the Account Bank in relation to the ETC Securities and used by the Issuer to pay the product fee to the Programme Administrator in accordance with the Programme Administrator Agreement. Such realisation will happen on a periodic (typically weekly) basis. The Programme Administrator Agreement provides that the Programme Administrator will use the product fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities to pay on behalf of the Issuer the costs of the Programme (as set out in the schedule to the Programme Administrator Agreement) relating to such Series of ETC Securities and the Issuer more generally. The ETC Securities may become due and payable prior to their Scheduled Maturity Date in connection with the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) certain legal or regulatory changes occur in relation to the Issuer and the Issuer gives a notice of redemption; (ii) the Balancing Agreement is terminated in connection with an event of default, a termination event or the valid delivery of an optional termination notice under such Balancing Agreement (and to the extent the optional termination notice is delivered by the Series Counterparty, no replacement is put in place (as discussed further below under ""Optional Termination"")); (iii) any agent in relation to the ETC Securities resigns or their appointment is terminated and the Issuer gives notice that no successor or replacement has been appointed within a 60 calendar day period; (iv) the Value per ETC Security is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price as at the series issue date for two consecutive valuation days and the determination agent gives the relevant notice; (v) the Issuer will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, be required to make a payment in respect of VAT or be required to account for VAT in respect of a delivery of Metal from or to an authorised participant (whether or not such VAT is recoverable); (vi) an Issuer Call Redemption Event occurs (as discussed further below under ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""); (vii) the Issuer becomes entitled to serve a VAT redemption event notice or a termination notice under the Balancing Agreement following a tax event or illegality under the Balancing Agreement and the Trustee gives the relevant notice as directed by the requisite number of securityholders; or (viii) an event of default occurs under the ETC Securities. These include certain breaches by the Issuer of its obligations that are not cured within the applicable cure period and certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer. The Issuer may elect to redeem the ETC Securities early on giving not less than 30 calendar days' notice to securityholders (an ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""). The Issuer or the Series Counterparty may, on giving not less than 30 calendar days' prior notice, terminate the Balancing Agreement. Termination of the Balancing Agreement may result in an early redemption of the ETC Securities if such notice is given by the Issuer, or, in respect of an optional termination notice validly delivered by the Series Counterparty, a replacement Series Counterparty is not appointed within the time specified the terms and conditions. The ETC Securities will rank equally amongst themselves. The rights of securityholders are limited in recourse to the Secured Property. As such, once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed, none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors, officers, members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and, therefore, the rights of securityholders will rank in accordance therewith. As a result of such provisions, the securityholders may not receive in full the final redemption amount or early redemption amount payable in respect of an ETC Security. All payments in respect of the ETC Securities shall be made net of and after allowance for any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes. In the event that any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes applies to payments in respect of the ETC Securities, securityholders will be subject to such tax or deduction and shall not be entitled to receive amounts to compensate for any such tax or deduction. No event of default will occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction. The ETC Securities will be governed by the laws of Ireland. There will be two security deeds relating to the ETC Securities; one will be governed by the laws of Ireland and the other will be governed by English law.

· The amount payable in respect of the ETC Securities is linked to the performance of the underlying Metal. Prices of precious metals are generally more volatile than prices in other asset classes. If the value of such underlying Metal falls, that will reduce amounts payable in respect of the ETC Securities. · The Value per ETC Security, secondary market price and the redemption amount of ETC Securities will primarily be affected by the performance and level of the underlying Metal, rate movements, market perception, the performance and price of foreign exchange futures contracts, the creditworthiness of the Metal Agent and the Series Counterparty, the creditworthiness of the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian and any applicable sub-custodian and liquidity in the ETC Securities. · The foreign exchange hedge does not fully eliminate exchange rate risks or fluctuations and, depending on movements in exchange rates, such currency hedging might have a negative impact on the Value per ETC Security. · The securityholders and other transaction parties will have recourse only to the Secured Property in respect of the ETC Securities and not to any other assets of the Issuer. If, following realisation in full of the Secured Property relating to the ETC Securities, any outstanding claim remains unpaid, then such claim will be extinguished and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect thereof. · The Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is subject to the deduction of the product fee and to any gains or losses incurred by the Issuer in connection with the foreign exchange hedging component. · The Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount (if any) operates as a minimum repayment amount on the early or final redemption of the ETC Securities. However, in the event that the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is insufficient to fund the Minimum Debt Principal Amount payable in respect of each ETC Security to all securityholders on such early or final redemption, such securityholders may not receive payment of the Minimum Debt Principal Amount in full and may receive substantially less. · The Issuer and securityholders are exposed to the credit risk of the Metal Agent, the Programme Administrator (defined below), the Series Counterparty, the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian, the Account Bank, and any sub-custodian and the authorised participants. · Any disruption to a price source or relevant association may affect the Value per ETC Security and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security. · Certain events may lead to an early redemption of the ETC Securities. · ETC Securities may have a long term and the only means through which an investor can realise value from an ETC Security prior to its Scheduled Maturity Date is to sell it at its then market price in a secondary market transaction. While each authorised participant may make a market for the ETC Securities, no authorised participant is obliged to make a market for any series of ETC Securities and an authorised participant may discontinue making a market at any time. Furthermore, any market in ETC Securities may not be liquid and the secondary market price (if any) for ETC Securities may be substantially less than the price paid by the investor. · With respect to any redemption disposal period, if the proceeds from the realisation of the underlying Metal would cause the balance standing to the Series Cash Account to exceed the maximum amount that can be held during the period between December and January of each calendar year (such amount and such period to be agreed from time to time between the Issuer, the Programme Administrator and the Account Bank (the ""Year-End Period"")), then the Programme Administrator may postpone the redemption date until after the Year-End Period, during which time the Metal Agent will not deposit such proceeds into the Series Cash Account and interest equal to the Specified Interest Amount will not accrue on such proceeds for so long as they are not deposited into the Series Cash Account.

The European Union state has overestimated its revenue target for the year and will overshoot a deficit target of 4.4% of gross domestic product by a little over one percentage point.

Earlier this month, the European Commission warned Romania would overshoot fiscal deficit targets through 2025, with more pressure on state finances coming from a recently approved pension law and planned hikes in the upcoming election year.

""The latest period has been more agitated from the perspective of this legislation and it generated a lot of talk about long term benefits versus the short term impact on deficits,"" debt chief Stefan Nanu told a financial seminar organized by online publication www.profit.ro.

""We secured an internal approval to raise the funding programme, to be able to prepare for next year.""

1142741121,20231127,"(MENAFN) Switzerland has come under scrutiny after importing over 14 tons of gold from Russia last month for processing, exploiting a loophole that allows the precious metal to be shipped through third countries, thereby bypassing Western sanctions. The latest data from the Swiss Federal Council revealed that in October, the Alpine nation imported a total of CHF 776 million (USD879 million) worth of gold, with USD875.7 million originating from Russia. Importantly, the gold was delivered through the United Kingdom and Moldova, avoiding direct violations of the sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU).

 

 Switzerland, known as a major global hub for processing gold, had joined the European Union's seventh package of Ukraine-related restrictions in August 2022. This package included a ban on the ""direct or indirect purchase, import, or transfer of gold and gold jewelry"" from Russia, extending to exports from Russia to the European Union. The sanctions also targeted exports of gold items processed in a third country. However, Swiss regulations stipulate that gold produced in Russia before the embargo is not subject to sanctions, allowing the legal importation of the commodity from third countries.

 

 The revelation of Switzerland's gold imports from Russia has reignited concerns over the effectiveness of international sanctions and the ability of countries to exploit legal loopholes. 

 

 The questions surrounding the sourcing of gold by Switzerland have gained significant media and public attention, with some outlets highlighting the apparent minimal impact of the European Union ban on Swiss imports of Russian gold. Swiss refineries are reportedly continuing to purchase and re-melt the metal, making it challenging to trace its origin and raising questions about the broader enforcement and impact of sanctions on Russia.

 

 As geopolitical tensions persist and sanctions remain a key tool in shaping international responses, the case of Swiss gold imports underscores the complexities and challenges of implementing effective restrictions. The incident raises broader questions about the need for more comprehensive and robust measures to prevent the circumvention of sanctions, ensuring that intended restrictions are not undermined by legal nuances and loopholes."

In a June 2021 poll, a slight majority of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 had a favorable view of socialism, suggesting that younger generations in Western democracies are increasingly open to alternative systems of governance. All this is a call for action. Foreign Policy brought together 10 prominent thinkers to share their most important fixes to reform the workings of democracy, defend it against its enemies at home and abroad, and ensure it survives and thrives by better serving the people it governs. Several themes emerge. The most urgent fixes obviously begin at home, starting with ways to lessen the inequities of 21st-century capitalism. Technology is an urgent field for policy action, as the toxic discourse abetted by social media and the dangers of hacking, spyware, surveillance, and disinformation demonstrate. Following a year that saw a nationalist insurrection in the United States and the continued strength of anti-immigrant populists in Europe, several of our contributors focus on how racial and other social divisions might be addressed. And in light of the growing conflict between democratic and autocratic powers, it’s no surprise that better defenses against external threats—from weaponized corruption to election interference—rank high among the writers’ concerns as well. We asked the participants to be as prescriptive and radical as possible. Their responses show that the task is huge and the fixes are tentative at best. Perhaps the one thing missing from the debate is a call to stop acting as if democracy were doomed. It might help to recall that the history of democracy fatigue is as old as democracy itself: In 1787, Benjamin Franklin predicted that the American republic would soon end in despotism, “when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government, being incapable of any other.” History went on to tell another story. Despite its well-documented flaws and constant need for reinvention, liberal democracy has brought civil rights, political participation, social mobility, and economic opportunity to once-disenfranchised masses and minorities. Around the world, poor and autocratic countries might gladly take Moscow’s mercenaries and Beijing’s money, but it’s still Western-style democracy to which their citizens aspire. As Anders Fogh Rasmussen writes in this issue, “People rarely take to the streets demanding more autocracy.” A little more confidence could go a long way as democracy writes its next chapter.—Stefan Theil, deputy editor

By Lee Drutman, senior fellow at New America One cannot make sense of the current crisis of liberal democracy without understanding the seismic economic and demographic shifts that have transformed Western democracies. Today, economic opportunity is heavily concentrated in major cities. A new urban elite—much more multicultural, diverse, and cosmopolitan—is redefining cultural norms and rearranging traditional hierarchies of race and gender. Left behind are those who stayed in the rural and post-industrial hinterlands, where globalization has not been kind. Here, far-right populists recasting themselves as defenders of national greatness and a bygone order have flourished, especially among white men. The leaders of such movements are cold to the traditional values of liberal democracy, with its emphasis on diversity and tolerance and its embrace of a market capitalism that has hit these regions hardest. In the United States and Britain, Trumpism and Brexit are both clear manifestations and fierce accelerators of a dangerous us-versus-them divide that is hitting right at the heart of liberal democracy. Other countries have been spared such shocks. Nationalist or far-right parties such as Alternative for Germany, the Sweden Democrats, the Dutch Party for Freedom, and the Danish People’s Party have galvanized voters in their countries’ left-behind regions. But so far, they’ve been kept out of government, rejected by at least three-quarters of voters. The difference? The United States and Britain have first-past-the-post elections, which organize conflict around just two parties and force voters into two competing camps. Though the Brexit referendum didn’t perfectly map onto the Labour-Conservative divide at the time, it accelerated a divisive polarization that now defines British partisan politics. In an earlier period, when national politics in most Western countries was dominated by a large moderate center, two-party and multiparty systems proved equally adept in holding together a rough national consensus. But today, with urban-rural cultural conflicts driving political competition, majoritarian democracies are amplifying and escalating the zero-sum fights between progressive urban elites and a resentment-driven rural populist right, with no release valve or opportunity for a new center to emerge. Voting reform can help. The proportional democracies of northern Europe, after all, are more effectively riding out the storms of authoritarian populism. There, center-right voters have been able to support center-right parties without supporting illiberalism, and more flexible multiparty systems have facilitated new coalitions to keep illiberal forces out of power. The idea of introducing proportional representation in the United States and Britain is hardly new. What’s new is the context. Cultural, educational, and geographic divides are likely to shape politics for decades to come. A two-party system that by definition splits a country in half will reinforce and deepen identity polarization, pushing national politics even further into trench warfare. Proportional systems are far from perfect. But they allow for new and shifting coalitions that can help liberal democracies navigate these difficult circumstances. Most importantly, they avoid the binary winner-take-all conflict that so easily lets politics slip into an irresolvable zero-sum contest of us against them—a toxic polarization that even long-established democracies such as the United States and Britain may not survive.

By Shoshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power Surveillance capitalism is the dominant economic institution of our time, and it is on a collision course with democracy. Surveillance capitalism’s giants—Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple—now own, operate, and intermediate nearly every aspect of human engagement with global information and communication systems, unconstrained by public law. All roads to economic, social, and even political participation now lead through a handful of unaccountable companies, a condition that has intensified during two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The result is a trail of social wreckage: the wholesale destruction of privacy, vast corporate concentrations of information about people and society, poisoned discourse, fractured societies, remote systems of behavior manipulation, and weakened democratic institutions. While the Chinese designed and deployed digital technologies to advance their own system of authoritarian rule, the West failed to construct a coherent vision of a digital century that advances democratic principles and government. Rights and laws once codified to protect citizens from industrial capitalism—such as antitrust law and workers’ rights—do not shield us from these harms. If the ideal of the people’s self-governance is to survive this century, then a democratic counterrevolution is the only solution. U.S. and European lawmakers have finally begun to think seriously about regulating privacy and content, but they have yet to reckon with the far more basic question of how to structure and govern information and communication for a democratic digital future. Three principles offer a starting point. First, the democratic rule of law governs. There is no so-called cyberspace immune to rights and laws, which must apply to every domain of society, whether populated by people or machines. Publishers, for example, are held accountable for the information they publish. Surveillance capitalists have no such accountability, even though their profit-maximizing algorithms enable and exploit disinformation. Second, unprecedented harms demand unprecedented solutions. Existing antitrust laws can be used to break up the tech giants, but that won’t address the underlying economics. The target must be the secret extraction of human data once considered private. Democracies must outlaw this extraction, end the corporate concentration of personal information, eliminate targeting algorithms, and abolish corporate control of information flows. Third, new conditions require new rights. Our era demands the codification of epistemic rights—the right to know and decide who knows what about our lives. These elemental rights are not codified in law because they have never before come under systemic threat. They must be codified if they are to exist at all. We can be a surveillance society, or we can be a democracy—but we cannot be both. Democracy is a fragile political condition dedicated to the prospect of self-governance, sheltered by the principle of justice, and maintained by collective effort. Each generation’s mission is always the same: to protect and keep democracy moving forward in a relay race against anti-democratic forces that spans centuries. The liberal democracies have the power and legitimacy to lead against surveillance capitalism—and to do so on behalf of all peoples struggling against a dystopian future.

By Eduardo Porter, economics reporter at the New York Times The most insidious threat to Western liberal democracies doesn’t come from China or Russia but from within: from the dread their white majorities feel as demographic change puts their grip on power at risk. The urge of white, Christian native populations to circle the wagons against Black and other racial minorities and increasingly non-Christian immigrants has fueled illiberal politics from the United States to Europe, opening the door to autocratic politicians who promise to protect the volk. This presents a particularly complicated challenge for the liberal order because demographic change will not be stopped. In the United States, the non-Hispanic white population will slip into minority status in a couple of decades—regardless of future immigration trends. Immigration to Western Europe is increasing despite all efforts to keep outsiders at bay. Saving liberal democracy, given this inexorable demographic reconfiguration, requires that we build a sense of shared citizenship that can survive the reallocation of power. This is highly improbable. In the United States, the most ethnically diverse of the Western democracies, the debate over the nation’s racial divisions has no center. The left demands redress from white people for the centuries of oppression that various groups have faced. The right doesn’t believe those groups have a legitimate claim. Communities of color in European countries may benefit from their more robust social safety nets. But immigrants’ claim on public goods is resented, and their claim to broader citizenship and belonging are flatly denied. It is easier to identify pitfalls than to propose an effective way out. The anti-racism proposed by some activists on the U.S. left is divisive by design—cleaving the nation into antagonistic racist and anti-racist camps. The demand for reparations to be paid to the descendants of enslaved people, moral though it may be, is equally contentious. Clearly, building a more cohesive nation requires reducing the United States’ gargantuan inequalities of income and wealth. But imagine how a $10 trillion reparations bill would shape the politics of the 63 million non-Hispanic white people who voted for then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020, many of whom perceive themselves under threat by their country’s racial transformation. Those 63 million American voters—like the millions of voters for Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France, the Dutch Party for Freedom, or the Sweden Democrats—must be part of the conversation. Liberal democracy cannot be saved without finding better ways to include the angry citizens threatening to bring it down. How do we do that? Policies to counter residential segregation, including incentives to build affordable housing in gentrifying neighborhoods, would help. So would efforts to integrate schools that have become increasingly segregated by race and class. A program of national service requiring every 18-year-old to work on community projects and build public goods could mix young people from all backgrounds and help start urgently needed conversations across identity frontiers. The broader objective is to build an inclusive citizenship. Living next to each other, going to school together, and sharing the granular challenges of life are just a few ways to start to humanize each other.

By Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former NATO secretary-general and CEO of Rasmussen Global In the free world, national debates are blinding us to the great challenge faced by democracies everywhere: Liberal democracy is in decline around the world, and autocrats are feeling increasingly emboldened. That need not be the case. The world’s democracies represent more than 70 percent of global GDP. If that power is leveraged, that’s a language Beijing and Moscow will understand. But above all, we know that the force of human freedom is the most powerful force in the world. People rarely take to the streets demanding more autocracy. U.S. President Joe Biden’s Summit for Democracy should not remain a one-off event. Instead, it should kick-start a broader campaign for democratic renewal and optimism. The aim is to unite the free world in the broader cause of preventing democratic backsliding at home and combating the divide-and-rule tactics by autocracies abroad. For this, our current set of global institutions are insufficient. Take the United Nations: While it does much good, the interests of democracies are routinely blocked by autocracies and their friends in the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, and other U.N. bodies. Even in a bloc of democratic nations such as the European Union, collective decisions are often vetoed by member states in thrall to China and Russia or sliding toward authoritarianism themselves. What the free world needs if democracy is to thrive at home and abroad is a coalition of the willing—a formal alliance among like-minded nations. Such an alliance could be an extension of the G-7, the group of leading industrialized democracies that was informally expanded in 2021 to include Australia, India, South Africa, and South Korea. Such an alliance will only work if it focuses its attention not just on summits and declarations but also on concrete outputs. In particular, two key challenges are urgent and existential for all democracies: economic coercion and emerging technologies. China, especially, has been using strategic investments and economic coercion as weapons to silence or undermine democratic states. Massive sanctions have been applied for the mere act of speaking out against Beijing, such as those against Australia after Canberra called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19. An alliance of democracies could develop an economic version of the mutual assistance clause, Article 5, in NATO’s founding treaty: When one country came under economic attack from an autocracy, the democratic world could rally with retaliatory steps to deter the aggressor, credit lines to cushion the impact, and a quick rebuilding of new democratic supply chains. We also face a global race not only to develop new technology but also to define the norms and standards under which these new technologies operate—including, for example, whether citizens’ rights are protected in the emerging digital world. Among democracies, attempts to regulate technologies remain fragmented as each country follows its own approach. If that fragmentation continues, China could win the technology race and forge the terms in the image of a surveillance dictatorship. An alliance of democracies should unite to build common solutions, agree on principles for data flows and protection, find a common vision for the development of artificial intelligence and other life-changing technologies, and construct standards that give democratic states an edge over the autocrats. Beyond these immediate challenges, an alliance of democracies needs to show emerging or backsliding democracies that being in the democratic camp has real benefits, from trade access to economic development support. Democracy will not be on the front foot again until the world’s leading democracies show that being in their club is far more advantageous than what the autocracies have on offer.

To Secure Democracy, Face Up to the Past By Anne-Marie Slaughter, CEO of New America and author of Renewal: From Crisis to Transformation in Our Lives, Work, and Politics A crucial yet often overlooked characteristic of healthy liberal democracies is the ability of a government to accept criticism. Can it accept critiques not only of its own performance but also of the country’s past misdeeds? Dictators typically erase the past and create new narratives and monuments aimed at their own glorification. But democracies, too, have ignored dark chapters of their history, inviting polarization and radicalization as social evils fester and old wounds don’t heal. The strongest democracies can stare their pasts in the face and accept their horrors and triumphs alike. Berlin has a powerful and sobering memorial to the Holocaust. Washington has museums on the National Mall dedicated to Native Americans and to African Americans, both of which tell the tale of some of the very worst parts of U.S. history. Cambodia has the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, documenting Pol Pot’s killing fields. Australia and Canada are both coming to grips with their despoliation and killing of Indigenous populations with various forms of acknowledgment and commemoration. At U.S. President Joe Biden’s Summit for Democracy in December, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda reminded us that democracy is based on competition, which often leads to conflict. Democratic resilience, however, depends on the ability of democratic institutions to resolve that conflict. Effective conflict resolution, in turn, depends in part on being able to acknowledge the ways in which democracy is failing specific groups, often ethnic, racial, and other minorities. Moreover, civil society organizations and the media—indispensable elements of strong democracies—must be able to speak truth to power. If governments will not listen, then citizens can and will mobilize accordingly. No country has a clean past. But governments differ radically in how willing they are to allow their country’s history to be told from the perspective of all the people they govern. Let that acceptance, which in turn requires more conventional liberal democratic attributes such as freedom of speech and the press, be one of the measures of democratic strength. Indeed, evidence of a willingness to face up to the past could be one of the criteria for participation in the next Summit for Democracy.

By Josh Rudolph, fellow for malign finance at the Alliance for Securing Democracy In 2013 and 2014, respectively, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin began to authorize campaigns of strategic corruption that have taken the threat to democracies to a whole new level. Russian oligarchs close to Putin now regularly deploy their corruptly acquired wealth to influence Western elections, coerce public officials, and undermine democratic processes. Xi launched the Belt and Road Initiative, which uses opaque investments and outright bribery in what has traditionally been the most corrupt sector of industry—large-scale infrastructure projects—to spread Beijing’s model of authoritarian governance and poison struggling democracies. Confronting this challenge would require Western governments to dig deep into their own sectors that move and hide this dirty money, from legal services to real estate. They must not only rewrite entire sets of laws but also enforce a radical transparency in politics and business that is bound to be deeply uncomfortable to those in the West who profit from corrupt cash or turn a blind eye. Washington has recently taken some long-overdue steps in the right direction, such as outlawing anonymous shell companies, and is starting to look at regulating realtors and other professional enablers. Announcing new agendas and legislative tinkering at the edges isn’t enough—the rules must be radically expanded and strongly enforced. Not just the United States but every major democracy must take this course. A key obstacle to action is that illicit money flows have become entrenched in many democracies. In Britain, the role of foreign oligarchs as major political donors and lucrative clients of financial and other services has made significant anti-corruption reform all but impossible. Under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Conservative Party appears to have become an intake valve for dirty money from Russia and elsewhere; coincidentally or not, the British government has also put the brakes on legislation and enforcement aimed at foreign corruption. Remedies have been proposed countless times, yet little has happened. Now that corruption has become a top national security threat, rather than a fringe agenda pushed by do-good reformers, it is time to call out the foot-dragging as itself corrupt or potentially treasonous. That may sound harsh, but if Western governments aren’t willing to cut off corrupt money flows, from which too many in their countries profit, their democracies will continue to wither and may ultimately die.

By Yascha Mounk, founder and editor in chief of Persuasion To thrive, liberal democracies need to adopt policies that offer economic prosperity to more of their citizens. They need to embrace a more ambitious vision of diversity by promising all citizens—majority and minority—social respect and a place at the table. They need to fix their institutions, reinvigorate attachment to their founding ideals, and stand up to autocratic bullies. It is a vast undertaking. Most countries do not seem close to taking on the challenge. The temptation to despair is strong. And so, as a first step, I’d like to propose something more modest: a cease-fire. One of the reasons why authoritarian populists have a real shot at winning democratic elections is that many voters feel they are on the receiving end of a culture war in which the most powerful elements of their own societies look down on them. They intuit, not entirely without reason, that many politicians, journalists, corporate leaders, and university professors have instinctive disdain for what then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump called “the poorly educated.” And they can see that some establishment institutions—universities and schools, the media, corporations—have, in recent years, embarked on an ambitious project of social transformation to eradicate what they consider the backward elements of their countries’ culture. But in a democracy where every adult has a vote, this is a victory that cannot be won top down. And so the elite—the kind of people who read and write for Foreign Policy—should propose an armistice. If we try to like our own compatriots again, if we trust that most people are mainly motivated by reasonable concerns, and if our political and cultural institutions no longer treat them like barbarians at the gates, then we might have a chance to return to some kind of social peace. And that might just help us resist authoritarian populists in the best possible way: by beating them at the ballot box.

Democratic countries will continue to be undermined as long as they don’t clamp down on the commercial market for intelligence-grade software and other technologies. Spy and hacking systems threaten the free press, freedom of expression, and the right to privacy. They help criminal networks, malignant state actors, and power-seeking oligarchs intimidate public officials, candidates for office, journalists, NGOs, think tanks, universities, and companies. Anyone with money can easily purchase top-notch intelligence capacities on a toxic yet unregulated market. Few other services so directly undermine democratic governments, but their credibility is at stake as well: After all, what is the value of beautiful declarations at democracy summits when companies in democratic countries are key enablers of tyranny? Right now, many of the victims of these technologies live under repressive regimes far away from the places where the systems were built: Israel, the United States, and Europe. From the hearts of democratic states, the tools for repression are shipped the world over. But who is to say these technologies won’t soon be wielded against democratic societies on the same scale as in autocratic countries? Already, the powerful Pegasus spyware sold by Israel’s NSO Group has been found on the mobile phones of U.S. State Department employees and other Western targets. Waiting for a full-scale attack—perhaps using similarly aggressive systems produced by China, Russia, Turkey, or the United Arab Emirates—means it will be too late to develop rules to curb technologies whose sole purpose is to violate human rights, even if they are marketed as counterterrorism solutions. Accountability about the technologies that undermine democracy everywhere is urgent. Hacking and spyware systems may be the most flagrant in their harmful impact, but they are certainly not the only ones. Mass surveillance through facial recognition, voice and emotion recognition, and ever more systematic tracking of physical and virtual activity is another frontier in the battle between freedom and repression where some of the most prominent Western corporations play key roles as enablers of tyranny. Democracies must act now to bring democracy-undermining technologies in check if they have any interest in the survival of democratic principles in the digital age.

By Toomas Hendrik Ilves, former president of Estonia Democratic countries haven’t even begun to get serious about attacks on their information infrastructure by authoritarian governments: hacking, doxxing, and disinformation. The same two Russian hacking groups have infiltrated the U.S. Congress, the U.S. State and Defense departments, the Democratic National Committee, the German Bundestag and party think tanks, the Danish and Italian foreign ministries, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and many other targets. In addition, Russia has launched disinformation campaigns to influence elections and referendums—in favor of Brexit; against U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, French President Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor candidate and now Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, and the Dutch vote on the European Union’s association agreement with Ukraine, to take just a few prominent examples. Russian state media organizations and state-linked accounts have inundated social media in Western countries with homophobic, antisemitic, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-vaccination, pro-separatist, anti-NATO, anti-fracking, and many other kinds of disinformation. The jury is still out on whether Russian efforts helped tip the scales in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. What’s certain is that a foreign power played a significant role in the election, something a democracy cannot allow. The problem is that we have not addressed this as a broader threat to democracies, ignoring that the sources of the hacking, doxxing, and disinformation are limited to a small group of autocratic states, primarily Russia, China, and Iran. In addressing this well-known and by no means new threat, most democracies face two problems: First, a frozen, siloed bureaucracy that lacks interdisciplinary and interagency collaboration and cooperation. Here lies the first urgent need for change. Adversaries use multiple digital attack vectors and easily combine them. Every democracy must recognize this and establish silo-crossing agencies that can address the whole problem and coordinate a rapid response. Second, what efforts exist remain strictly national, with only halfhearted information-sharing across borders. Clearly, when hacking attacks and disinformation campaigns all trace back to the same few sources, democracies need to cooperate instead of standing alone. Strategies to cope with cross-border threats require serious cross-border cooperation among democracies. When a hacking attempt or a disinformation campaign is identified, other democracies need to be informed and a common information pool—preferably a common response—forged. Today’s primary multilateral democratic institutions, NATO and the EU, are hampered by a restricted mandate and lack coherent policies. As a result, they only do the bare minimum. What’s more, a multilateral digital defense must be genuinely values-based. Unlike NATO and the EU, it should come with a strict mechanism whereby countries backsliding from democracy lose their digital security umbrella. This is the only way we can counter attempts to undermine what we hold so dear.

By Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS and columnist for the Washington Post Almost 25 years ago, I began to notice a disturbing trend in fledgling democracies. Countries in the former Soviet empire and elsewhere were holding elections, leaders were gaining power with considerable popular support—but these leaders were then acting in ways that undermined liberal democracy. They would intimidate the opposition and free press, bypass institutions and laws, and rule by executive fiat or decree. Sometimes these moves went unnoticed; often they were popular. To describe this combination—a regime with popular support and participation that was eroding the constitutional and legal structures of good government—I coined the term “illiberal democracy.” It captured the current dilemma but also the historical reality that there have been two processes of political modernization. One process involves popular participation in politics through elections—democracy. But there has been another, deeper, and longer tradition of liberalism, which began with the Magna Carta in 1215 and aims at restraining the arbitrary power of the state to create space for individual liberty and autonomy. Britain was the most liberal state in Europe in the mid-19th century, when less than 10 percent of its population was allowed to vote. The two traditions merged quite recently in the Western world, creating liberal democracy. But the two had been historically distinct for many years. At the time, illiberal democracies had taken hold in Russia, the Philippines, and Pakistan. I worried about the danger spreading to the West but in a much more low-key fashion. In my book The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, I devoted several chapters to the United States, describing populist tendencies that were reshaping U.S. politics, culture, and society—such as the decline of political parties and the rise of political entrepreneurs unconstrained by party tradition and history. But I have to confess that I regarded these as slow and shallow trends eroding the strength and vitality of the country, not threatening its fundamental character. Today, however, it’s clear that the United States faces a serious threat to its political system—one in some ways more profound than any since the Civil War. To put it simply, large parts of the U.S. electorate, mostly centered in the Republican Party, no longer accept the idea of a legitimate opposition and have convinced themselves that if that opposition wins, it is by fraud and that the election is thus null and void. This kind of mentality is fundamentally opposed to liberal democracy and dangerous to its survival. It suggests the future will be filled with contested elections, efforts to suppress votes, and fights to overturn elections. Even if they fail, as happened in 2020, the lasting effect will be to delegitimize the elected president and paralyze the political system. How did we get here so quickly? There is much study needed for the rise and deepening of U.S. partisanship, which is now as much a cultural as a political divide. But what has struck me has been the inadequacy of one of the core ideas of the American founding. James Madison, the most important architect of the U.S. political system, was deeply enamored by the Enlightenment thinkers who saw politics as a science. They imagined a system of checks and balances producing good government almost as a machine with wheels and pulleys could produce motion or transfer energy. They did not expect people to be wise or virtuous. “If men were angels,” Madison famously wrote in the Federalist Papers, “no government would be necessary.” Madison built a system, he believed, that did not require virtue to function. “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition,” he urged, and from this conflict of interest would come ordered liberty and democracy. This American model became the template for much of the world. In the United States and around the world, we are now witnessing experiments in politics without angels—and they aren’t working so well. Democratic institutions have weakened in many places, broken in others, and feel under stress where they are still functioning. Those countries that have not faced the full furies of populism and nationalism—Germany and Japan are the most striking examples—have escaped these dangers more because of their culture and history rather than some better democratic design. Everywhere, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s truth seems to hold: Institutions are merely lengthened shadows of men. If such men fail and act badly, venally, or irresponsibly, the democratic system is imperiled. We enter the 21st century asking one of the oldest questions in politics, much older than the Enlightenment ideas that democracy was built on. It is a question the ancient Greeks and Romans debated more than two millennia ago: How do we produce virtue in human beings?"

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary should abandon its proposed 'sovereignty' law as it gives sweeping investigative powers with little democratic oversight, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights said on Monday.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz party submitted a ""sovereignty protection bill"" to parliament last week, aiming to set up an authority to monitor political interference and recommend changes in regulations.

Critics say the bill is an attempt to stifle dissent in a country that has clashed repeatedly with the European Union over democratic rights during Orban's 13 years in power.

The bill -- which needs to be debated by lawmakers before its final approval -- would punish foreign financing for parties or groups running for election with up to three years in prison.

""I call on the Hungarian Parliament to shelve these proposals"", Dunja Mijatovic's statement read. Ruling party Fidesz did not reply immediately to emailed questions.

The Council of Europe is a pan-European group tasked with upholding human rights and the rule of law since its formation after World War Two.

Mijatovic said the bill would allow the new authority to request sensitive data and private information from anyone without adequate oversight.

""The invasive scrutiny of the proposed Office could be weaponised against anybody who may be considered an adversary due, for instance, to activities aimed at influencing democratic debate,"" she said.

Orban, who has a two-thirds majority in parliament that allows Fidesz to change any legislation, scored his fourth landslide victory in 2022, portraying himself as a defender of Hungary's national interests."

1142747663,20231127,"The Netherlands' name reflects its low-lying topography, with more than a quarter of its total area under sea level.

Now a constitutional monarchy, the country began its independent life as a republic in the 16th Century, during a long struggle with Hapsburg Spain, when the foundations were laid for it to become one of the world's foremost maritime trading nations.

Although traditionally among the keener advocates of the European Union, Dutch voters echoed those in France by spurning the proposed EU constitution in a 2005 referendum.

The Netherlands has produced many of the world's most famous artists from Rembrandt and Vermeer in the 17th Century to Van Gogh in the 19th and Mondrian in the 20th. It attracts visitors from across the globe.

The Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of four countries, Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the Netherlands - which comprises some 98% of the Kingdom's land area and population and administers most of its affairs.

King Willem-Alexander became the first Dutch male monarch in more than a century in April 2013 when his mother Beatrix abdicated to end a 33-year reign.

The generational change in the House of Orange-Nassau gave the Netherlands a moment of celebration and pageantry at a time of recession brought on by the European economic crisis.

The much-loved Beatrix ended her reign in a nationally televised signing ceremony as thousands of orange-clad people cheered outside. Her retirement followed in the tradition of her mother and grandmother.

Former Prime Minister Mark Rutte is serving as a caretaker leader peending the outcome of talks to form a coalition government following the November 2023 general election. Veteran anti-Islam populist leader Geert Wilders won a dramatic victory when his Freedom party (PVV) became the biggest party in parliament.

Mr Rutte announced his government's resignation in July 2023 when his coalition failed to agree on how to handle increasing migration.

Mr Wilders' win has shaken Dutch politics and has also sent tremors across Europe, but to fulfil his pledge to be ""prime minister for everyone"", he will have to persuade other parties to join him in a coalition. His target is 76 seats in the 150-seat parliament.

The Dutch coalition process tends to take several months.

Centre-right VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz, whose VVD party came third in the vote, has said she would not take part in the next administration because Dutch voters had given a ""clear signal"".

Without the liberals, Mr Wilders will struggle to make up the 76 seats needed to form a majority. The only other major potential partners are the newly formed centrist New Social Contract and the centre-right Farmer Citizens Movement.

The Dutch approach to public broadcasting is unique. Programmes are made by groups which reflect political or religious currents, or other interests. These organisations are allocated airtime on TV and radio, in line with the number of members they have.

Public radio and TV face stiff competition from commercial stations. Viewers have access to a wide range of domestic and foreign channels, thanks mainly to one of the highest cable take-up rates in Europe. Every province has at least one local public TV channel. The three national public TV stations enjoy high audience shares.

Some key dates in the history of the Netherlands:

1396-1467 - Most of what is now the Netherlands and Belgium is eventually united by the Duke of Burgundy, Phillip the Good.

1500-1558 - Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria, King of Spain and Lord of the Netherlands as titular Duke of Burgundy. Born in Ghent he turned rule of the region over to his Spanish relatives.

16th Century - The Protestant Reformation rapidly gains ground in the Netherlands and much of northern Europe. But Charles V and later Philip II consider it a threat to the political system.

c.1566-1648 - The Eighty Years' War or Dutch Revolt. Amid growing resistance to centralised Hapsburg rule, Philip II sends in troops to crush the rebellion and make all the Netherlands Catholic once more.

Spanish troops reconquer the southern Netherlands, now Belgium, but fail to completely suppress the rebels.

1609-1621 - Twelve Years' Truce: facing military stalemate and increasing financial costs, both sides agree to a halt to the fighting.

1621-1648 - Fighting resumes as part of the wider European Thirty Years' War. In 1648 Spain recognises the Dutch Republic, while retaining the southern Netherlands, in the Peace of Münster, part of the Peace of Westphalia.

1652-1674 - As major rivals in world trade and naval power, the Dutch Republic and England fight three naval wars in the 17th Century.

1672 - The ""Disaster Year"" for the Dutch Republic. England declares war (the Third Anglo-Dutch War), followed by France, Münster and Cologne - which then invade. The country's leader, Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis are lynched and a William III is appointed the country's ruler.

1688 - William III invades England at the invitation of Protestant British nobles feuding with the Catholic James II. This leads to the ""Glorious Revolution"" confirming the principle of parliamentary rule and Protestant ascendency in England.

William becomes co-monarch with his wife Mary, James' eldest daughter. This secures England as a critical financial and military ally in the Republic's long-standing wars with Louis XIV of France.

1785-1815 - French-Batavian period: The French Revolution sees first a pro-French Batavian Republic, then the Kingdom of Holland, ruled by a member of the House of Bonaparte, and finally annexation by the French Empire.

1815 - Modern Kingdom of the Netherlands, which includes what is now Belgium and Luxembourg, emerges after the defeat of Napoleonic France.

1839 - Netherlands recognises Belgian independence in the Treaty of London. Luxembourg became a fully independent country.

1914-1918 - The Netherlands maintains its neutrality during World War One.

1932 - A 31km dam is completed across the Zuider Zee forming a freshwater lake known as the Ijsselmeer. Part of the lake has since been drained and the reclaimed land used to grow crops.

1940 - Nazi Germany invades. The Dutch Royal Family flees to England, accompanied by the Dutch cabinet. The Dutch army is overwhelmed and the Netherlands surrenders.

1944 - As Allied forces advance towards Germany, the Netherlands becomes the site of bitter fighting.

1945 - The occupation ends with the surrender of German forces in the Netherlands. The Netherlands goes on to become a charter member of the United Nations.

1948 - Benelux customs union between Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands comes into effect.

1949 - The Dutch East Indies, which had been occupied by Japan during World War Two, becomes independent as Indonesia after a four-year independence struggle against Dutch colonial authorities.

1949 - The Netherlands abandons its policy of neutrality and joins Nato.

1952 - The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Coal and Steel Community, which becomes the European Economic Community five years later in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome.

1963 - Colony of Netherlands New Guinea is ceded to Indonesia.

1975 - Dutch colony of Surinam achieves independence. Hundreds of thousands of Surinamese emigrate to the Netherlands.

Over five hundred delegates have gathered in Somerset West or virtually for presentations elaborating the symposium's topic: where science meets industry.

In his opening address, Schalk Reynolds of the South African Society of Oenology and Viticulture, told attendees: “Climate change will be one of the big things going forward.""

Incidentally, Trautmann remarked, she was on her way to COP-28 in Dubai at the end of the week to represent the Western Cape, a province with a Mediterranean climate, in the signing of a cooperation agreement with Mediterranean regions worldwide on climate mitigation.

The Western Cape will in future doubtless feel the effects of a changing climate, she maintained.

23,000 new jobs for every 5% export increase

Trautmann provided the symposium with a snapshot of the fruit industry in South Africa: 35% of South African exports are fresh fruit.

Of the fruit grown in South Africa, 65% is exported and of that number, over 55% hails from the Western Cape, Trautmann proudly pointed out.

South Africa is the fourth largest table grape exporter in the world and contributes a sizeable amount to the country's export earnings, exporting 63 million 4.5kg cartons last year, two-thirds going to the European Union.

South African grape exports totalling 73 million cartons of grapes are forecast for the new season.

Ilse Trautmann of the Western Cape's department of agriculture

She conceded that South Africa's ports were a major problem and that port capacity had not kept pace with the growth in fruit industry.

International delegates would have noticed the extent of poverty around Cape Town's international airport.

Growth for jobs - G4J - is the first priority of the Western Cape government, Trautmann said.

""In the Cape 430,000 people work in agriculture. For every 5% increase in exports, we can add 23,000 jobs – that’s what we want to do in the Western Cape and in South Africa."""

1142757521,20231127,"Ankara and Moscow are nearing a consensus on establishing a gas hub in the Thrace region, aiming to position Türkiye as a pivotal gas supplier to Europe and facilitate energy exports for producing nations.

The proposal to set up a hub in Türkiye was floated by President Vladimir Putin last year to replace Russia’s lost sales to Europe. At the same time, Ankara has long desired to function as an exchange for energy-starved countries.

The plan came shortly after explosions damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines linking Russia to Germany across the Baltic Sea. It remains unclear who was responsible for the blasts.

Ongoing efforts to identify suitable land in Thrace suggest that the hub could potentially be operational by 2024, according to a report in Sabah on Monday.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak arrived in Türkiye on Friday and discussed the project with his Turkish counterpart Alparslan Bayraktar on the sidelines of the Turkish-Russian Joint Economic Commission meeting.

Novak expressed confidence in reaching an agreement on the hub’s creation in the near future. He said Russia’s Gazprom and Türkiye’s BOTAŞ were cooperating closely and had been discussing the project road map.

“I am sure that agreements on the practical implementation of this project will be reached in the near future,” Novak said in an interview with the TV channel Rossiya 24.

Discussions have not advanced much over recent months, as Türkiye suffered devastating earthquakes in February and focused on elections in May.

Türkiye already boasts an extensive infrastructure featuring natural gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, floating storage regasification units, natural gas storage facilities and a gas exchange market.

Ankara believes it can leverage its existing and new trade relations to become a gas hub.

Bayraktar, in mid-September, said Türkiye plans to expand its gas infrastructure further as it lays the groundwork to establish the gas exchange from which countries in southeast Europe can source gas.

The expansion plans cover infrastructure in northwest Türkiye’s Thrace region, connecting LNG gasification terminals and an upgraded storage facility in Silivri.

Gas coming from Azerbaijan, Iran and Russia through pipelines could also feed into this hub and be priced in a local gas exchange, Bayraktar said.

Moscow currently supplies gas to Türkiye via the Blue Stream and TurkStream pipelines across the Black Sea. Gas via TurkStream also goes for further exports to southern and eastern Europe, including Hungary, Greece, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Romania and Serbia.

Türkiye has said it would also be possible to include the Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP), which carries Azeri natural gas to the Turkish border, into the proposed hub.

Russia supplies pipeline gas to Europe mainly via Ukraine at over 40 million cubic meters per day, less than half the amount it used to sell to the European Union before the Ukraine conflict via that route.

Türkiye is pushing its own gas exporting agenda: BOTAŞ, in August, struck an agreement with Hungary’s MVM to sell about 300 million cubic meters of gas. That marks the first time Türkiye has agreed to gas exports with a non-neighboring country, indicating its willingness to boost the security of the European energy supply.

Putin said in July that the gas hub was still on the agenda, and Russia wanted to set up an electronic platform for gas sales in Türkiye.

Novak emphasized the close collaboration between Russian and Turkish companies on the initiative. He disclosed that the Turkish delegation plans to visit St. Petersburg, indicating that agreements related to the practical implementation of the project are on the horizon.

In his address at the St. Petersburg International Gas Forum earlier this month, Bayraktar affirmed ongoing discussions with Gazprom.

“We are discussing establishing an electronic trade platform, especially with Gazprom and our partners in this project. I believe this will not take a very long time. I hope that we will have established this trading platform within approximately a year,” Bayraktar said."
1142757523,20231127,"There are few indicators that the South China Sea’s seafood rivalry will slow down. Fishermen and the region face a looming fishery crisis due to illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, overfishing, marine pollution, warming seas and the securitization of fisheries.

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a serious global problem that threatens ocean ecosystems and sustainable fisheries. That’s why the European Union (EU) officials continue to monitor Vietnamese fishermen after they received a “yellow card” in 2017. Exporting countries to the EU are categorized and subject to penalties using a color-coded card system; the colors are green, yellow, red, and, in the worst-case situation, a complete halt to trade.

Fortunately, Vietnamese fishing captain Tran Hong Tho, an experienced fisherman and thousands of others, have seen positive improvements in their fisheries management as a result of these EU fines.

This is not to argue that there have not been disputes over fisheries in the disputed South China Sea or East Sea, as the Vietnamese refer to it. However, there are fewer occurrences, which is great news for Tho, considering that in 2017, a Chinese vessel sank his own customary wooden fishing boat. But the news is bad for fish.

Authorities have not yet prevented Vietnamese illegal fishing in neighboring countries’ exclusive economic zones. In 2022, 919 people and 104 Vietnamese fishing boats were detained on suspicion of participating in illegal fishing overseas. Vietnam’s attempts to have its yellow card erased are still being undermined by these violations.

Fish stocks, like the snappers and Spanish mackerel caught in the South China Sea, have been depleted by 70-95 percent since the 1950s according to experts at the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). China consumes half of the world’s seafood, which propels the country’s nearly 5,000-vessel distant-water fleet- the largest in the world- to plunder the ocean.

For the EU and also the U.S., the international regulatory environment requires traceability of imported seafood. This includes fishing ground, fishing time, type of vessels, ports for their departure and return, and compliance with fisheries laws.

Over the past six years, Vietnam has undertaken bold and transparent steps to meet international fishery requirements. This has included enacting the Fisheries Law and the establishment of transparent fishing vessel data covering registration and the proper issuance of fishing licenses.

“Combatting IUU is not just a form of response, but it is for the interests of the nation and people,” says Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. Government officials understand that their certification compliance helps preserve the nation’s image, fulfills international commitments, and affirms Vietnam as a responsible member of the international community.

Hanoi’s political leadership in concert with the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries DG-MARE of EC has prompted Vietnam to make significant gains as a responsible and sustainable fisheries industry.

However, the imposed ‘yellow card’ has led to a consistent decline in overall export sales to the European Union. Statistics from the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP) reveal that in the first nine months of 2023 the total turnover of seafood was $6.6 billion exported to the EU – a decrease of 22 percent on year.

However, according to Enrico Brivio, a spokesman for the EU’s Environment, Marine Affairs, and Fisheries, Vietnam is actively pursuing the implementation of four specific recommendations from the European Commission: bolstering the legal framework; controlling fishing vessel operations; certifying output and tracing exploited aquatic products; and bolstering law enforcement.

Before venturing out into the vast blue sea to catch fish and make sure their counterparts are abiding by fishery laws, fishermen in Ham Ninh hamlet, one of the oldest villages in Vietnam, which is located on the east coast of Phu Quoc island, voluntarily register and obtain licenses to use their fishing vessels.

The fishing community has also established local inspection teams of its own. Every fishing vessel involved in these operations has Zalo communications software installed, enabling them to stay connected and communicate.

This information technology initiative aims to create suitable and effective role models for fishing communities in accordance with regulations, minimizing negative impacts on water environment quality. It does this by combining tradition and application of IT to effectively communicate environmental protection regulations to fishermen and small businesses at the boat dock.

The installation of monitoring and supervisory equipment on over 98% of Vietnam’s offshore fishing vessels has contributed to the nation’s fisheries compliance status. Additionally, the chain of harvesting, processing, and exporting has reflected a course correction on seafood traceability. Furthermore, there has been an 84% decrease in fishing vessel infractions related to trespassing in foreign waters.

Vietnam deserves praise for the openness with which fishery management in at least 28 coastal communities has shared data and information during sporadic inspections by the EU. However, the fact that Vietnamese fishermen are still being arrested in other nations’ exclusive economic zones worries inspectors and local officials.

The E.C. Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (MARE) IUU Fisheries Policy Unit’s Roberto Cesari urged authorities to strive for the implementation of efficient fleet monitoring and to guarantee uniform enforcement from the federal to local levels last year.

However, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) evaluation, states that local too many fishing vessels continue to breach international waterways.

Vietnam needs to decrease its production of marine exploitation in order to get rid of the EC’s “yellow card” for seafood, but it also needs to raise the value of seafood in order to grow its economy and protect the livelihoods of fishermen.

In the wake of the recent APEC 2023 summit, held in San Francisco with the US as acting host, and keeping in mind the agreed upon comprehensive strategic partnership that now exists between the US and Vietnam, it seems that there’s even greater impetus to get the onerous EU ‘yellow card lifted, otherwise there may be restrictions imposed on access to the American market.

There’s reason for optimism since the U.S. Interagency Working Group on IUU Fishing through multiple federal agencies has effectively reached out to targeted countries for collaboration in efforts to combat IUU. Their September visit to Vietnam highlights Vietnam’s willingness to partner in assessing capabilities, identified areas for improvement, and in developing a multi-year plan to strengthen Vietnam’s capacity to address these IUU problems.

Their discussions offered critical and practical areas for collaboration, spanning training, guidance, legal advice and operations. The blueprint for Vietnam is clear: they must reduce marine exploitation, and in the process develop the economy and ensure fishermen’s livelihoods by increasing the value of seafood.

For fisherman like Tho and other fishermen crossing the rough and dangerous waters in their wooden boats, the future may hold a promising safety net below for better and safer fishing.

1142760361,20231127,"BRUSSELS (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will return this week to the Middle East as the U.S. hopes to find a way to extend a cease-fire in Gaza and get more hostages released, the State Department said Monday. It will be his third trip to the region since Israel’s war with Hamas began last month.

Blinken will travel to Israel and the West Bank after attending Ukraine-focused meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday in Brussels and Skopje, North Macedonia, where foreign ministers from NATO and the Organization for Peace and Security in Europe are gathering.

Israel has agreed to pauses in its military operations in exchange for the gradual release of hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. The agreement had been due to expire Monday but was extended for an additional two days, meaning the extension will be expiring just as Blinken is arriving in Israel.

White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday the U.S. hopes to see the pause extended further, but it is dependent on Hamas continuing to release hostages.

In Israel and the West Bank, Blinken will “discuss Israel’s right to defend itself consistent with international humanitarian law, as well as continued efforts to secure the release of remaining hostages, protect civilian life during Israel’s operations in Gaza, and accelerate humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.

He said Blinken also will discuss the principles for a post-conflict Gaza, as well as the need to establish an independent Palestinian state and prevent the conflict from widening.

In the occupied West Bank, Blinken is expected to see Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Blinken and other U.S. officials have said they believe the Palestinian Authority should play a significant role in governing post-conflict Gaza.

From Israel and the West Bank, Blinken will travel to the United Arab Emirates for discussions with regional leaders who will be in Dubai to attend the COP28 climate summit.

Blinken has been engaged in furious diplomacy to try to prevent the Gaza conflict from spreading, expand the provision of humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in the territory, secure the release of hostages and arrange for foreigners and dual nationals to leave Gaza overland to Egypt.

On each of his prior two trips, Blinken has traveled to Israel and Jordan multiple times. Between the two trips, he also made stops in Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE.

Blinken will arrive in Israel having just participated in an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe foreign ministers meeting in Skopje. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said he plans to attend the OSCE meeting, possibly setting the stage for a U.S.-Russia confrontation there over Ukraine.

In Brussels, Blinken will attend the two-day NATO gathering, which will include the first foreign minister-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a body created by alliance leaders at their last summit to improve cooperation and coordination and help prepare Kyiv for eventual membership.

“Allies will continue to support Ukraine’s self-defense until Russia stops its war of aggression,” said Jim O’Brien, the top U.S. diplomat for Europe.

The NATO meeting will also address the tensions in the Western Balkans, where there are calls for NATO to increase its military presence in response to concerns that hostility between Serbia and Kosovo could escalate to outright conflict.

Violence between the two has broken out twice in recent months, and Western countries fear that Russia could try to foment trouble in the Balkans to avert attention from the war in Ukraine.

Last week, Albania’s prime minister urged NATO to further boost its military forces in Kosovo and secure the country’s borders with Serbia, warning that recent ethnic violence in Kosovo could potentially trigger a wider Balkan conflict. NATO has already strengthened its military presence in Kosovo — established after the 1999 bombing campaign against Serbia — with about 1,000 additional troops and heavier weaponry, bringing its deployment there to about 4,500 troops.

Blinken will underscore U.S. and NATO support for democracy and stability in the region, including a commitment to back all countries’ aspirations to join the European Union, O’Brien said.

Serbia doesn’t recognize Kosovo’s formal declaration of independence in 2008. Both countries want to join the European Union, which is mediating a dialogue between the former foes. Brussels has warned both that refusal to compromise jeopardizes their chances of joining the bloc.

The NATO ministers will also discuss plans for the alliance’s 75th anniversary summit to be held in Washington in July 2024."
1142770740,20231127,"Egyptian, Qatari and U.S. negotiators closed in on an extension of a four-day truce in Gaza that expires on Monday, Egyptian security sources said, amid rising international pressure to roll over a deal which has paused seven weeks of fighting.

Palestinian group Hamas is seeking a four-day extension while Israel wants day-by-day extensions, with negotiations continuing over which Palestinian prisoners would be freed, the sources said.

An Israeli official earlier reiterated Israel's position that it would agree to an extra day of truce for each additional 10 hostages freed and to release three times the number of Palestinians each time. The number of additional days is capped at five, the official added.

A Palestinian official, familiar with the truce talks, said both Hamas and Israel had shown a positive attitude to requests to extend the pause in fighting, but added that ""a final decision hasn't yet been reached"".

On Sunday, Hamas freed 17 people, including a 4-year-old Israeli-American girl, bringing the total number the militant group has released since Friday to 58, including foreigners. Israel freed 39 teenage Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, taking the total number of Palestinians freed under the truce to 117.

Under the terms of the current deal, Hamas is due to release in total 50 Israeli women and children held hostage in Gaza, which means that 11 remained to be freed on Monday. There is no limit in the deal on the number of foreigners it can release.

An Israeli government spokesperson said on Monday that the total number of hostages still held in Gaza was now 184, including 14 foreigners and 80 Israelis with dual nationality.

Both Israel and Hamas raised concerns over Monday's lists and Qatari mediators were working with them to resolve the issues and avoid delays, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it was reviewing the list of Palestinian prisoners it had received from Hamas for release on Monday and would provide further information when possible.

Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan, speaking to Lebanon's LBC broadcaster, said the group would try to find more hostages to release and thus prolong the truce. Hamas has previously said it is not holding all the hostages who were brought to Gaza.

Once the truce ends, Netanyahu said at the weekend, ""we will return with full force to achieve our goals: the elimination of Hamas; ensuring that Gaza does not return to what it was; and of course the release of all our hostages.""

Palestinians in Gaza said on Monday they were praying for an extension of the truce. Some were visiting homes reduced to rubble by weeks of intensive Israeli bombardment, while others queued for flour and other essential aid being delivered by the United Nations' relief agency UNRWA.

The al-Sultan family, among hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes in the north of the Gaza Strip, snatched a few hours of sorely needed relaxation by the sea.

""We used these four days (of truce) and came to the beach in Deir Al-Balah to allow our children to have some fun,"" their mother, Hazem Al Sultan, said. ""We are anticipating the end of these four days, and we don’t know what will happen to us next.""

Palestinians gave the freed prisoners a jubilant reception in Ramallah, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA.

Omar Abdullah Al Hajj, 17, released on Sunday, told Reuters he'd been kept in the dark about what was happening in the outside world.

""We were 11 people crammed into a single room where usually there are six. There was never enough food and I was never told how long I was going to stay,"" he said.

""I can't believe I'm free now but my joy is incomplete because we still have our brothers who remain in prison,"" said Al Hajj, whom Israel's Justice Ministry accused of belonging to the Islamic Jihad militant group and posing a security threat which it did not specify.

The truce agreed last week is the first halt in fighting in the seven weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages back into Gaza.

In response to that attack, Israel has bombarded the enclave and mounted a ground offensive in the north. Some 14,800 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced.

Qatar, Egypt, the United States, the European Union and Spain were all working to extend the ceasefire, the Palestinian Authority's foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, said during a conference in Barcelona devoted to the crisis.

Al-Maliki, whose Authority runs the occupied West Bank, told the Forum for the Union of the Mediterranean that the international community must pressure Israel to extend the truce indefinitely. The death toll would double if war resumes on Tuesday, he added.

The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, told the same conference the current truce was an important first step but that far more would be needed to alleviate the situation.

Borrell also urged Israel not to ""recolonise Gaza"", saying that the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza was the best guarantee of Israel's peace and security.

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Hamas could no longer rule Gaza after hostilities end since it did not have ""an agenda for peace""."

1142776132,20231127,"Brazil's Foreign Minister, Mauro Vieira, described the meeting with Argentine Congresswoman-elect Diana Mondino, the foreign minister appointed by President-elect Javier Milei, as ""productive."" Vieira emphasized that, despite potential criticisms of Mercosur, the formal statements, and the shared desire of both countries to advance the bloc are what matter.

""We discussed, for example, the possibility of introducing bioceanic corridors, Mercosur's external negotiations, and the expansion and deepening of Mercosur's decisions. This is an area where we agree because we want a larger and more effective Mercosur to enhance regional integration,"" the minister stated at a press conference on Sunday (Nov. 26).

Brazil's presidency of Mercosur continues until December 7, just three days before Javier Milei assumes office. Although Milei initially advocated for Argentina's departure from the economic bloc during his campaign, he later shifted his stance to only proposing changes. Mercosur also includes Uruguay and Paraguay.

One of the agreements being negotiated during the Brazilian presidency is with the European Union. Approved in 2019 after 20 years of negotiations, the Mercosur-EU agreement requires ratification by the parliaments of all countries in the two blocs to take effect. The negotiation involves 31 countries.

""I indicated to her the areas in which we are negotiating during this Brazilian presidency of Mercosur, which is ending now, and the other countries and regions we are negotiating with. She expressed her satisfaction with that. That's what matters to me. We will continue working with this government until the end of its term and then with the new government, recognizing the shared desire to propel Mercosur forward,"" Vieira said.

During the meeting, Vieira received an invitation for President Lula to attend the Argentinian inauguration on December 10. ""There is no problem of any kind, no embarrassment whatsoever. The governments organize the guest lists, send them out, and those who want to accept do so; those who don't accept don't. However, there is also a different treatment for heads of state and direct guests,"" he said considering the closeness of Javier Milei and former president Jair Bolsonaro.

The minister also stated that he had not had the opportunity to pass on the invitation to President Lula, and his presence at the inauguration is being evaluated. ""What was said during the campaign is one thing; what happens during the government is another. I don't know, as I said, whether the president will be able to attend or not. He'll be returning from a long visit abroad and will have the Mercosur summit in Brazil,"" he explained.

Concerning Argentina's potential inclusion in BRICS, a coalition comprising developing nations such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, the minister emphasized Brazil's favorable stance. However, he pointed out that the decision rests with the new government. ""The Argentine government sought candidacy, and Brazil endorsed it as it aligns with Brazil's interests. It also aims to maintain a balanced geographical representation within BRICS, and naturally, Argentina holds significance as a key partner for Brazil."""

1142776137,20231127,"Europe banned most oil shipments from Russia almost a year ago, but it’s binging on diesel that may well have been made from Russian crude. The region’s imports of diesel from India, one of the biggest buyers of Russian crude, are on course to soar to 305,000 barrels a day, the most since at least January 2017, data from market-intelligence firm Kpler show.While it’s not possible to say with certainty that the molecules originated in Russia — India also processes oil from elsewhere — Moscow’s deliveries have given Indian refineries an ability to produce abundant diesel and boost exports.Arrivals into Europe in November include a rare shipment from Mumbai-based Nayara Energy Ltd., which imported almost 60% of its crude from Russia this year, according to Kpler. Reliance Industries Ltd., Europe’s top supplier of Indian diesel, draws more than third of its crude from Russia, the figures show.The surge in diesel imports from India also illustrates a fundamental shift in oil trading in the wake of the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. A year ago, Russia was Europe’s top supplier of diesel, a fuel vital to the industrial and transport sectors. The European Union banned most seaborne imports of Russian crude in December and oil products in February.In response, Europe and the UK have sought diesel supplies from other markets. India is helping to fill a supply gap as European imports from the US, Turkey and Saudi Arabia slip in November. Arrivals of Saudi diesel are set to drop to about 94,000 barrels a day, the lowest since February 2020.The “availability of Saudi barrels has fallen sharply in October and November due to planned local refinery maintenance, boosting interest for Indian diesel,” said Eugene Lindell, head of refined products at industry consultant Facts Global Energy.As the West shuns Russian oil, Moscow has found increased appetite for its crude in Asia. Indian refiners have been able to purchase Russian crude at a discount and sell the processed oil in markets, like Europe, where diesel is in high demand.“The 1.6-1.8 million barrels a day of Russian crude that Indian refiners buy creates a competitive edge that others do not have,” according to Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler.The share of Indian diesel flows to Asia now accounts for about 19% of the country’s total exports of the fuel, compared with 33% last year, he said. Much of that volume has been diverted to Europe. In total, Europe’s imports of diesel and gasoil this month are set to rise to 935,000 barrels a day, a 5% increase from October, Kpler data show."

The Council of the European Union on Monday decided to ratify the deal less than a week after the European Parliament gave its consent.

The deal is expected to cut some EUR140 million a year in duties for EU companies. As a result, bilateral trade is expected to grow by up to 30 percent within a decade, with EU exports growing by up to EUR4.5 billion annually. EU investment into New Zealand is expected to grow by up to 80 percent.

This landmark agreement also includes unprecedented sustainability commitments, including respect of the Paris Climate Agreement and core labour rights.

Trade agreements form part of the EU's open trade - or ""partnering"" - approach, which is one of the three goals of the European Economic Security Strategy presented in June. This agreement also strengthens the EU's engagement in the strategically and economically important Indo-Pacific region.

The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, ""New Zealand is a key partner for us in the Indo-Pacific region, and this ambitious free trade agreement will bring us even closer together.""

The EU-New Zealand FTA will provide new opportunities for businesses by eliminating all tariffs on EU exports to New Zealand; opening the New Zealand services market in key sectors such as financial services, telecommunications, maritime transport and delivery services; and ensuring non-discriminatory treatment to EU investors in New Zealand and vice versa.

The deal will improve access for EU companies to New Zealand government procurement contracts for goods, services, works and works concessions; and help small businesses export more through a dedicated chapter on small and medium enterprises;"

At the press conference after a meeting of the European Union Foreign Affairs Council, Szijjártó welcomed the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas which had afforded the release of hostages and saved lives.

Hamas has made it clear that only women and children would be released for now, and three of five abducted Hungarian citizens have been set free accordingly, he said.

Szijjártó noted the “multiple times” he had spoken with his Qatar counterpart, who had assured him of his assistance and had provided constant updates on the state of the negotiations. Hungary, he added, was grateful.

Though Budapest knew the names of the Hungarian hostages on the list, “we didn’t make this public as doing so would have jeopardised the success of the operation…” he said.

Information about the release of hostages were only made public when they were “already safe on Israeli soil,” he added.

While there were two men of Hungarian citizenship “definitely” still in the captivity of Hamas, “we don’t know about any of them in terms of their location…” he said.

“The longer the ceasefire, the better, given the higher chance that as many innocent people as possible may be freed from the captivity of Hamas,” Szijjártó said.

As we wrote yesterday, Hamas released another group of hostages on Sunday, two Hungarian children among them, details HERE.

Also we wrote about the latest poll, Hungarians worry about Islamist terrorism and sympathise with Israel, details HERE."
1142811355,20231127,"Israel and Hamas have reached a deal to extend a four-day truce by another two days.

Mediator Qatar announced the agreement, which will bring relief to hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

The White House later said it would see the release of an additional 20 hostages being held by Hamas.

The Israeli military said 11 hostages were handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza and had since arrived in Israel, marking the start of the fourth release under the original truce.

Meanwhile, Arab and European states have agreed on the need for a two-state solution at a meeting in Spain.
• Deal reached to extend Gaza truce by two days
• None List of hostages to be released Tuesday received
• More aid cleared for Gaza as truce holds

Mediator Qatar said a deal had been reached to extend a truce between Israeli and Hamas forces in Gaza by two days, continuing a pause in seven weeks of warfare that has killed thousands and laid waste to the Palestinian enclave.

""An agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip,"" a Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson said in a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

The agreement was confirmed by the White House, which said another 20 women and children would be released by Hamas. National security spokesman John Kirby said the administration hoped the pause would be extended further.

Hamas also said it had agreed to a two-day extension to the truce with Qatar and Egypt, which have been facilitating indirect negotiations between the two sides.

There was no immediate comment from Israel. However, in what might have been an implicit confirmation, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said on Tuesday that Israel's government had approved the addition of 50 female prisoners to its list of Palestinians for potential release if extra Israeli hostages were freed.

Israel previously said it would extend the truce by one day for every 10 more hostages released.

""An agreement has been reached with the brothers in Qatar and Egypt to extend the temporary humanitarian truce by two more days, with the same conditions as in the previous truce,"" a Hamas official said in a phone call with Reuters.

It was not clear how many hostages would be released under the extended truce agreement, but earlier the head of Egypt's State Information Service, Diaa Rashwan, said the deal being negotiated would include the release of 20 Israeli hostages and 60 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

The initial truce was due to end on Monday night (local time).

The truce agreed last week was the first halt in fighting in the seven weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli estimates.

In response to that attack, Israel has bombarded the enclave and mounted a ground offensive in the north. Some 14,800 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced.

Wide areas of the Hamas-ruled enclave have been flattened by Israeli air strikes and artillery bombardments, and a humanitarian crisis has unfolded as supplies of food, fuel, drinking water and medicine run out.

On Sunday, Hamas freed 17 people, including a 4-year-old Israeli-American girl, bringing the total number the militant group has released since Friday to 58, including foreigners. Israel freed 39 teenage Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, taking the total number of Palestinians freed under the truce to 117.

The Israeli military said on Monday evening that 11 hostages were now back in Israel — the start of the fourth hostage release under the original truce.

The released hostages would undergo an initial medical assessments before being reunited with their families, the Israeli military said.

Shortly after the arrival of the hostages was confirmed, Israel's prison authority said 33 Palestinian inmates had been released.

The hostages released from Gaza on Monday included three French citizens, two Germans and six Argentinians, a Qatari foreign ministry spokesman said on social media platform X.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock welcomed the release of the hostages, including ""two German teenagers"".

""After 52 days of suffering and despair, their mother can hold them in her arms again,"" Ms Baerbock posted on X, formerly Twitter.

""My thoughts are with the families who are still waiting in fear.

""We are doing everything we can so that they too can hold them in their arms.""

French President Emmanuel Macron said he was ""extremely happy"" about the release of three French children who were held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.

Mr Macron said the children were two 12-year-olds named Eitan and Erez and a 16-year-old called Sahar.

List of hostages to be released Tuesday received

Israel's government has received a list of hostages who are expected to be released on Tuesday, Israel's Army Radio reported, citing the Israeli prime minister's office.

The Axios news website reported the list contained 10 hostages. There was no immediate comment from the prime minister's office.

The US State Department said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit Israel, the West Bank and the United Arab Emirates this week to discuss sustaining aid flows to Gaza, and freeing all hostages as well as US principles for the future of Gaza and the need for an independent Palestinian state.

The original truce agreement allowed more aid trucks into Gaza, where the civilian population faces shortages of food, fuel, drinking water and medicine. An estimated 1.8 million of the territory's 2.3 million population are internally displaced, according to the United Nations.

While describing the extension as ""a glimpse of hope and humanity,"" UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said two more days was not enough time to meet Gaza's aid needs.

Arab states and the European Union agreed at a meeting in Spain that a two-state solution was the answer to the conflict, with EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell saying the Palestinian Authority should rule Gaza.

Mr Borrell said all EU members attending the meeting of Mediterranean nations in Barcelona, and almost all attendees overall, had agreed on the need for a two-state solution.

The Palestinian Authority must hold elections and improve its functioning but is the only ""viable solution"" to the future leadership of Gaza, currently run by Hamas Islamists, to avoid a ""power vacuum"", he said.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the Palestinian people should decide who rules them, and that any talk of administration of Gaza after the conflict should focus on the West Bank and Gaza as one entity.

A two-state solution envisages a state for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said the Palestinian Authority, which lost control of the Gaza Strip in a 2007 power struggle with Hamas, had no need to return to Gaza, adding: ""We have been there all the time, we have 60,000 public workers there.""

The three were speaking at the conclusion of a short meeting of the Forum for the Union of the Mediterranean in Barcelona, a 43-member grouping of European, North African and Middle Eastern countries.

Israel did not attend the summit. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan spoke as a representative of a group of ministers from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

Mr Borrell said he hoped the truce that began on Friday would last ""a few more days"".

The Palestinian Foreign Minister said Qatar, Egypt, the United States and the European Union were working to extend the truce, warning if it was not extended, the death toll would double because Gaza's population was now concentrated in the south of the strip.

But the Jordanian minister added, however: ""Some among us are still refusing to call for a ceasefire … We demand it be implemented immediately.""

More aid cleared for Gaza as truce holds

Palestinians in Gaza said they were praying for an extension of the truce. Some were visiting homes reduced to rubble by weeks of intensive Israeli bombardment, while others queued for flour and other essential aid being delivered by the United Nations' relief agency UNRWA.

UNRWA was awaiting Israeli clearance to send aid trucks and ambulances into northern Gaza.

""Too many people have lost their lives, too many people have lost their houses, so we welcome this ceasefire. We hope that this ceasefire is extended,"" Thomas White, the director of UNRWA affairs, told Reuters.

Palestinians gave the freed prisoners a jubilant reception in Ramallah, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA.

1142817623,20231127,"WASHINGTON — After seven weeks of struggling with a crisis that defies easy solutions, President Joe Biden could take solace in saving a single 4-year-old girl whose parents were killed in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

But gratifying as it was to secure the release of Avigail Idan from her Hamas captors over the weekend, the challenge for Biden going forward is not only to free the rest of the Americans being held hostage but to use the success of recent days to alter the trajectory of the war consuming the Gaza Strip.

At the president’s urging, the two sides agreed Monday to extend the temporary pause in the war between Israel and Hamas two more days to allow the release of an additional 20 hostages, according to Qatar, the Persian Gulf emirate that has been serving as intermediary. That gives all sides more breathing space but only postpones the most critical question by another 48 hours — namely what happens whenever the negotiated pause eventually expires.

Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times

Israel has vowed to resume its withering assault on Hamas once the hostage releases end, and Biden has said repeatedly that the country has a right to defend itself after a terrorist attack that killed an estimated 1,200 people. At the same time, the president hopes to influence any fresh military action, ensuring that it is more targeted and does more to avoid civilian casualties. The White House has already warned Israel against moving into southern Gaza, where many Palestinians living in the coastal enclave have fled, without a concrete plan to protect civilians.

“Biden’s in a bind,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East negotiator now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “He’s tethered himself to Israel’s war aims — eradicating Hamas. But in view of the rising humanitarian catastrophe and the exponential rise in Palestinian deaths, he’s looking for ways to de-escalate and eventually for an exit ramp.”

“Freeing hostages is one way to try and extend the truce, get aid into Gaza and hostages out,” Miller added. “But there’s a moment of decision coming when Israel seeks to resume its ground campaign. Will he press Israel to stop or at least try to shape its operations in the south?”

The announcement Monday of a two-day extension in the truce came after a weekend of telephone diplomacy by Biden. He consulted with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, on Saturday, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Sunday.

In working to extend the pause and hostage releases, Biden has American interests to consider as well as those of Israel. Among the 240 hostages taken by Hamas, 10 were believed to be American. Among those released under the original deal brokered last week by Biden to free 50 hostages, the only American to be handed over so far has been Avigail, who has dual citizenship in the United States and Israel and whose name is often spelled Abigail in U.S. media.

Two American women from that group had been expected to be among the hostages released Monday in the final stage of the initial deal between Israel and Hamas, but were not freed. That was a significant setback for Biden, who was already under criticism for failing to win the release of the vast majority of the American hostages.

Now the question will be whether any or all of the Americans will be among the hostages turned over during the two-day extension agreed to Monday. Israel has said it would extend the pause by a day for each 10 additional hostages released.

“We’re grateful that we’ve got an extra two days to work with here,” John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, said before it became known that no Americans would be released Monday. “That will result in the release of 20 more individuals, women and children.”

He added: “We’d certainly like to see even that extension extended further until all the hostages are released. That’s really the goal here. Get all the hostages home with their families where they belong however long that could take.”

Biden and his team, though, have been vague about what happens after that. “We’re going to continue to urge our Israeli counterparts as they plan to go back to military operations that they do it in the most discreet, deliberate, careful, cautious way possible,” Kirby said.

The longer the pause, the more time Hamas has to regroup in preparation for further Israeli assault, according to military experts. Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, acknowledged over the weekend that Hamas had exploited the hostage agreement to build itself back up after weeks of airstrikes and ground attacks by Israeli military forces.

“I can’t deny that Hamas gained some benefits from this deal,” Sullivan said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “One of them is the ability to refit and retool inside Gaza. Another is to try to use social media and other formats to generate some propaganda out of it.” But he added that the trade-off had been dozens of “innocent people coming out of Gaza to be reunited with their families.”

Republicans have offered mixed responses to the hostage deal-making, leery of challenging Netanyahu, the leader of Israel’s right-wing governing coalition, even as they castigate Biden for supposed weakness. Netanyahu agreed not only to enter a temporary truce to facilitate the release of hostages but also to release three Palestinians held in Israeli prisons for various crimes for every one hostage freed under the deal brokered by Biden.

“What I’m grateful for is that these hostages have been returned to their families,” former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican presidential candidate, said on “State of the Union” on CNN over the weekend. “That’s extraordinarily important and humane to have that done. So I think President Biden deserves credit for that.”

“Where I think he’s starting to err,” Christie added, is “to say he hopes that this continues, that the truce continues. He can’t be doing that kind of stuff, in my view, publicly.”

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., took a harsher position on “Fox News Sunday.” While he said he did not “want to second-guess the Israeli government,” he was happy to second-guess Biden, accusing him of not supporting Israel enough.

“I have to say it seems like President Biden puts more pressure on Israel than he does on Hamas and its hosts in Qatar,” Cotton said. “The Biden administration has consistently behind the scenes insisted that Israel’s government take steps that are clearly not in Israel’s interest,” he added, citing the delivery of fuel to Gaza, which he said would aid Hamas, not just civilians.

Still, the pause in fighting has eased some of the criticism Biden has taken from the left wing of his party, which has assailed him for, in its view, supporting Israel too much. Israel’s military campaign has killed thousands of civilians in Gaza even as it has focused on destroying Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union.

The release of Avigail gave Biden a small but emotionally powerful victory amid all the tumult in the region. Taken hostage after her parents were gunned down in front of her, Avigail spent seven weeks in captivity and turned 4 on Friday in the hands of Hamas. Her case generated waves of international concern and condemnation.

“She’s been through a terrible trauma,” Biden said. “What she endured is unthinkable.”

But he reveled in her release. “Thank God she’s home,” he said. “I wish I was there to hold her.”"
1142815118,20231127,"The Chief of Niger's military regime, General Abdourahamane Tchiani, abolished a law issued in 2015 that criminalized the smuggling of illegal immigrants seeking to reach Europe via Libya.

Under this law, Nigeriens who, in one way or another, facilitated the transfer of foreign immigrants to the north, Libya and Algeria, were subject to criminal prosecution.

An informed source revealed the news the French website Mondafrique Sunday and it would probably cause a shock in Brussels, where support for the Nigerien regime that was overthrown on July 26 was based above all on the desire expressed by the authorities to combat the influx of immigrants seeking to arrive in Europe, while it could open doors for immigrants to cross into neighboring Libya and Algeria.

The French website said that since the adoption of the law inspired by the European Union and formulated with the support of the United Nations, the smuggling networks based in northern Niger have been dismantled, and a large part of their equipment has been seized.

The law transformed Niger into a center for containing immigrants from West and Central Africa heading north, as the capital, Niamey, hosts a large reception center through which immigrants are returned to their countries of origin. The European Union, the International Organization for Migration, and the United States also funded the process of strengthening border control services in Niger.

Niger decided to repeal the law in response to the positions taken by the European Union against the July 26 coup, its support for the extremely harsh sanctions announced by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and its calls for the return of ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, according to Mondafrique."

1142824707,20231127,"As of September 2023, there are 95,000 foreign citizens who are employed in Hungary. Experts expect this number to continue to grow. A regular growth can be noted in the numbers, according to the report made by Hungary’s Central Statistical Office (KSH). This means the number of foreign workers can soon reach 100,000.

Seeing the latest data in this report, the growth is notable in the number of employed foreigners. In 2020, the number was around 60-70,000, last year, it moved to around 80,000. In the September of this year, it was 95,500. This means that in the last year, the country experienced an influx of roughly 13,000 foreign workers.

Where are they coming from?

In the last three years, the number of expats arriving from outside the European Union has doubled from 35,000 to 73,000. This is most likely helped by the simplified process of welcoming workers from more than a dozen countries along with Serbia and Ukraine, writes Portfolio. Companies can ‘borrow’ workers with expedited administration from these countries, but the influx of expats is not limited to these countries. Although, it’s mostly the bigger companies that can afford to borrow workers, in contrast to the smaller companies where there are not enough resources for the labor import.

However, things are bound to change with the new immigration regulation that will take effect in a year. The new regulation also introduced a new type of categorisation for expats. These new categories limit the length of the stay at a maximum of 3 years, the shortest being the six months allowed for seasonal guest workers. The regulation states that there’s no crossing allowed between the categories. This new regulation will also specify the jobs that can’t employ foreign workers, thus ensuring that the domestic vacancies are filled by Hungarians.

The Central Statistical Office’s report every three months provides insight into the unoccupied jobs, pointing towards the labor shortages in these areas. The most recent data reported 80,000 unfilled jobs. This means Hungary definitely needs the foreign workers who seem to be flooding into the country.

Surprisingly, against prejudices, the guest workers who come to Hungary contribute to the economy and are well worth employing for the companies. Calculations indicate that every worker who arrives to Hungary saves three Hungarian jobs, because the company continues to operate and expand in Hungary. Especially in the case of Asian expats who are exceedingly more productive in their jobs than those previously employed. This way giving incentive to these previously employed colleagues to work harder in order to keep their job. In some sectors, productivity grew by 30%. It’s easy to see why companies are prone to employ foreign workers and why the Hungarian economy is in dire need of them.

1142830627,20231127,"Arab states and the European Union agreed at a meeting in Spain on Monday that a two-state solution was the answer to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, with EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell saying the Palestinian Authority should rule Gaza.

Borrell said all EU members attending the meeting of Mediterranean nations in Barcelona and almost all attendees overall had agreed on the need for a two-state solution.

The Palestinian Authority must hold elections and improve its functioning but is the only ""viable solution"" to the future leadership of Gaza, currently run by Hamas Islamists, to avoid a ""power vacuum"", he said.

A current four-day truce is the first halt in fighting in the seven weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

In response to that attack, Israel bombarded the enclave and mounted a ground offensive in the north. Some 14,800 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced.

Hamas said it wanted to extend the truce. An Israeli official told Reuters the onus was on Hamas to produce a new list of 10 hostages it could free on Tuesday in exchange for that becoming an additional truce day.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the Palestinian people should decide who rules them, and that any talk of administration of Gaza after the conflict should focus on the West Bank and Gaza as one entity.

A two-state solution envisages a state for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said the Palestinian Authority, which lost control of the Gaza Strip in a 2007 power struggle with Hamas, had no need to return to Gaza, adding: ""We have been there all the time, we have 60,000 public workers there.""

The three were speaking at the conclusion of a short meeting of the Forum for the Union of the Mediterranean in Barcelona, a 43-member grouping of European, North African and Middle Eastern countries.

Israel did not attend the summit. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan spoke as a representative of a group of ministers from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

Borrell said he hoped the truce that began on Friday would last ""a few more days"".

Palestinian Foreign Minister al-Maliki said Qatar, Egypt, the United States, and the European Union were working to extend the truce, warning if it was not extended, the death count would double because Gaza's population was now concentrated in the south of the strip.

""We have an opportunity today that will end tonight, to extend the ceasefire... I count on the support of my colleagues... for us to all leave here with a loud and strong voice that can be heard in all parts of the world: no to the war, yes to the ceasefire,"" he said.

Jordan's Safadi added, however: ""Some among us are still refusing to call for a ceasefire... We demand it be implemented immediately."""
1142836006,20231127,"Earlier this month, EU lawmakers met for the second trilogue meeting in the negotiations on the upcoming Cyber Resilience Act (“CRA”). The CRA aims to strengthen cybersecurity in Europe on an unprecedent scale – the European Commission refers to it as the “first ever EU-wide legislation of its kind”. With a political agreement expected soon, this article outlines the key points of the proposed regulation and the current status of the legislative discussion and provides an outlook on the final stages of the legislative process.

The CRA is the centerpiece of the latest European cybersecurity legislative package. It complements existing, predominately sector-specific legislations, such as the Second Network and Information Security Directive (“NIS2”), the Critical Entities Resilience Directive (“CER”), the Cyber Security Act (“CSA”) or the Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”). Its scope also partly overlaps with the Radio Equipment Directive Delegated Act (“RED Delegated Act”) relating to internet-connected radio equipment.

The CRA marks a turning point for the cybersecurity of both consumer and industrial products in Europe. Compared to existing frameworks, it aims to regulate product security at the supplier level, imposing obligations on manufacturers, importers and distributors.

Following the Commission’s proposal in September 2022 (see our previous articles of 25 April 2022 and 4 October 2022; for a UK perspective, please see our article of 28 March 2023) and Council and Parliament’s position in July earlier this year, trilogue negotiations have been ongoing since September. A political agreement now appears to be within reach, with the trilogue expected to conclude at the end of this month.

The CRA introduces a comprehensive set of obligations for manufacturers, importers and distributors of “products with digital elements”. The notion of “products with digital elements” covers most software and hardware products and their remote data processing solutions, ranging from standard software solutions (e.g. text and photo editing software, games, operating systems) to IoT products (e.g. home automation devices, smart toys, routers). The decisive factor is that the foreseeable use of the product with digital elements is its connection to other devices or a network. While complex in nature, the regulation can be broken down into three key pillars:
• The CRA places products with digital elements under the existing CE (Conformité Européenne) mark framework. This triggers a number of market release obligations defined by the criticality category of a product (Non-Critical, Critical Class I and Critical Class II), which must be determined during the development phase.
• To obtain a CE mark, the product must pass a mandatory conformity assessment against the requirements of the CRA. This assessment can be carried out internally for “Non-Critical” products or, in the case of a ""Critical Class II"" or “Highly Critical” products, externally by an independent ""Notified Body"". Where “Critical Class I” products are concerned it depends on the use of “Harmonised Standards” whether the internal assessment procedure is available or whether the assessment must go through a “Notified Body"". There is also the possibility for products of all categories to be assessed based on a (yet to be adopted) European cybersecurity certification scheme under the CSA. The use of Harmonised Standards or a European cybersecurity certification scheme will come with the benefit of a presumption of compliance with the requirements of the CRA. It is currently expected that most products (~90%) will fall into the ""Non-Critical"" category where an internal assessment will suffice. The CE marking process is completed by issuing an EU Declaration of Conformity for the product and affixing the CE mark.
• The CRA coordinates the conformity assessment procedures in case a product with digital elements is also classified as a high-risk AI system under the AI Act.

Compliance obligations during product development and after product release
• The CRA’s security requirements must be considered at all stages of product development (“security by default”). This includes ongoing risk assessments and management of product vulnerabilities. The compliance measures taken must be thoroughly documented.
• The CRA introduces a “cybersecurity support period” during which the manufacturer has to handle vulnerabilities of the product effectively. This includes, for example, security updates, ongoing monitoring of the product's compliance with the CRA, and maintaining a single point of contact for customers for the reporting of vulnerabilities.
• The CRA sets out mandatory information as well as instructions that must be provided to the customer, either physically or digitally.
• During the cybersecurity support period, both a vulnerability management system and a cyber incident response system must be maintained. The CRA provides for strict reporting obligations to either the European Union Agency for Cyber Security (""ENISA""), the National Computer Security Incident Response Teams (""CRITs""), or both (see below for details).
• The existing CRA drafts provide for a very short initial notification period of 24 hours after becoming aware of the incident. This deadline would even fall significantly short of the challenging deadline of 72 hours for reporting personal data breaches under the GDPR. Depending on the incident, public notification of customers may also be required.

The CRA will be enforced by “market surveillance authorities” (to be established by EU Member States), with fines ranging from 1% to 2,5% of the company's global annual turnover. This range of fines follows the European trend of enforcement through severe sanctions, such as those introduced in the GDPR and DSA.

EU lawmakers are currently negotiating a final political agreement on the CRA. The trilogue began on 27 September 2023, and the last meeting was held earlier this month on the 8 November 2023. While a lot of common ground seems to have been found, some key aspects of the regulation remain controversial. The following three aspects were at the centre of the discussion at the last trilogue meeting.

A common position on CRA reporting requirements has not yet been found. Legislators have been unable to reach a consensus on which body should be notified in case of an actively exploited vulnerability or a cybersecurity incident: The ENISA, the CRITs, or both? This question is of particular importance, given the sensitive nature of the information included in the notification.

There is also a lack of clarity about the scope of the reporting obligations. Prior to the start of the trilogue, it was rumoured that these obligations might be limited to serious cases, i.e. actively exploited product vulnerabilities, excluding failed attempts and security incidents with severe impact. Such a limitation would provide significant relief to companies during the cybersecurity support period.

Apart from the ongoing debate on the naming of the product categories (""critical"" or ""impactful""), the discussion focused on the method for determining the criticality of a product and the list of critical products in Annex II. This list may be updated in the future by delegated or implementing acts (to be determined) of the Commission. Part of the proposed actions to regulate highly critical products was to require mandatory safety certification under an existing or yet to be defined framework.

Finally, no agreement has yet been reached on the cybersecurity support period after a product has been placed on the market. The Council stipulated the expected lifetime as relevant period. Parliament argued for a minimum period of 5 years, unless the lifetime of a product is shorter. Notably, a proportionality approach now seems to have found its way into the determination of the support period, which could prevent extensive support obligations after the release of a product.

A final agreement on the CRA between EU lawmakers is expected at the next trilogue meeting on 30 November. This finalisation would fit neatly into the original timetable, with a planned vote on the CRA in March 2024 and ratification before the Parliament elections in June 2024.

The application period of the CRA is still to be determined. While the Commission’s proposal suggested an application period of 24 months, the positions of Parliament and Council envisaged a longer period of 36 months. The legislators' stance on the application of the notification obligations are even further apart, ranging from 12 months (Commission) and 18 months (Council) to 24 months (Parliament).

In any event, it is required to monitor the development on the legislative progress on the CRA framework. We will continue reporting on the development of the CRA to support our clients in organising their development and market release practices accordingly.

1142836007,20231127,"BAGHDAD: Iraq sees a risk of regional conflict if the current truce in Gaza is not turned into a permanent cease-fire, the Iraqi prime minister’s foreign affairs adviser said, as mediators sought an extension of the temporary four-day Israel-Hamas truce.

 Israel’s devastating bombardment of Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel has drawn in Iran-aligned armed groups in the region including Lebanese Hezbollah and several Iraqi factions, who have mounted near-daily attacks on Israeli and US forces.

 But there have been no reports of attacks on US forces in Iraq or Syria since Israel and Hamas began a four-day truce last week that was set to expire on Monday, compared to over 70 in the weeks prior.

 Some of the main Iraqi armed factions behind the recent attacks, including Kataib Sayyid Al-Shuhada and Kataeb Hezbollah, have announced they will abide by the Gaza cease-fire but indicated they would resume attacks if it ends.

 They have also said in statements that they still seek the eventual ouster of US forces in Iraq. There are around 2,500 US troops on a mission the US says is to advise and assist Iraqi forces battling remnants of Islamic State.

 “The entire region is on the verge of a devastating conflict that may include everyone, and the extent of its expansion or how to control and stop it is not known,” said Farhad Alaadin, foreign affairs adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani.

 “For this reason, we see any cease-fire in the conflict as beneficial and important at this stage for the people of Palestine and Gaza first and for all countries in the region, including Iraq,” he told Reuters.

 European Union Ambassador to Iraq Thomas Seiler said in a social media post that he hopes Iraqi factions “continue with their cessation of attacks.”

 Two sets of US strikes in Iraq last week killed 10 members of Kataeb Hezbollah, according to posts by the group on social media, a move condemned by the Iraqi government as escalatory and a violation of sovereignty.

 Kataeb Hezbollah is part of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a group of mostly Shiite Muslim armed groups formed to fight Islamic State in 2014 that became an official security agency under the command of the prime minister.

 While technically part of the state, some of the PMF’s most powerful Iran-backed factions often act outside the chain of command. Sudani has said attacks by armed groups on foreign forces in Iraq were unlawful and went against the country’s national interest."

In fact, the PVV had been subject to a cordon sanitaire ever since the fall of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s first government in 2012, which it had supported (and which for that reason was colloquially referred to as Brown I, after the fascist brownshirts, instead of Rutte I). The PVV’s platform calls for bans on the Quran, on mosques, and on Islamic schools; a retraction of the Dutch king’s apology for slavery and the restoration of blackface at St. Nicholas celebrations; as well as an abolition of asylum and of free movement of workers within the European Union. Even by the standards of contemporary national conservatives, the platform is made up of a poisonous mix of heinous impulses.

Wilders maintained his presence in parliament, but his appeal and influence were limited while his caucus calcified, as it has now: Eight of the 10 longest-serving members in the new Dutch House are PVV members. But Wilders is the only member of the party as a legal entity, and its absolute ruler as a result, unbound by leadership elections or other concerns. The party does not organize conferences and such, and many of its incoming representatives do not know each other or their new colleagues. Combine that with the lack of outside options, thanks to the party’s reputation, for Wilders’s elected officials, and you end up with a predictable caucus of goons and misfits.

The explicit agreement among mainstream parties to exclude Wilders from governing coalitions came to an end this summer. Rutte brought down his own government over a minor disagreement with one of his coalition partners, the Christian Union, over family reunification rules for asylum recipients. Rutte’s successor as VVD party leader, Justice Minister Dilan Yesilgoz, then opened the door to cooperation with the PVV to rally voters who favor a right-wing government around her.

Wilders jumped at the opportunity and claimed that his priorities had shifted toward health care and economic anxiety. The Dutch media ecosystem complied and started referring to him as “Geert Milders.” As he started rising in the polls, especially after the conflict in Gaza broke out, Yesilgoz tried to walk back her earlier words.

Too little, too late: Voters preferred the original over the copy. In that sense, Wilders’s rise fits American political scientist Larry Bartels’s thesis—that democracy erodes from the top—almost perfectly.

While that is the immediate explanation for Wilders’s success, alarm bells about discontent among a large group of voters—and an openness to wild options—had been ringing for some time. Earlier this year, the agrarian-populist Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB) became the largest party in the Dutch Senate after winning the provincial elections on its first try. In 2019, the radical-right conspiracy theorists of Forum for Democracy had similarly made their Senate debut as the largest party.

This impulse predates Wilders’s founding of the PVV in 2006: The right-populist Pim Fortuyn List broke through with 26 seats in 2002 after its eponymous founder was murdered by an animal rights activist. It also extends beyond voters open to Wilders’s message. On Wednesday, in addition to Wilders’s large gains, a new party (the New Social Contract) led by former Christian-Democrat Pieter Omtzigt, the second-most veteran member of the Dutch House, secured 20 seats mere months after its founding.

It is not obvious what the Dutch political class can or will plausibly do to address this discontent. It is not merely a thermostatic response to left-wing policy: Eternal prime minister Mark Rutte has mostly led fairly bland center-right governments since he entered office in 2010, while his predecessor was a Christian-Democrat.

In fact, there is a bloc of voters whose expressed wishes are so far out of line with majority opinion and with the domestic and international legal frameworks that the Netherlands has spent decades developing and promoting that they will not be satisfied by any realistic policy changes. These voters include the 50 percent of Wilders’s supporters who have been loyal to him for the past decade, and those who have stuck with the Forum for Democracy as even its own elected officials fled the party’s mix of antisemitism, anti-vaccine lunacy, racism, and love of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Like comparable voters in other countries, they are heavily male, lower-income, less likely to hold a college degree, and detached from social networks.

Disaffected voters outside of Wilders’ core supporters harbor a mix of concerns that include some where policy and governance could and should be improved—though that’s easier said than done. The nitrogen emission crisis that catapulted the BBB to its Senate victory requires difficult choices over land use—between agricultural activity, housing, infrastructure, and nature preservation—that simply need to be made instead of paralyzing the country for years.

Relatedly, housing policy in the Netherlands, as in the United States and elsewhere in the West, has been a disaster for decades. Limited construction in the face of ongoing urbanization, population growth, and ever decreasing household size has placed home ownership and even the ability to rent out of reach for far too many. Too many Dutch politicians, including mainstream ones, try to place the blame for these problems, which are of their own making, on migrants.

The Dutch system of capital income taxation is in flux after elements of it were struck down by the courts. Natural gas extraction in the northeast, suspended last month, caused earthquakes and significant damage: Many affected homeowners still await compensation. The child care benefit scandal that ended Rutte’s third government and made Omtzigt’s career ruined the lives of thousands of families, many of whom still await compensation as well.

But are these areas where a Wilders government would dramatically improve matters? Take the child care benefit scandal, the biggest political scandal in the Netherlands in recent years. The Dutch tax agency concluded it had targeted victimized families on the basis of national origin, donations to mosques, and “not looking Dutch.” It’s like putting U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez in charge of monitoring the Egyptian government’s human rights record.

On the international front, there are ways to reduce immigration at the margin: by forcing Dutch universities to offer more instruction in Dutch or by raising taxes on high-skilled immigrants. Such changes would be costly to institutions of higher learning, the Dutch knowledge economy, and industrial champions such as ASML, and I’m sure some of these same voters would complain about that in turn. The Netherlands could scale down its climate agenda somewhat, though significant aspects of it are managed at the EU level. And the country could return to its traditional position of budgetary hawkishness within the European Union after a brief excursion to Club Med—though Wilders’s platform, which calls for a lower pension age, reduced VAT, and more public health care spending, goes in the opposite direction.

But whether it’s immigration, EU membership, religious freedom, or Dutch support for Ukraine, there simply is no path forward for the dramatic policy shifts envisioned by Wilders and his ilk. There is no pro-Putin majority among Dutch MPs (or voters). The Netherlands is not going to leave the EU and reintroduce the guilder or convince NATO to expel Turkey. It is not going to abolish its representation in Ramallah because “it already has an embassy in Amman,” as the PVV stated in its election manifesto.

In fact, let’s not get ahead of ourselves: It is not at all obvious that there is a majority in the Dutch House that supports a government led by Wilders or one that his party participates in. The two indispensable parties for any majority are Omtzigt’s New Social Contract and, as has been the case for years now, the VVD.

During the campaign, Omtzigt suggested that he would not govern with Wilders; he predictably changed his tune this week. It would be somewhat ironic if partnerships with Wilders became the unifying thread of the political career of Omtzigt, a man who has long claimed to care deeply about religious freedom. Those who recall how American warriors for religious freedom responded to former U.S. President Donald Trump’s Muslim ban will not be shocked.

The VVD has adopted a trickier position. Despite triggering the election and opening the door to Wilders, it has now announced that it’s tuning out. It is unwilling to join any coalition—though it would be willing to support a minority right-wing government, presumably formed by PVV, the New Social Contract, and BBB. Such a government would effectively be Rutte I in reverse, with the VVD and the PVV swapping places and the New Social Contract and BBB taking the place of the Christian-Democratic party that Omtzigt was then a part of.

Variations will surely be considered, and I imagine that Yesilgoz would happily join a coalition if she gets to be prime minister. Wilders is responsible for selecting a so-called “scout” to explore the possibilities. His first choice was forced to resign when news broke that Utrecht University, the scout’s former employer, had filed charges of fraud and bribery against him. The new beacon of hope for concerned citizens is Ronald Plasterk, a former education and home affairs minister for the Labor Party who has drifted to the right in recent years.

The alternative to a right-wing coalition—off the table while Wilders has the initiative—would be a broad centrist coalition in which the VVD and New Social Contract are joined by the GL-PvdA and either the liberal Democrats 66 party or the BBB. But even consideration of that option is unlikely to happen before 2024.

This route would not be a very satisfying outcome to many New Social Contract and VVD voters. At the same time, it would avoid not just Wilders, but also a coalition featuring two entirely new parties, including many inexperienced and unvetted PVV MPs. For the outgoing prime minister, who has set his sights on a leadership role at NATO or the European Commission, it would surely constitute a more attractive legacy. And at a time of geopolitical upheaval, it might be the responsible choice.

Though the size of Wilders’ win came as a major surprise, these two coalition options were basically already on the table based on preelection polling. Ironically, a shift to the right may well be less likely now than if Wilders had won fewer seats. As the leader of the largest party, he would traditionally become prime minister. To his potential coalition partners, that may be a bridge too far in a way that a less dominant role might not have been.

But regardless of the eventual outcome and whatever else may motivate his voters, Wilders’s victory is first and foremost a message of intense hatred toward the Netherlands’ ethnic and religious minorities as well as its immigrant population. The legitimation of Wilders’s open bigotry and the willingness of millions of Dutch voters to tell their neighbors and co-workers that they find their mere existence odious are, well, not great."
1142833506,20231127,"Baroness Helena Kennedy of the Shaws, KC, is one of the UK’s most established lawyers, a bencher at Gray’s Inn and a member of the House of Lords. Kennedy is also a broadcaster, journalist and lecturer. She has not only acted in many of the most prominent cases of the last decade but has promoted civil liberties and human rights far and wide as Director of the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute.

Baroness Kennedy has also worked to uphold the independence of the legal profession and respond to some of the most abhorrent acts committed by mankind. She recently spoke with JURIST UK Senior Editor James Joseph to discuss her work.

A recording of the interview can be found on the JURIST News YouTube Channel.

JURIST: So you’ve recently raised the authoritarian attacks by the UK Government on lawyers and the importance of a free, and independent legal profession, which needs to be upheld. You compared such attacks to tactics used by authoritarian regimes, something which I know you spent many years working on. I recently interviewed a former Lord Chancellor on this. How important is the independence of the legal profession, both here and around the world?

Baroness Kennedy: Well, it’s one of those things I feel that sometimes gets lost when we talk about the rule of law. We always link it to the idea that, first of all, “we’re all equal before the courts,” and that “justice shouldn’t just be justice for the powerful,” and it should be justice for everyone. That’s one of the fundamentals of the rule of law. But one of the other fundamentals is that there should be an independent judiciary, and people tend to know that one. But what they don’t tend to ever refer to is that there also has to be an independent legal profession—that lawyers have to be recognised as being fundamental to the good workings of the courts. People need to be represented because they often don’t know, for example, what constitutes good evidence and what burdens of proof there might be. So as lawyers, we bring a special set of skills and expertise to the proceedings, but we also bring a high standard of ethics. That has been our belief.

For example, we really have to emphasise to the public that lawyers act on behalf of their clients, not just to make sure that their clients get a fair hearing, but also to protect the system. Over the years, there have been ways in which the media, but also politicians, and also the general public, seem to think that the lawyer who’s acting, for example, for someone charged with terrorism must sympathise with the cause, that a lawyer acting on immigration cases is somehow trying to open the doors to everybody to enter a country and is politically driven. And the reality is that lawyers should not be associated with the belief systems of their clients.

What we want is for people to be well represented because that makes the system good and true for all of us. I’ve done many cases, acting for people who have been strongly connected with views that I don’t share. For example, I’ve acted for fundamentalist Islamists who are absolutely against equality for women. They don’t believe that women should be judges or should be taking part in public life, and they feel women should remain at home. It’s never stopped me acting for them. Although, I have a very strong set of very egalitarian principles when it comes to feminism. So, people shouldn’t be associated with the views of their clients. However, the press do it all the time. We’ve recently had the business, which really was quite outrageous, of politicians talking about ‘lefty lawyers‘ representing people who are asylum seekers, as though somehow your politics come into it. People represent people who have proper cases, and their role is to ensure that there is due process according to law, so this is infuriating when people should know better, sometimes lawyers themselves. Our home secretary is a lawyer and yet she finds herself saying things about lawyers that I think are deeply inappropriate and improper for someone who believes in the rule of law. And so it’s very easy when governments are being populist and seeking popular support on issues, it’s very easy for them to fall into that trap of undermining some of the things that are fundamental to the good workings of democracy.

What you and I know and all good lawyers know, is that the law is a fabric that holds society together and it doesn’t matter whether you’re a commercial lawyer or an immigration lawyer or a criminal lawyer, whatever kind of lawyer you are, we know or we should know that that it’s all of a piece. Once you start destroying parts of the legal system and thinking that some people don’t deserve representation or due process, then you’re really undermining the whole fabric. We should be proud in the United Kingdom, that we have the respect of the world when it comes to the law, and that’s partly because we have great judges who are not corrupt. When was the last time you ever heard of a judge in any way being connected to disreputable or corrupt behaviour, taking money to affect the outcome of a case? This doesn’t happen in Britain. Similarly, it’s quite rare actually, for lawyers to be involved in that kind of behaviour.

And of course, once you start taking a side to legal aid, where people are not paid properly and don’t feel that their professionalism is being respected, the temptations then for people to take additional monies from clients in addition to Legal Aid, to make their services available, can become high. That’s how you sow the seeds of corruption. We had our own period of corruption back and the early 18th century to the early 19th century. There was corruption amongst our judiciary. But the way that we resolved that was to give status to the judiciary, often when at the highest level, they were made members of the House of Lords and given the title of Lord. They were made knights when they sat on the High Court or the Court of Appeal. That independence came from giving those sorts of protections to judges, and what we expected in return was independent, committed service to the law and to justice. But I’m afraid we’re likely to lose that respect around the world if we don’t take care of it, and that means protecting lawyers and judges. Also, we need to nurture lawyers to become those judges, those independent ethical, non-corrupt judges.

One of the things that brings it home to me most strongly is my work internationally. Now, being me, I’ve been involved with the International Bar Association, but before, I became the Director of the Institute for Human Rights. One of the things that we know as we do work protecting lawyers and judges who are at risk, we know that what happens is that authoritarian, populist governments go after the courts, they go after lawyers because they want to take them under their own control. We see the judiciary being captured in places where the judiciary become too frightened to ever find against the state. The courts almost become rubber stamps in doing the bidding of the state. You see the fear that is inculcated in the legal profession. I’ve been involved in cases where I couldn’t get a firm of lawyers in countries to take on cases against corruptly leading figures in politics of that country, or even when it’s come to sexual violation of women, not been able to find lawyers who are prepared to take the cases because they were fearful of the consequences of taking on power. So we really have to recognise that if you start attacking lawyers for the work that they’re doing properly and ethically for their clients, then we’re in trouble. And it’s that generalisation, of course from time to time you find that there are bad lawyers, and they should be properly brought before their professional bodies if necessary, and in the right circumstances, they should be prosecuted. But you don’t generalize whole categories of lawyers as if they’re corrupt or doing work that is not in the national interest.

And I have the privilege of being the President of the Council of JUSTICE. JUSTICE is a fantastic organisation of lawyers across the United Kingdom, and it really does do very interesting work on reforming sections of our legal system, doing the preparatory work and the research to make it available to the senior judiciary, to make it available to government, for them to consider sensible reform that is not going to interfere with the fundamental principles that pin down the rule of law.

We often provide what’s called amicus curiae briefs [1], supportive briefs, and we have those written by really fantastic legal brains and serious intellectuals in the field of law. JUSTICE is a great organisation. It’s not the least bit political. It’s got lawyers from across the political space, I mean, except for lunatics who might not want to be involved in it. I mean if you’re an anarchist who doesn’t believe in law you wouldn’t belong to JUSTICE. If you’re on the far right here and an extreme libertarian, you might not want to be involved in law reform because you don’t think that the law should be impinging on your freedoms. But it’s sensible. Your lawyers across the political space support JUSTICE, and they are concerned about what’s happening in our country. How can I speak out about China and call out to China for its breach of international law in the Sino-British Treaty when the UK left Hong Kong? It made a commitment that it was going to be one nation with two systems, and it was going to respect democracy and the rule of law, and it’s become very clear that they’re not wanting to do that. They started by wanting to have extradition proceedings so they could have people that they wanted dealt with in their courts extradited to China.

How can I call out China’s interference in the system of law and the system of democracy in Hong Kong if we ourselves are being dismissive of treaties that we’ve signed? We signed the Brexit treaty; we signed a treaty with the European Union, which was that we were departing but on a certain basis. And then the next minute we want to tear it up. We can’t do that. International treaties have meaning, and they’re lodged with the UN. It was shocking to watch that going on. Then you’re seeing that happening with the Refugee Convention. There’s an argument to be made, and I tend not to agree with it, but there’s an argument to be made about whether the Refugee Convention is fit for purpose in the 21st century. People being persecuted should be able to flee to a new place and to be given sanctuary. But it may be that what we’re seeing in relation to climate change, people fleeing the torment of fire and brimstone and flood to want to get to a safe place, and it may be that the world has to think again. But in seeking to think about that, you know, there’s the big issues about what our responsibilities might be in that and the legal responsibilities that there might be too, but the solution is not to sort of tear up a commitment to provide a haven for those who are being persecuted. And so I just feel that our willingness to tear these things up follows in the footsteps of Trump and follows in the footsteps of Viktor Orban in Hungary, and indeed, even more spoke like Putin in Russia or Lukashenko in Belarus, who have no interest in the rule of law.

JURIST: We have been reporting the rule of law in crisis. More and more at the moment, we see that crises are popping up left, right and centre across the world, like Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. And this culture of impunity for states to commit atrocity and commit human rights violations on the territory of other states wherever they feel necessary, with this total lack of regard for international norms and the rules-based order, how do you see in terms of those current threats, which we see to this rules-based order and the rule of law internationally? Where do you see that heading?

Baroness Kennedy: Well, first of all, we’ve got to see, where do I see it coming from? And where I see it coming from is that globalisation was something that we’ve largely been greeting as a very positive thing in our world, and we thought it would involve helping poorer parts of the world to come out from under, to have their own development strategies and to be assisted by the rich world in that development. Unfortunately, that hasn’t happened. But we’ve seen how reckless greed led to an economic crisis in 2008, which affected the whole of the world, and so the triumph that came after the end of the Cold War when the Soviet Union collapsed. We saw the burgeoning of democracies was a great moment. I mean, many of us felt so excited about the fact that, you know, the juntas in Latin America had collapsed, that apartheid had ended in South Africa. I mean, looking at the end of the 90s, I was feeling very positive about the state of our world, but I think it was premature. And there was a bit of triumphalism about not just the fact that we felt that democracy had and the yearnings for people to have the freedoms that come with a genuine democracy. What we ended up with were 40 democracies in places like Russia, and we also let the market rip.

So instead of successful global markets and markets developing in places where there never had been free markets before, what we got was criminal enterprises and people enriching themselves in the most gross and unforgiving ways at the expense of ordinary people. And the creation of sort of plutocrats and oligarchs and people who swaggered in their richness, and we in the West, you know, took advantage of some of that. That’s not been dismissive. So I think that our world has come through a thing of, you know, a very sort of immature celebration of money, and money being the most important value. And we’re coming to realise that there was a folly in a lot of that and the economic model that was adopted around the world has certainly not shared out and distributed some of the riches that have been created by developments like technology.

And so for me, you can’t talk about law unless you understand your politics, and I always say to my team who work with me in at the institute or to my young colleagues in my chambers. I always say, and when I’m speaking to students obviously, look at the maps. Look at who’s next door to who. Look at what’s happening. Make sure you’re reading widely, not nonsense on social media, but read from reliable sources the things that are going on in different parts of the world and why. And so I feel that that the undermining and the rule of law position, which is fragile now, is because we have seen a kind of, if you like a turning against globalisation, the rise of nationalisms, putting up walls and wanting to look after number one, and not realising the solutions to so many problems, I mean, collaboration and internationalism as a way of doing many things. But people who run authoritarian governments don’t like law, especially if the law holds them to account, and so they don’t like their critics in the media. They don’t like the lawyers who represent their opponents, and they assume that those lawyers are sort of up to the eyeballs in colluding and conspiring to bring down the government as well. And so you end up having judges who can sometimes even if they’re not obviously captured, and policemen that are appointed by the president or Premier, start feeling the chill winds of what’s going on in the nation and start being very compliant. So the judges don’t even know they’re doing it, but they don’t rock any boats, and they take great care. And they think they’re doing it to protect the law. But in fact, in many ways, it’s about self-protection. One can understand the psychology of that, but I’m afraid it’s not good for law.

JURIST: No, absolutely. I agree. I think the rise in authoritarian structures is huge at the moment. And on that point I wanted to ask you: the UK just has recently determined that the treatment of Yazidis is indeed a genocide, something which you’ve worked on relentlessly over the last few years alongside other lawyers at the IBA like Ewelina Occhab, who I interviewed for JURIST a few months back. Could you give us a comment on your work and what this means for the Yazidi people?

Baroness Kennedy: Well, one of the terrible things is that the Yazidi were sort of friendless in that region. Their position was almost like that of the Roma in Eastern Europe, you know, or indeed Jews in the 20s and 30s, where people suddenly are being blamed for all manner of things that have nothing to do with them, or they’re seen as being lesser or they are marginalised within societies. And the Yazidi, you see, because they were of a very ancient religion, not one of the monotheistic religions, because they seem so separate and lived in a in a very different way, they faced the hostility of Syria, Turkey and Iraq, but they were basically a people who were held separate.

And so when ISIL you know, the Islamic State folk arrived on the scene in that region and we’re determined to set up an Islamic state going back to an ancient form of the caliphate and were deriding democracy and certainly deriving the rule of law as we know it. The Yazidi were in their way and became an easy target for them. And so they decided to annihilate them. And they were looking for space of course in which to create that caliphate. And so, the beheading and slaughtering of the men and boys, the enslavement of the women and girls and the sexual abuse and treating of people as less than human was just a terrible, terrible thing to document. I went out and spent time with the Yazidi with youth, particularly with Yadizi women in the camps in Erbil and the Sinjar region, and I met with many of those women who had been impregnated and had babies and loved those babies because they were so alone and separate and then had to abandon those babies in camps because their own people didn’t want to have the children of the people who had slaughtered so many of them. So you create a monster in here, and it was a genocide. I mean, it was undoubtedly about extermination. And the ghastly thing is that we see that as wanting to really destroy the humanity of a people.

I did a report very recently on the Hazara in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Hazara are a minority religion; they are some form of Shia, but they’re certainly not part of the dominant form of Islam in Afghanistan or Pakistan. And they are absolutely marginalised but worse than marginalised. They really are at the receiving end of the most terrible persecution. And of course, when NATO troops, the United States and the UK pulled out of Afghanistan. The Hazara were not high on the list of people who needed to be saved. And yet, they are at the front line of the slaughter. And I became involved as you know, in relation to the women, the women judges and lawyers and so forth, and some of them were Hazara. But what’s happening to the Hazara people continues to be really horrifying.

And you have the Uyghur in China and the Rohingya. A signal of what is genocide is what is done to women, the business of impregnating women, so that they are producing children that are not going to be seen as being of their community. The orchestrated sterilisation or abortions forced on women, the sexual abuse and violation of women so that they become filled with shame and mortification. I mean, it’s just horrible. And that is always a signal of armies or dominant forces that are in the process of completing a genocide. And when we say in the Genocide Convention, we were committing to preventing genocide not waiting till it’s happened. When we see signals of it happening, our duty is to act, to act to prevent.

JURIST: Absolutely, that was going to be my last question. Also, yesterday was Hazara Genocide Memorial Day, which commemorates the atrocities committed against the Hazara under the reign of Abdur Rahman Khan in the 1800s. And again, we see that continuing today under the Taliban. I was going to ask this, you’ve already answered it, but how pressing is the need to keep eyes on Afghanistan and indeed, start to help prevent the genocide of the Hazaras. The sort of early warning signs is something that we talked about often, and we never seem to get to the point where we act on early warning and prevent the possibility of genocide. So how pressing is it to recognise the genocide of the Hazaras?

Baroness Kennedy: One of the questions that I’m constantly asked is, do we do we talk to China? Do we talk to the Saudi Arabians? Do we talk to the Taliban? My answer to that is, of course, we keep doors open because we’re never gonna get anywhere unless we actually try to change minds. I’m a firm believer in the hearts and minds business of trying to get people to see why our shared humanity and protecting our shared humanity has to be one of the ground rules if we want to create a peaceful world, but I don’t see that as my job. You know, my job is to call out the horrors and to tell people the stories of what’s happening as a human rights lawyer and to seek to get justice for the people who have suffered.

So when it was in regard to what’s happening in Afghanistan, just I mean, I happen to see and believe, and I’m totally convinced that the right word to use is apartheid. Apartheid was about keeping people apart, treating people as second-class citizens, not respecting their humanity and denying people by virtue of some identifying factor, the colour of their skin, their sex or gender or sexuality, denying people participation in society, the sort of participation which means this is my home, this is the place in which I live or this is my nation. And not to allow them participation, freedom of movement, freedom of association, freedom to work or freedom to be educated. All that’s been denied to the women and minority peoples in Afghanistan by the Taliban. So in conversations with the Taliban, those have to be constantly at the forefront. I mean, it’s so bad. It’s so bad in Afghanistan, that we should be doing as we did with South Africa, we should be building a coalition of people that are going to boycott the Taliban and make it clear to them that what they’re doing is a crime, and that they’re not going to be supported to develop as a nation until they do something about it. And eventually, you get people who get the message. Some people say to me, “you’re just going to drive the Taliban into harder positions.” Now, we can do business on many different fronts, but my role in all of this as a lawyer is to talk about justice and to talk about how justice can be secured for people who have been denied justice. And my God did I see up close when I was working with the Afghan women who were going to be killed. And indeed, two senior judges were assassinated, women judges on the Supreme Court. So we mustn’t imagine that the regime is somehow going to be persuaded easily to start respecting the rule of law and human rights.

And I have a problem, for example, with Saudi Arabia. You know, I was involved in the investigation into the assassination and extrajudicial killing, because that’s what it was, of Jamal Khashoggi. And I heard that man being killed as if I was in the room with him. It was horrifying to hear that the recognition by him that he was facing death. It was horrible. And to know that they then desecrated his body and cut it up and they had planned it. They brought a pathologist with them. And then the pathologist, before the cutting up, was cross about the fact that he was going to be bad for his back that he was going to have to do on the floor.

JURIST News: I recently spoke with REDRESS Trust and with Matthew Hedges who was tortured in the United Arab Emirates on his condition, and treatment, and Saudi Arabia is another rogue state with complete impunity. What is your position again on such rogue states?

Baroness Kennedy: Here we are in a world where the United Kingdom has left the European Union, our nearest neighbour, and so we want trade and we want trade with China and so forth. Do we pretend that human rights have got nothing to do with what’s happening? They’ll be happy to go into trading relations and not to talk about the fact that there are things going on that we feel you know, I’m not speaking to the best part of the Chinese people. I know lots of Chinese people who are perfectly decent folk, but I mean what the state does is appalling. And the same thing we’re about to entertain Mohammed bin Salman, roll out the red carpet for him for a state visit. No. I don’t mind our ambassadors going and speaking to him and talking to him about the importance of his oil in dealing with this Ukraine-Russia war since, you know, a lot of Europe can’t get its oil in the ordinary way from Russia, because it did. And so therefore, Saudis are being expected to step up. The Saudis are making trillions out of stepping up, and they’re not doing it as a charitable exercise. You know, are they playing a proper role in the world? Are they behaving like a decent state? And then you get the long arm of the state going off and killing people.

And we’ve just seen you know, this happening in so many places. Somebody from my own country, Scotland, a Sikh named Jagtar Singh Johal, living and brought up in Scotland, went out to India in order to marry and to meet his bride, and he was arrested and has been in jail for six years on the basis that he used to speak publicly about wanting to see an independent state for Sikhs, you know, rather like from Scotland, my home country, but at least they don’t get thrown in jail for saying it. And, you know, we have to call this stuff out for what it is.

1142833507,20231127,"The Palestinian foreign minister has appealed for an indefinite truce in the war between Israel and Hamas. “We have to count the dead. We have to protect the innocent. Seventy per cent of the dead in Gaza are women and children and this can’t go on,” foreign affairs minister of the Palestinian National Authority Riyad al-Maliki told reporters. “We have to work to extend the ceasefire so that it is permanent.”

Under a four-day truce agreement that began on Friday, Hamas agreed to release people kidnapped in its deadly October 7th assault on Israeli border communities, while Israel agreed to release prisoners.

Before last-minute negotiations appeared to have secured a two-day extension to the truce, ministers from Europe, the Middle East and North Africa gathered to discuss the conflict at a meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean in Barcelona, Spain.

Israel did not attend the conference, while Palestine was represented by the Palestinian Authority, the more moderate rival to Hamas that rules in the West Bank. Though ministers were hopeful the truce could be extended by additional days, there were also fears that sooner or later the bombardment by Israel and firing of rockets by Hamas would resume.

Mr al-Maliki warned that any bombing would now be more deadly as the civilian population of Gaza has clustered in a smaller area in the south of the strip, where they were ordered to go after being told to evacuate the north of the strip.

“The truce came about when there were 15,000 victims. If the war goes on tomorrow this means the number will double because of the concentration of the Palestinian population,” he said. “Any Israeli attack that would have killed one child will now kill two.”

The dozens of countries that attended the summit agreed that international law must be respected, that adequate humanitarian aid must enter Gaza, and that its population should not be driven out of the territory.

“We agreed that there should be no more killing. So call it a humanitarian pause, call it a ceasefire, call it whatever you want to call it, as long as the killing stops,” Jordan’s deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs Ayman Al-Safadi said.

He warned that the conflict was doing deep damage to the prospects of a peaceful resolution, and that progress needed to be made swiftly to bring about a two-state solution, which he described as the only way to guarantee Israel’s security. “We in the Arab world, in the Muslim world, have unequivocally condemned the killing of Israeli civilians on October 7th. But as deep as the pain is, as blinding as the outrage is, they cannot make the killing of 15,000 Palestinians, over 6,000 of them children, acceptable,” Mr Al-Safadi said.

The European Union’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell described the death toll in Gaza as “disproportionate”, and said that “most of the public opinion around the world” considered it unacceptable. “Gaza is more or less like Barcelona, 2.5 million people. Just imagine half of the city being turned into rubble.”"

1142850620,20231127,"A two-state solution would be the answer to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, officials of Arab states and the European Union agreed at a meeting in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday.

They said the Palestinian Authority, rather than Hamas, should rule Gaza.

European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said during the meeting in Barcelona that all EU members and almost everyone else attending agreed on the need for a two-state solution.

The Palestinian Authority must hold elections and improve its governance, but it is the only ""viable solution"" to the future leadership of Gaza to avoid a ""power vacuum,"" Borrell said.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the Palestinian people should decide who rules them and that any talk of administration of Gaza after the conflict should focus on the West Bank and Gaza as one entity.

A two-state solution envisages a state for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said the Palestinian Authority, which lost control of the Gaza Strip in a 2007 power struggle with Hamas, had no need to return to Gaza, adding, ""We have been there all the time. We have 60,000 public workers there.""

The three officials spoke at the conclusion of a meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean, a 43-member grouping of European, North African and Middle Eastern countries.

Israel did not attend the summit. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan spoke as a representative of a group of ministers from the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

The original four-day truce between Israel and Hamas has been extended by 48 hours to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. This is the first lull in the seven weeks since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

In response to that attack, Israel bombarded the enclave and mounted a ground offensive in the north. Some 14,800 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced."
1142854589,20231127,"Agribusiness giant Cargill on Monday moved forward a goal to eliminate deforestation and land conversion from both direct and indirect supply chains in key South American countries, including Brazil, by five years.

The announcement impacts vital commodities — soy, corn, wheat and cotton — and comes just days before the start of COP28, the large global climate summit, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

""We are actively shaping a future where critical ecosystems will be protected for generations to come,"" Pilar Cruz, Cargill's chief sustainability officer, said in a statement.

But the push also comes after months of renewed and consistent criticism of the company by environmental groups — including protests at Cargill's Minnetonka headquarters — over its role in sourcing soy from Brazil's vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems.

When Michael Cordonnier arrived in Brazil's Matto Grosso state 50 years ago with the Peace Corps, he saw cattle ranches, dirt roads and Indigenous communities.

""Soybeans were photoperiodic,"" said Cordonnier, now an Illinois-based agronomist and grain consultant specializing in South America. ""When you're closer to the equator, you don't have that change [in sunlight to trigger flowering].""

But the bonanza was coming. In the ensuing decades, Brazil witnessed an explosion in soybeans, the utility crop used in fuels, plastics and animal feed. This growth brought many Brazilian farmers new prosperity as global commodity traders set up operations. But it also accelerated deforestation and climate change.

This tension — between local economic independence and the international battle against global warming — is increasingly landing at the doorstep of the powerful middlemen, including Cargill, that buy the crops and create new markets for the product.

Cargill has made a number of pledges aimed at eliminating deforestation — some it has kept, others it has not. Monday's pledge addresses some recent criticisms that the company hasn't been aggressive enough in tamping down on environmentally harmful industry practices.

Since 1965, the global grain trader with a $177 billion in revenue last year has been buying and selling grain from farmers in Brazil. In the last few years, Cargill surpassed rival Bunge as the largest exporting trader of soybeans in Brazil.

Rather than focusing on the buyers — such as Chinese hog producers that use the soymeal for feed — or the growers and speculators clearing the land, many critics and activists have applied public pressure to these grain buyers to thwart deforestation and the clearing of virgin lands in the region.

""What's the point of naming and shaming what some dude in Brazil does versus the American capitalist who is trying to get the lowest price from what that guy is marketing to some tofu producer in China?"" said David Samuels, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota who studies Brazil. ""[Cargill's a] privately held company. It's a family that controls it.""

Lisa Rausch, a scientist for the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said speculators sell parcels to cattle producers who graze animals for a few seasons. Within five years, the land is often covered by leafy, green soybeans.

This conversion tactic is a pernicious loophole to deforestation pledges, environmental groups say.

Increasingly, Cargill is responding to these calls for accountability with public commitments.

Earlier this month, Cargill released its annual environmental, social and governance (ESG) report, reiterating its pledge made in 2022 to end deforestation — but not conversion — in its South American soy supply chain by 2025. Conversion in this region, the company pledged, would end by 2030.

But Monday's announcement shortens that timeline, making its entire soy supply deforestation- and conversion-free in the next two years.

They're also spending $100 million to equip Brazilian farmers with technical help, restore farmed lands and create a complex, satellite-based map of their South American soy supply chain as a way to track land changes.

""I'm pleased to say that we have mapped out 100% of our supply chain's direct suppliers in Brazil, which I think is huge because now we can see it,"" Cargill's Cruz told the Star Tribune in July. ""When there's a deviation or suppliers are not following our policies, then, of course, we take action.""

Last year alone, Cargill blocked nearly 1,500 farms for violating environmental protocols or labor laws. But environmental and Indigenous groups have so far remained unimpressed by the company's voluntary pledges.

Speaking at a June news conference near Cargill's headquarters, Todd Paglia, executive director of environmental group Stand.Earth, said, ""Cargill presents both the greatest opportunity and the greatest obstacle to removing the destruction of nature from the agricultural supply chain.""

Brazil, once known for bananas and coffee beans, now has more than a billion acres in arable land, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

In 2017, Brazil surpassed the U.S. as the world's top soybean exporter. In 2023, they'll do the same with corn.

""They can grow two, sometimes three crops in any one year,"" said Joe Smentek, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association executive director. ""And they don't face nearly any of the environmental regulations that we face in Minnesota.""

Most of this growth has happened on land once relatively untouched by humans. More than a quarter of all Brazil's soybeans are planted in Matto Grosso, a state blanketed by rainforest, savanna and wetlands.

In 2006, the world's largest grain traders — from Cargill to Bunge and Brazil's Amaggi — enacted the soy moratorium, curtailing logging for new soybean fields in the Amazon rainforest, the world's biggest carbon sink.

But that moratorium, Rausch said, doesn't apply in the Cerrado, a biodiverse savanna to the rainforest's east.

During the past decade, researchers have watched the soybean market expand.

""In 2017, the acreage was about 32 million hectares, right on part with the U.S. It's now 45 million [acres],"" said Matthew Hansen, director of the Global Land Analysis and Discovery laboratory at the University of Maryland. ""You're already number one in the world. Then you increase it by a third.""

The boom has meant steady business for a bevy of trading giants.

When a soybean is crushed, its oil provides the basis for biodiesel and food. Most soybean meal, however, feeds livestock. Some 70% of Brazil's exported soybeans are shipped to feed pigs in China.

""Brazil is probably one of the most important countries, as it relates to production of agricultural commodities that feed the world,"" Cargill's Cruz said.

But critics — and even some customers — say food production is also destroying ecosystems.

A decade ago, the world's largest food merchants pledged to end deforestation by 2020. But in the summer of 2019, Cargill announced the Consumer Goods Forum, which also includes General Mills and McDonald's, would miss the goal, citing the problem's complexity.

""Protocols are usually voluntary. There's no penalty associated with them,"" Hansen said. ""You can see these protocols are not doing so great.""

The European Union is now requiring traders to remove deforestation from supply lines for cocoa, rubber and soy. Other nations, such as Norway, have sought to remove not only deforestation from their soy consumption but also conversion.

In June, individuals with Stand.Earth, headquartered in San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, delivered boxes of documents — one for each of the family members who collectively own more than 80% of Cargill — to the company's Minnesota base, accusing the company of falling short of its own commitments.

Months later, in October, the group accompanied Beka Munduruku, an Indigenous leader and climate activist from the Amazon basin, as she spoke outside Cargill's headquarters.

""I have never seen … the huge amounts of dust that come in a place that was green before,"" Munduruku said. ""They're killing the forest.""

This latest campaign coincides with a revival in environmental protections by Brazil's federal government.

A year ago, Brazilian voters returned leftist former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to the presidency, ousting Jair Bolsonaro, a nationalist who drew international condemnation when wildfires engulfed the nation in 2019.

During Lula's first six months, deforestation in the rainforest fell by 33.6%, with increased enforcement of the country's forest protections.

But agricultural activities in the land-rich, low-cost country account for nearly 30% of Brazil's GDP.

For comparison, the U.S. ag and food sector makes up a little more than 5% of the nation's GDP.

""Domestic politics is being different from the previous president and his lawless approach to deforestation,"" Samuels said. ""But [Lula's] not going to shut down the expansion of agriculture.""

Cargill's latest ESG report published this month, announcing 94% of direct suppliers of soy in Brazil are deforestation- and conversion-free.

But direct suppliers, the company acknowledges, represent 64% of the total volume of soy Cargill handles from Brazil. More than a third of the total soy sellers — or more than 5,000 suppliers — are indirect.

Cargill seeks to promote ""due diligence"" across the soy sector, so farmers and sellers have common expectations, regardless of whether they're selling to Cargill or another trader. By the 2024 growing season, indirect suppliers will be held accountable for sustainable cropping practices, the company says.

Western grain traders arrived in Brazil in the mid-20th century to develop resources, plant crops and raise cattle. They've outlasted presidential administrations and even constitutions. But climate change may be their thorniest challenge yet.

Antonio Ioris, a professor at Cardiff University in Wales and a writer on Brazilian politics, said global ag firms operating in Brazil are the one constant.

""Agribusiness is the real power,"" Ioris said. ""They are the real rulers of the universe in Brazil.""

But Ioris and others note a heating planet has meant less dense precipitation cycles in places such as the Amazon, frustrating farmers and merchants alike. Agribusinesses have taken note.

All the major South American soy buyers — ArcherDaniels-Midland, Bunge, China's state-owned COFCO — have made pledges to end deforestation from their supply lines. But unpacking these pledges can be difficult.

In July, after being asked why Cargill has not pursued more aggressive pledges, Cruz recited a statistic.

""There are about 800 million people in the world who go to sleep hungry,"" Cruz said. ""Doing the math, by the time we finish this half-an-hour discussion, 450 people would have died because they don't have access to food.""

Meanwhile, farmers keep planting soybeans in South America. Weeks ago, the USDA released another report on Brazil's farmers, projecting another record harvest.

""South America makes the soybean market,"" Cordonnier said. ""Brazil will continue to expand soybean production for the rest of our lifetimes."""

1142865219,20231128,"LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - A Virgin Atlantic passenger jet flying from London to New York powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will take off on Tuesday, as the aviation world seeks to showcase the potential of low carbon options to secure its future.

As the world de-carbonises, airlines are banking on fuel made from waste to reduce their emissions by up to 70%, enabling them to keep operating before electric and hydrogen-powered air travel becomes a reality in the decades to come.

The flight operated by a Virgin Boeing 787 powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, will be the first time a commercial airline has flown long haul on 100% SAF.

It follows the successful transatlantic crossing by a Gulfstream G600 business jet using the same fuel last week.

Virgin Atlantic's billionaire founder Richard Branson, the airline's chief executive Shai Weiss, and Britain's transport minister Mark Harper will all be on board the flight scheduled to leave London Heathrow at 1130 GMT and arrive at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 1440 EST.

There will be no paying passengers on board or cargo on what Virgin has dubbed Flight100, which comes days before the start of COP28 climate talks in Dubai on Thursday.

SAF is already used in jet engines as part of a blend with traditional kerosene, but after successful ground tests, Virgin and its partners Rolls-Royce, Boeing, BP and others won permission to fly using only SAF.

Aviation accounts for an estimated 2-3% of global carbon emissions. SAF is key toward reducing those emissions, but it is costly and accounts for less than 0.1% of total global jet fuel in use today.

The fuel used to power Tuesday's flight is mostly made from used cooking oil and waste animal fat mixed with a small amount of synthetic aromatic kerosene made from waste corn, Virgin Atlantic said.

Many European airlines - including Virgin, IAG -owned British Airways, and Air France - have said they want to be using 10% SAF by 2030, and the industry's goal of ""net zero"" emissions by 2050 relies on that share rising to 65%.

Yet the 2030 target looks challenging given SAF's small volumes and its high cost, right now about three to five times as much as regular jet fuel.

In October, the head of IAG warned that there was more than a 90% risk the industry would not meet the European Union mandate for SAF availability in 2025.

""(Fuel substitutes) are nowhere close to being scalable in the necessary timeframe to avoid climate collapse. What is urgently needed is to reduce the burning of fossil jet fuels, which means reducing flights wherever possible,"" said Magdalena Heuwieser, who represents the network.

The aviation industry hopes that the Virgin Atlantic flight will highlight to governments the need for them to provide financial support to make SAF more readily available.

Virgin said the engines on the flight would be drained of SAF and tested before it returns to service using regular fuel."

1142880879,20231128,"An official said Blinken would “stress the need to sustain the increased flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza,” among other priorities.

BRUSSELS — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will return this week to the Middle East to explore the possibility of further extensions of the cease-fire agreement in Gaza, a senior State Department official said Monday. It will be his third trip to the region since Israel’s war with Hamas terrorists began last month.

Blinken will travel to Israel and the West Bank after attending Ukraine-focused meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday in Brussels and Skopje, where foreign ministers from NATO and the Organization for Peace and Security in Europe are gathering, the official said.

The official spoke to reporters traveling with Blinken on condition of anonymity before a State Department announcement.

In Israel, Blinken will see Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of his war Cabinet to discuss the current situation in Gaza and the potential for further extensions of the cease-fire under which Israel has agreed to pauses in its military operations in exchange for the gradual release of hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel.

The first agreement had been due to expire on Monday but was extended for an additional two days, meaning the extension will be expiring just as Blinken is arriving in Israel.

The official said Blinken would “stress the need to sustain the increased flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, secure the release of all hostages, and improve protections for civilians in Gaza.”

In addition, the official said Blinken would discuss the principles for a post-conflict Gaza if and when Israel succeeds in its campaign to eradicate Hamas, as well as underscore the need to establish an independent Palestinian state as the only long-term solution for peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians.

Blinken will also visit Ramallah in the occupied West Bank to see Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Blinken and other U.S. officials have said they believe the Palestinian Authority should play a significant role in governing post-conflict Gaza.

From Israel and the West Bank, Blinken will travel to the United Arab Emirates for discussions with regional leaders who will be in Dubai to attend the COP28 climate summit, the official said.

Blinken has been engaged in furious diplomacy to try to prevent the Gaza conflict from spreading, expand the provision of humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in the territory, secure the release of hostages and arrange for foreigners and dual nationals to leave Gaza overland to Egypt.

On each of his prior two trips, Blinken has traveled to Israel and Jordan multiple times. Between the two trips, he also made stops in Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE.

Blinken will arrive in Israel having just participated in an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe foreign ministers meeting in Skopje, North Macedonia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said he plans to attend the OSCE meeting, possibly setting the stage for a U.S.-Russia confrontation there over Ukraine.

In Brussels, Blinken will attend the two-day NATO gathering, which will include the first foreign minister-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a body created by alliance leaders at their last summit to improve cooperation and coordination and help prepare Kyiv for eventual membership.

“Allies will continue to support Ukraine’s self-defense until Russia stops its war of aggression,” said Jim O’Brien, the top U.S. diplomat for Europe.

The NATO meeting will also address the tensions in the Western Balkans, where there are calls for NATO to increase its military presence in response to concerns that hostility between Serbia and Kosovo could escalate to outright conflict.

Violence between the two has broken out twice in recent months, and Western countries fear that Russia could try to foment trouble in the Balkans to avert attention from the war in Ukraine.

Last week, Albania’s prime minister urged NATO to further boost its military forces in Kosovo and secure the country’s borders with Serbia, warning that recent ethnic violence in Kosovo could potentially trigger a wider Balkan conflict. NATO has already strengthened its military presence in Kosovo — established after the 1999 bombing campaign against Serbia — with about 1,000 additional troops and heavier weaponry, bringing its deployment there to about 4,500 troops.

Blinken will underscore U.S. and NATO support for democracy and stability in the region, including a commitment to back all countries’ aspirations to join the European Union, O’Brien said.

Serbia doesn’t recognize Kosovo’s formal declaration of independence in 2008. Both countries want to join the European Union, which is mediating a dialogue between the former foes. Brussels has warned both that refusal to compromise jeopardizes their chances of joining the bloc.

The NATO ministers will also discuss plans for the alliance’s 75th anniversary summit to be held in Washington in July 2024."
1142880881,20231128,"GAZA/JERUSALEM — Egyptian, Qatari and US negotiators closed in on an extension of a four-day truce in Gaza that expired on Monday, Egyptian security sources said, amid rising international pressure to roll over a deal which has paused seven weeks of fighting.

Palestinian group Hamas is seeking a four-day extension while Israel wants day-by-day extensions, with negotiations continuing over which Palestinian prisoners would be freed, the sources said.

An Israeli official earlier reiterated Israel’s position that it would agree to an extra day of truce for each additional 10 hostages freed and to release three times the number of Palestinians each time. The number of additional days is capped at five, the official added.

A Palestinian official, familiar with the truce talks, said both Hamas and Israel had shown a positive attitude to requests to extend the pause in fighting, but added that “a final decision hasn’t yet been reached.”

On Sunday, Hamas freed 17 people, including a 4-year-old Israeli-American girl, bringing the total number the militant group has released since Friday to 58, including foreigners.

Israel freed 39 teenage Palestinian prisoners on Sunday, taking the total number of Palestinians freed under the truce to 117.

Under the terms of the current deal, Hamas is due to release in total 50 Israeli women and children held hostage in Gaza, which means that 11 remained to be freed on Monday.

There is no limit in the deal on the number of foreigners it can release.

An Israeli government spokesperson said on Monday that the total number of hostages still held in Gaza was now 184, including 14 foreigners and 80 Israelis with dual nationality.

Both Israel and Hamas raised concerns over Monday’s lists and Qatari mediators were working with them to resolve the issues and avoid delays, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it was reviewing the list of Palestinian prisoners it had received from Hamas for release on Monday and would provide further information when possible.

Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan, speaking to Lebanon’s LBC broadcaster, said the group would try to find more hostages to release and thus prolong the truce. Hamas has previously said it is not holding all the hostages who were brought to Gaza.

Once the truce ends, Netanyahu said at the weekend, “we will return with full force to achieve our goals: the elimination of Hamas; ensuring that Gaza does not return to what it was; and of course the release of all our hostages.”

Palestinians in Gaza said on Monday they were praying for an extension of the truce. Some were visiting homes reduced to rubble by weeks of intensive Israeli bombardment, while others queued for flour and other essential aid being delivered by the United Nations’ relief agency UNRWA.

The al-Sultan family, among hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes in the north of the Gaza Strip, snatched a few hours of sorely needed relaxation by the sea.

“We used these four days (of truce) and came to the beach in Deir Al-Balah to allow our children to have some fun,” their mother, Hazem Al Sultan, said. “We are anticipating the end of these four days, and we don’t know what will happen to us next.”

Palestinians gave the freed prisoners a jubilant reception in Ramallah, according to Palestinian news agency WAFA.

Omar Abdullah Al Hajj, 17, released on Sunday, told Reuters he’d been kept in the dark about what was happening in the outside world.

“We were 11 people crammed into a single room where usually there are six. There was never enough food and I was never told how long I was going to stay,” he said.

“I can’t believe I’m free now but my joy is incomplete because we still have our brothers who remain in prison,” said Al Hajj, whom Israel’s Justice Ministry accused of belonging to the Islamic Jihad militant group and posing a security threat which it did not specify.

The truce agreed last week is the first halt in fighting in the seven weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages back into Gaza.

In response to that attack, Israel has bombarded the enclave and mounted a ground offensive in the north. Some 14,800 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced.

Qatar, Egypt, the United States, the European Union and Spain were all working to extend the ceasefire, the Palestinian Authority’s foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, said during a conference in Barcelona devoted to the crisis.

Al-Maliki, whose Authority runs the occupied West Bank, told the Forum for the Union of the Mediterranean that the international community must pressure Israel to extend the truce indefinitely. The death toll would double if war resumes on Tuesday, he added.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, told the same conference the current truce was an important first step but that far more would be needed to alleviate the situation.

Borrell also urged Israel not to “recolonize Gaza,” saying that the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza was the best guarantee of Israel’s peace and security. – Reuters"

At least half of this money would be transferred to a trust fund in Ukraine and the contract would be terminated if those rules were violated. Exporters are also obliged to notify their national authorities of any violations by companies in third countries.

However, diplomats from some major EU member states raised concerns over the proposal. Some EU members also want to reduce the number of goods that can be covered, fearing the new proposal will put European companies at a disadvantage.

Bloomberg previously reported that the new sanctions may involve 5 billion euros ($5.47 billion) of trade. It said the EU is considering banning exports of welding machines, chemicals and technologies that can be used for military purposes, and restricting imports of processed metals and aluminum products, as well as diamonds. The bloc is also considering adding more goods to the ban list and bringing relevant companies in third countries under the sanctions.

The Wall Street Journal quoted EU officials as saying the EU executive body issued a new round of sanctions against Russia on Nov 14, but diplomats said it could take weeks for all 27 member states to adopt the measures.

The 11 rounds of sanctions the EU has imposed on Russia cover energy, economy, trade and other areas. However, according to Russia's official statistics service Rosstat, the country's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the third quarter of 2023, which is better than its previous official assessment. Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, recently forecast Russia's economy would grow three times faster than the eurozone in 2024."

1142908592,20231128,"As Bangladesh prepares for its 2024 general elections, the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has come under fresh review. The rule of the ruling Awami League (AL) and the systematic sidelining of opposition parties, particularly the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), could have repercussions on the multiparty structure.

The approach of the Jan. 7 elections has been marked by arrests of several BNP leaders and activists. The situation escalated following a huge BNP rally on Oct. 28, which resulted in violent clashes with the police and AL supporters. This led to the arrest of over thousands of opposition members in recent weeks in the lead-up to the general election.

Sheikh Hasina has been governing the nation of 175 million people since 2009. She first became Prime Minister in 1996 but lost power in 2001 when the BNP took over until 2008. She returned to power in 2009 following a landslide victory and was re-elected in 2014 and 2018. She is also expected to win the upcoming January 2024 election due to the absence of the opposition in the electoral fray.

While Hasina’s tenure has been marked by significant economic growth, it has also seen an increase in economic disparity. Since late October, coinciding with the political unrest led by the opposition, 4.4 million garment workers have been striking for higher wages.

Hasina’s tenure, particularly in recent years, has been characterised by a diminishing space for political dissent and opposition. The use of Digital Security Act, has been especially criticised for stifling free speech and silencing critics.

While Hasina-led AL continues to win elections after election in Bangladesh, the critical factor in her government’s electoral successes since 2014 has been a highly controversial constitutional amendment in 2011 regarding Bangladesh’s electoral system. This amendment eliminated the provision for a caretaker government to oversee general elections.

However, the 15th amendment to the Constitution in June 2011 abolished this system, leading to allegations of lack of fairness, and even the boycott of general elections by major opposition parties.

With the announcement of the general election scheduled for Jan. 7, 2024, not surprisingly, the opposition, spearheaded by the BNP is demanding Sheikh Hasina’s resignation and the establishment of an interim government to ensure fair elections.

Meanwhile the international response to Sheikh Hasina’s actions has been relatively subdued, partly because of Bangladesh’s strategic importance and its economic growth trajectory. It is situated between South and Southeast Asia, and its access to the Bay of Bengal is also strategically important for naval and shipping routes.

Bangladesh has shown remarkable economic resilience and growth over the past few decades. It has transitioned from being primarily an agrarian economy to a manufacturing hub, especially in textiles and garments, which is its largest export sector. Bangladesh almost hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world, particularly almost a million of the Rohingya from Myanmar.

The US has imposed sanctions on some senior Bangladeshi police figures for human rights violations and has urged dialogue to resolve the political deadlock. However, the chances of successful negotiations seem slim due to the entrenched positions of both sides.

A one-party rule should be avoided as this raises serious concerns about the future of pluralism in the country."
1142912292,20231128,"European Union regulators expressed concern over Amazon's acquisition of vacuum maker iRobot, saying the deal would harm competition.

The EU's executive arm and top antitrust enforcer, the European Commission, said it has already informed the e-commerce company of its ""preliminary view"" regarding the deal. This follows an investigation that started in July.

The acquisition news raised concerns from investors and sent shares in Bedford, Massachusetts-based iRobot Corp. down more than 17% on Monday. European regulators said the buyout could hinder the company's rivals from effectively competing in Amazon's marketplace.

They said it is an important platform for selling robot vacuum cleaners in various regions, including France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. If the acquisition deal goes through, the commission said that Amazon could be incentivized to prevent competitors from selling their products on its marketplace or make it more difficult for them to do so, as Yahoo News.

It added that, among other things, the e-commerce company could reduce the visibility of a competitor's product on its platform or limit access to certain labels. These include ""Amazon's Choice,"" which could help sellers attract more consumers.

Amazon could also find other ways to raise the costs of iRobot's rivals to advertise and sell their products on its marketplace. The commission has until Feb. 14 to make a final decision regarding the deal, and Amazon could respond to some of the objections that could be raised.

A spokesperson for Amazon, Alexandra Miller, said that the Seattle-based company is already working with the commission and is prioritizing addressing its questions. She noted that iRobot faces intense competition from other vacuum cleaner supplies but offers practical and inventive products.

The acquisition deal was announced in August of last year amid increased regulatory scrutiny around the world of Big Tech acquiring smaller rivals. According to Reuters, this particular effort could boost their market dominance or help them expand into other markets.

On top of concerns from the European Commission, the acquisition deal is also under review by the US Federal Trade Commission. In June, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority said that the deal would not result in a ""substantial lessening of competition"" in the UK.

The commission's announcement comes after iRobot's shares skyrocketed 39% on Friday after reports that the deal would ""win unconditional EU antitrust approval."" The report cited three sources who were familiar with the matter. On the other hand, an EU spokesperson declined to comment regarding the development, said CNBC.

The deal between Amazon and iRobot would have the former acquire the latter for roughly $1.7 billion. However, the deal's value declined by 15% after the vacuum maker company incurred new debt.

Amid the scrutiny by regulators, anti-monopoly organizations have also voiced their opposition to the Amazon-iRobot deal, arguing that it would broaden the e-commerce company's dominance in the smart home market, where it already holds significant influence. On Monday, the firm's stock finished up less than 1%.

1142914335,20231128,"Iraq sees a risk of regional conflict if the current truce in Gaza is not turned into a permanent ceasefire, the Iraqi prime minister's foreign affairs adviser said, as mediators sought an extension of the temporary four-day Israel-Hamas truce.

Israel's devastating bombardment of Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel has drawn in Iran-aligned armed groups in the region including Lebanese Hezbollah and several Iraqi factions, who have mounted near-daily attacks on Israeli and US forces.

But there have been no reports of attacks on US forces in Iraq or Syria since Israel and Hamas began a four-day truce last week that was set to expire on Monday, compared to over 70 in the weeks prior.

Some of the main Iraqi armed factions behind the recent attacks, including Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada and Kataeb Hezbollah, have announced they will abide by the Gaza ceasefire but indicated they would resume attacks if it ends.

They have also said in statements that they still seek the eventual ouster of US forces in Iraq. There are around 2,500 US troops on a mission the US says is to advise and assist Iraqi forces battling remnants of ISIS.

""The entire region is on the verge of a devastating conflict that may include everyone, and the extent of its expansion or how to control and stop it is not known,"" said Farhad Alaadin, foreign affairs adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.

""For this reason, we see any ceasefire in the conflict as beneficial and important at this stage for the people of Palestine and Gaza first and for all countries in the region, including Iraq,"" he told Reuters.

European Union Ambassador to Iraq Thomas Seiler said in a social media post that he hopes Iraqi factions ""continue with their cessation of attacks.""

Two sets of US strikes in Iraq last week killed 10 members of Kataeb Hezbollah, according to posts by the group on social media, a move condemned by the Iraqi government as escalatory and a violation of sovereignty.

Kataeb Hezbollah is part of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a group of mostly Shiite armed groups formed to fight ISIS in 2014 that became an official security agency under the command of the prime minister.

1142920914,20231128,"After seven weeks of struggling with a crisis that defies easy solutions, President Joe Biden could take solace in saving a single 4-year-old girl whose parents were killed in the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

But gratifying as it was to secure the release of Avigail Idan from her Hamas captors over the weekend, the challenge for Biden going forward is not only to free the rest of the Americans being held hostage but to use the success of recent days to alter the trajectory of the war consuming the Gaza Strip.

At the president’s urging, the two sides agreed Monday to extend the temporary pause in the war between Israel and Hamas two more days to allow the release of an additional 20 hostages, according to Qatar, the Persian Gulf emirate that has been serving as intermediary. That gives all sides more breathing space but only postpones the most critical question by another 48 hours — namely what happens whenever the negotiated pause eventually expires.

Israel has vowed to resume its withering assault on Hamas once the hostage releases end, and Biden has said repeatedly that the country has a right to defend itself after a terrorist attack that killed an estimated 1,200 people. At the same time, the president hopes to influence any fresh military action, ensuring that it is more targeted and does more to avoid civilian casualties. The White House has already warned Israel against moving into southern Gaza, where many Palestinians living in the coastal enclave have fled, without a concrete plan to protect civilians.

“Biden’s in a bind,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East negotiator now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “He’s tethered himself to Israel’s war aims — eradicating Hamas. But in view of the rising humanitarian catastrophe and the exponential rise in Palestinian deaths, he’s looking for ways to de-escalate and eventually for an exit ramp.”

“Freeing hostages is one way to try and extend the truce, get aid into Gaza and hostages out,” Miller added. “But there’s a moment of decision coming when Israel seeks to resume its ground campaign. Will he press Israel to stop or at least try to shape its operations in the south?”

The announcement Monday of a two-day extension in the truce came after a weekend of telephone diplomacy by Biden. He consulted with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, on Saturday, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Sunday.

In working to extend the pause and hostage releases, Biden has American interests to consider as well as those of Israel. Among the 240 hostages taken by Hamas, 10 were believed to be American. Among those released under the original deal brokered last week by Biden to free 50 hostages, the only American to be handed over so far has been Avigail, who has dual citizenship in the United States and Israel and whose name is often spelled Abigail in US media.

Two American women from that group had been expected to be among the hostages released Monday in the final stage of the initial deal between Israel and Hamas, but were not freed. That was a significant setback for Biden, who was already under criticism for failing to win the release of the vast majority of the American hostages.

Now the question will be whether any or all of the Americans will be among the hostages turned over during the two-day extension agreed to Monday. Israel has said it would extend the pause by a day for each 10 additional hostages released.

“We’re grateful that we’ve got an extra two days to work with here,” John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, said before it became known that no Americans would be released Monday. “That will result in the release of 20 more individuals, women and children.”

He added: “We’d certainly like to see even that extension extended further until all the hostages are released. That’s really the goal here. Get all the hostages home with their families where they belong however long that could take.”

Biden and his team, though, have been vague about what happens after that. “We’re going to continue to urge our Israeli counterparts as they plan to go back to military operations that they do it in the most discreet, deliberate, careful, cautious way possible,” Kirby said.

The longer the pause, the more time Hamas has to regroup in preparation for further Israeli assault, according to military experts. Jake Sullivan, the president’s national security adviser, acknowledged over the weekend that Hamas had exploited the hostage agreement to build itself back up after weeks of airstrikes and ground attacks by Israeli military forces.

“I can’t deny that Hamas gained some benefits from this deal,” Sullivan said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “One of them is the ability to refit and retool inside Gaza. Another is to try to use social media and other formats to generate some propaganda out of it.” But he added that the trade-off had been dozens of “innocent people coming out of Gaza to be reunited with their families.”

Republicans have offered mixed responses to the hostage deal-making, leery of challenging Netanyahu, the leader of Israel’s right-wing governing coalition, even as they castigate Biden for supposed weakness. Netanyahu agreed not only to enter a temporary truce to facilitate the release of hostages but also to release three Palestinians held in Israeli prisons for various crimes for every one hostage freed under the deal brokered by Biden.

“What I’m grateful for is that these hostages have been returned to their families,” former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican presidential candidate, said on “State of the Union” on CNN over the weekend. “That’s extraordinarily important and humane to have that done. So I think President Biden deserves credit for that.”

“Where I think he’s starting to err,” Christie added, is “to say he hopes that this continues, that the truce continues. He can’t be doing that kind of stuff, in my view, publicly.”

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., took a harsher position on “Fox News Sunday.” While he said he did not “want to second-guess the Israeli government,” he was happy to second-guess Biden, accusing him of not supporting Israel enough.

“I have to say it seems like President Biden puts more pressure on Israel than he does on Hamas and its hosts in Qatar,” Cotton said. “The Biden administration has consistently behind the scenes insisted that Israel’s government take steps that are clearly not in Israel’s interest,” he added, citing the delivery of fuel to Gaza, which he said would aid Hamas, not just civilians.

Still, the pause in fighting has eased some of the criticism Biden has taken from the left wing of his party, which has assailed him for, in its view, supporting Israel too much. Israel’s military campaign has killed thousands of civilians in Gaza even as it has focused on destroying Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union.

The release of Avigail gave Biden a small but emotionally powerful victory amid all the tumult in the region. Taken hostage after her parents were gunned down in front of her, Avigail spent seven weeks in captivity and turned 4 on Friday in the hands of Hamas. Her case generated waves of international concern and condemnation.

“She’s been through a terrible trauma,” Biden said. “What she endured is unthinkable.”

But he reveled in her release. “Thank God she’s home,” he said. “I wish I was there to hold her.”

1142923415,20231128,"President Katalin Novák discussed illegal migration, the importance of peace and economic issues, among other topics, with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Cairo on Monday.

The two heads of state reviewed their diplomatic activities and agreements of recent years and discussed topical issues pertaining to the future, Tamás Schanda, the Sándor Palace‘s cabinet chief, told public media.

Concerning illegal migration, Egypt was a key player in the region, adding that Hungary and the whole of the European Union counted on the north African country to keep illegal migration at bay.

Novák and el-Sisi, who talked behind closed doors for over an hour and a half, also touched on the situation in the war zones in their countries’ neighbourhoods. They were in agreement that both of their countries had a vested interest in stability and peace in their regions.

As regards economic ties, Hungarian businesses were present in the Egyptian market and Hungary had fulfilled an “unprecedented” order of rolling stock by Egypt.

Egypt was a strategic partner of Hungary, calling it a key player in the region with a decisive say in attempting to implement solutions in crisis zones. Hungary and Egypt were also each other’s natural allies and were bound by their strategic thinking as well as the joint projects and achievements of recent years, he added.

Both presidents and countries considered traditional values like family important, the cabinet chief said, adding that Novák and el-Sisi had also discussed the Stipendium Peregrinum scholarship scheme for Hungarian students who have applied to the world’s best universities.

According to a statement on the Egyptian presidency’s website, Novák expressed appreciation for Egypt’s role in safeguarding stability and peace in the Middle East.

Concerning the Russia-Ukraine war, Novák and Sisi were in agreement on the importance of robust international action to resolve the crisis.

Regarding developments in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, President el-Sisi underlined the importance of reaching a lasting ceasefire and ensuring humanitarian assistance, adding that the conflict must not spill over into the West Bank. The region’s stability and security was closely linked to the international recognition of the Palestinian state, along the borders of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as the capital, he said.

During her official visit to Egypt, Novák also held talks with Speaker of the Egyptian House of Representatives Hanafy Gebaly.

On Tuesday, she will meet Pope Tawadros II, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, and on Friday she will address the United Nations COP28 climate summit.

Now the British billionaire is participating in the first flight of a commercial aircraft across the Atlantic powered entirely by sustainable aviation fuel, beating arch-rival British Airways to the punch.

Virgin Atlantic flight VS100 took off from London Heathrow to New York on Tuesday morning. Besides Branson and Virgin Atlantic Chief Executive Officer Shai Weiss, UK Transport Secretary Mark Harper will be on board the Boeing Co. 787, lending a political dimension to the exercise that seeks to show how the aviation world is cruising toward a cleaner future.

But even Branson’s bravado and infectious optimism can’t mask that fact that the road toward net zero, a goal the industry aims to achieve by 2050, is becoming ever hard to navigate. SAF, as sustainable aviation fuel is called, isn’t available in large enough quantities to make a real impact.

And airlines worry that the higher cost of the fuel will leave passengers footing the bill, just as they return to flying after years of pandemic malaise.

SAF fuels are made from sources including waste oils and non-food crops and are widely seen as the only realistic short-term mechanism for the aviation industry to meet its sustainability goals.

With those feedstocks in short supply, scaling up will require fuels derived from electricity. The vast amounts of renewable energy needed are a stretch — leading to questions about SAF’s environmental credentials.

Deutsche Lufthansa AG CEO Carsten Spohr estimated in September that his airline alone would consume half of Germany’s entire electricity production to switch its fleet to green fuels like e-kerosene, underscoring the challenge in reducing emissions from air transport.

For now, large passenger aircraft can’t switch to battery power because they lack the energy density for the foreseeable future to lift a commercial planeload of passengers and cargo into the sky. That leaves only alternative fuels as a viable option.

The Virgin Atlantic flight comes just a few days before the COP 28 climate summit kicks off in Dubai, which is also home to Emirates. The world’s largest international airline flew its own SAF flight last week, operating an Airbus A380 on a demonstration flight with one of its four engines powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel.

Harper, speaking to reporters ahead of the flight taking off, said the government sets the mandate while industry needs to “work out how to deliver it, negotiate the contracts and do the pricing.”

At the Dubai Air Show this month, Emirates President Tim Clark described the challenge of getting to even 10% of SAF fuel by 2030 as a “herculean” task. Still, he said, the industry would look for as much of the fuel as it could get as it will take a long time to decarbonize aviation through other means.

The European Union has adopted mandates that will require airlines to use 6% SAF by 2030, rising to 34% by 2040 and 70% halfway through the century. Hurdles to getting there include the lack of availability and pricing, which currently sees airlines face fuel bills that are three to five times higher when they use the sustainable alternative.

“It’s taken radical collaboration to get here and we’re proud to have reached this important milestone, but we need to push further,” Virgin Atlantic CEO Weiss said in a statement. “There’s simply not enough SAF and it’s clear that in order to reach production at scale, we need to see significantly more investment.”

The US has subsidized production of SAF with deep tax breaks. The UK has a target to have five SAF plants under construction by 2025, which Harper, the UK transport secretary, insisted at an industry event last week was “on track.” He said recent world events have shown the danger of over—reliance on energy imports as he pledged to build Britain’s SAF base.

British Airways owner IAG SA currently uses 1% SAF on its flights and said it would like to see more UK production and more incentives to drive the growth of the industry.

“You need pretty deep pockets to do what the US is doing and the rest of the world isn’t going to be able to do that, but our overriding message to governments is that a mandate on its own won’t drive investment,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s group head of sustainability. “You need policy incentives.”"
1142953669,20231128,"A senior Volkswagen executive involved in a global cost-cutting strategy said on Friday, 24 November, he was ""very worried"" about the future of the company's operations in South Africa, which is fighting persistent power cuts and logistics snarls.

The company's VW passenger car brand is in the midst of defining the key measures of a global scheme to boost its flagging margin - the first of a series of savings drives aimed at improving group profitability and staying competitive in the transition to electric cars.

The German automaker has been in South Africa for nearly 80 years. Factors like competitive labour costs once placed it among the company's higher-ranking bases globally, VW brand chief Thomas Schaefer said during a visit to the country.

But the costs of mitigating power outages caused by chronic production shortfalls at state-owned utility Eskom as well as rising labour costs and logjams on railways and at ports have eroded that advantage, he said.

""Eventually you have to say, why are we building cars in a less competitive factory somewhere far away from the real market where the consumption is?"" Schaefer said. ""I'm very worried about it ... We're not in the business of charity.""

He said the company's team in South Africa had done what it could to overcome what he called an ""uphill battle"" but that ultimately the South African government needed to step up to solve the problems.

Volkswagen produced some 132,200 Polo and Vivo models at its South African facility in Uitenhage last year, most of them for export.

Those export markets now risk disappearing, however, as wealthy countries move to electric vehicles (EVs).

The European Union and Britain are planning to ban sales of new internal combustion vehicles from 2035.

Schaefer said there were no current plans to introduce EV manufacturing in South Africa, since electric cars are currently priced out of the reach of most domestic consumers. Producing them for export would not be environmentally sustainable, he said.

With the proper government policies aimed at leveraging the country's proximity to critical minerals like lithium and cobalt, however, it could become a battery manufacturing hub, he said.

""There's a realistic chance that South Africa, with enough focus, with all the raw materials in the neighbourhood, they could be a champion,"" Schaefer said."
1142950752,20231128,"November 27, 2023 (KHARTOUM) – The European Union (EU) has cautioned all third parties, notably nations in the region, to refrain from directly or indirectly fueling the conflict in Sudan.

The warning is contained in the EU’s High Representative’s statement on the situation in Sudan.

“Any external support being provided to one or the other of the warring parties will not contribute to the resolution of the conflict and to the stability of the region,” it reads in part.

The EU and its member states further reiterated their strong condemnation of the continuous fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and their respective affiliated militias, saying the conflict fundamentally threatens the safety and security of the people of Sudan as well as the unity and stability of the country and the region.

“As long as the warring parties continue to fight, the whole of Sudan faces further division and fragmentation, putting at stake its territorial integrity and national sovereignty,” it explained.

It urged all parties to silence their guns and end hostilities immediately without pre-conditions.

Within Sudan, 4.5 million people have reportedly been internally displaced since mid-April while a further 1.2 million, mostly women and girls, fled to neighbouring countries, including Chad.

The EU expressed concerns over the escalation of violence and the irreparable cost to human life in Darfur and throughout the country, as well as violations of International Human Rights Law and International Humanitarian Law.

Under International Humanitarian Law, according to the statement extended to Sudan Tribune Tuesday, the warring parties have responsibility to protect civilians, including women and girls.

“The EU is appalled by the numerous reports of sexual and gender-based violence, including abductions and detention in slave-like conditions, as well as serious violations and abuses of human rights including children’s rights,” stressed the statement.

The EU said it is concerned by reports on mass violence against civilians and ethnic cleansing.

It called on all actors to halt attacks on civilian infrastructure, including schools, healthcare facilities and humanitarian warehouses and other objects used for humanitarian relief operations.

Reiterating the importance of accountability for perpetrators of crimes, the EU stressed the need for the adoption of restrictive measures designed to discourage individuals and entities from engaging in activities that threaten the peace, security or stability of Sudan, and from obstructing the swift resumption of the democratic political transition in the country.

Nearly 25 million people in Sudan need humanitarian assistance, aid agencies say."

1142958902,20231128,"Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protestors, calling for a permanent ceasefire amid the Israel-Hamas war, blocked the Manhattan bridge on Sunday in New York City.

The demonstration caused heavy traffic in both directions between Manhattan and Brooklyn.

The New York Police Department reported hundreds of protestors, including the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice For Peace (JVP), blocking the Manhattan bridge. The police arrested several people, but the NYPD spokesperson said the confirmed number of people arrested was not immediately available.

Since the October 7 attack, the demonstration on Manhattan bridge was followed by a series of orchestrated pro-ceasefire disruptions, including sit-ins at Grand Central station that also resulted in traffic and commuter disruption.

The report said loud horns and screams were heard during the demonstration as cars loaded onto the bridge. ""I support their protest, but I don't think it's a good idea to close the bridge,"" a man on the bridge told Fox News.

The protestors chanted, ""Let Gaza live,"" and other messages that called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. JVP spokesperson Jay Saper said the US government could not ignore the polling and the demonstrations as most Americans called for a permanent ceasefire.

He added that they knew that business-as-usual could not continue while the US government was continuously funding and fueling genocidal attacks against the Palestinians of Gaza.

""We know that taking mass action is necessary to help build international outcry that can stop the bombings permanently,"" he said.

The mass protests made it impossible for politicians to continue to support the actions of Israel unless they were willing to withstand escalating pressure. Saper assured that they would continue to speak out until all Palestinians were free.

On Monday, Saper announced the two-day extension of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The militants freed 11 more hostages, who were handed over directly to Israel, while others left through Egypt.

The series of mass protests in US cities and Western capitals made it possible and effective to continue the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Egypt sent two delegations to monitor the ceasefire in Tel Aviv and Gaza. But they were also looking for ways to maintain the pause permanently.

President Biden said that the ceasefire brought genuine opportunity for progress. The European Union also said in the statement that they commend Egypt, the UN, the US, and others who played a role in facilitating the temporary ceasefire.

China also supported Israel and Hamas to continue the ceasefire. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said both sides must find a durable solution to the conflict.

1142961129,20231127,"Arab states and the European Union agreed at a meeting in Spain yesterday that a two-state solution was the answer to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, with EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell saying the Palestinian Authority should rule Gaza.

Borrell said all EU members attending the meeting of Mediterranean nations in Barcelona and almost all attendees overall had agreed on the need for a two-state solution.

The Palestinian Authority must hold elections and improve its functioning but is the only ‘viable solution’ to the future leadership of Gaza, currently run by Hamas, to avoid a ‘power vacuum’, he said.

A current four-day truce is the first halt in fighting in the seven weeks since Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages back into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

In response to that attack, Israel bombarded the enclave and mounted a ground offensive in the north. More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced.

Hamas said it wanted to extend the truce. An Israeli official told Reuters the onus was on Hamas to produce a new list of 10 hostages it could free today in exchange for that becoming an additional truce day.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the Palestinian people should decide who rules them, and that any talk of administration of Gaza after the conflict should focus on the West Bank and Gaza as one entity.

A two-state solution envisages a state for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al Maliki said the Palestinian Authority, which lost control of the Gaza Strip in a 2007 power struggle with Hamas, had no need to return to Gaza, adding: “We have been there all the time, we have 60,000 public workers there.”

The three were speaking at the conclusion of a short meeting of the Forum for the Union of the Mediterranean in Barcelona, a 43-member grouping of European, North African and Middle Eastern countries.

Israel did not attend the summit. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal Bin Farhan spoke as a representative of a group of ministers from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation.

Far-right Dutch leader Geert Wilders tried to jump-start his bid to form a governing coalition Tuesday, appointing a new ""scout"" to lead the process just a day after his handpicked choice quit over fraud allegations.

Wilders, whose stunning general election win on Wednesday sent shockwaves through the Netherlands and the whole of Europe, faces an uphill battle to persuade others to join him in government.

And the already difficult process collapsed in chaos when his first choice, Gom Van Strien, was forced to step down on Monday following reports of fraud at a previous company. ""Not my dream start,"" admitted Wilders.

The new ""scout"" is former Labour Party education minister Ronald Plasterk. His job is to shuttle between party leaders and work out who is prepared to work with whom.

Plasterk, 66, who has also served as interior minister, as well as university lecturer, columnist and cancer researcher, won ""broad support"" from top party leaders, according to Lower House chairwoman Vera Bergkamp.

""It is important that after a false start, we get the conversation back on track,"" Bergkamp told reporters.

Wilders described Plasterk as a ""creative mind with great political experience, but also distance"" from politics.

""I thought it was a good idea to choose someone from another party... he himself agreed with that,"" added the 60-year-old firebrand.

In his first news conference as scout, Plasterk said reporters might be surprised to see him standing before them -- ""but no one is more surprised than me.""

""The outcome of the election is also surprising for many but the country needs to be governed,"" added Plasterk.

He said he would get down to work immediately, meeting the party leaders with the aim of reporting back to parliament early next month.

Despite repeatedly stressing he has moderated his more extreme views on Islam and immigrants, Wilders still faces an uphill battle to convince others to serve under his PVV Freedom Party.

The PVV manifesto calls for a ban on Korans, mosques and headscarves, plus a referendum on leaving the European Union and halting weapons supplies to Ukraine.

His preferred coalition is with the pro-reform NSC party of Pieter Omtzigt (20 seats), the BBB farmers party (seven seats), and the centre-right VVD party (24 seats).

Wilders won an unexpected 37 seats and needs 76 MPs in the 150-seat parliament to form a workable majority.

Omtzigt has declared a willingness to talk, the BBB party seems a shoo-in to join forces but the VVD, the current ruling party, has ruled out serving in a Wilders-led cabinet.

VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz, who was born in Turkey and came to the Netherlands as an eight-year-old following her asylum-seeker father, has said she would ""support"" a centre-right cabinet.

But with the loss of 10 seats compared to the previous election, Yesilgoz has said the voters do not seem to want the VVD in the coalition, drawing fire from Wilders and even some in her own party.

""The voter has sent a very clear signal: we cannot keep going as we were. We will live up to our responsibilities, but in a different place,"" Yesilgoz told reporters.

Wilders has accused Yesilgoz of playing ""little political games"" and said that if everyone shows willingness to compromise, the talks could be wrapped up ""in a couple of weeks"".

European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Iliana Ivanova, said in an interview for BTA that the European Union is one of the leading sources of funding for research featured in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), thanks to the Horizon Europe programme. Ivanova added that the IPCC is among the most reputable sources of knowledge on climate change.

EU research and innovation programmes have contributed to more than 4,500 publications cited by the IPCC, Ivanova noted. The EU ranks second among the funders most frequently acknowledged in the evidence supporting IPCC reports. ""In terms of numbers: 35% of the more than EUR 95 billion Horizon Europe budget (2012-2027) is earmarked for climate action. Over EUR 1 billion of this will be invested in the development of climate research,"" she said.

Bulgaria's Hydrogen Valley is among the 9 EU-wide projects selected for funding by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership. Located near Stara Zagora, Southern Bulgaria, it aims to produce at least 500 tonnes of hydrogen a year. The EU is funding it with a grant of EUR 8 million. The project coincides with the research and innovation approach as outlined in the EU's hydrogen strategy, REPowerEU and the upcoming Hydrogen Valley Roadmap.

Ivanova pointed out that Bulgaria is participating in an ongoing research project on small modular reactors, which is co-funded by a EUR 2.9 million programme of the European Atomic Energy Community. The project involves the Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the Technical University of Sofia."

This means that specifically identifiable physical items of the Metal are allocated to the Issuer and are segregated from metal held for other clients of the custodian. However, for operational purposes, small amounts of Metal may be held on an ""unallocated"" basis. This means that the Secured Account Custodian maintains an account in the name of the Issuer which shows them as being entitled to delivery of a particular amount of the Metal but without specific physical metal having been identified. Where Metal is held on an ""unallocated"" basis the right to delivery is a purely contractual right and, as such, the Issuer is an unsecured creditor of the custodian and is exposed to the credit risk of the custodian. The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and any underlying Metal. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as ""Secured Property"" for this Series. Securityholders will not, by reason of holding such Series, have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities. The security will become enforceable if payment of the redemption amount in respect of such ETC Securities is not made when due on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the Scheduled Early Redemption Date (defined below) (if applicable). On the Scheduled Maturity Date, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Final Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Final Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount (defined below) and (ii) 10 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security as at the series issue date (the ""Minimum Debt Principal Amount"") plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Final Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Final Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the volume-weighted average prices per metal unit at which the Metal Agent (defined below) is able to sell the underlying Metal (""Average Metal Sale Price"") during the Final Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Final Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Final Redemption Valuation Date. ""Final Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date specified in the Final Terms or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. ""Specified Interest Amount"" is the amount of interest per ETC Security equal to that ETC Security's pro rata share of the amount of interest which has accrued (if any) on the proceeds of realisation of the underlying Metal deposited into the Series Cash Account (defined below) during or relating to the relevant redemption disposal period. Whilst interest may accrue at a positive, zero or negative rate on the Series Cash Account, the Specified Interest Amount is subject to a minimum of zero and any negative interest shall instead be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the underlying Metal. If any of the early redemption events occur, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Early Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Early Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount and (ii) the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Early Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Early Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the Average Metal Sale Price during the Early Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Early Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Early Redemption Valuation Date. The ""Scheduled Early Redemption Date"" is the 8th business day following the Early Redemption Disposal Period. The ""Early Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date of the occurrence of an early redemption event or the date on which the Trustee gives notice that, due to the occurrence of an event of default, the ETC Securities shall become due and payable at their Early Redemption Amount on the Scheduled Early Redemption Date, or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. There can be no assurance that the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, will be greater than or equal to the amount invested by any securityholder. If the Final Metal Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, plus the Specified Interest Amount falls below the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount, then due to the limited recourse nature of the ETC Securities, securityholders are unlikely to receive payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, in full and may receive zero. The Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount per ETC Security, as applicable, will be determined by reference to the Average Metal Sale Price of the underlying Metal held in respect of the ETC Securities sold during the Final Redemption Disposal Period or Early Redemption Disposal Period, as applicable, by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (or any successor or replacement) as ""Metal Agent"", net of associated deductions and taxes. The Issuer will, on or prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date or Scheduled Early Redemption Date, publish the determination of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, (which shall include publication of the price, volume and date of each sale of underlying Metal during the relevant redemption disposal period, including information on any fees, deductions and/or taxes imposed on such sale, and the determination of the Average Metal Sale Price) on the website maintained on behalf of the Issuer at www.etf.dws.com (or such other website notified by the Issuer for the ETC Securities from time to time). The Metal Agent will pay the aggregate proceeds of such disposals (converted, if necessary, into the currency of the ETC Securities) to the cash account for the Series (the ""Series Cash Account"") maintained by J.P. Morgan SE as ""Account Bank"" as directed by the Programme Administrator (defined below). The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest. On early or final redemption of the ETC Securities, a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security, as the case may be. The ETC Securities are subject to a product fee that accrues on a daily basis. Accrued product fee is paid by a daily reduction in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security which, as a result of such reduction, operates as a charge on securityholders. The Issuer will, using the Metal Agent, periodically realise Metal equal to such charge and the proceeds will be credited to the Series Cash Account maintained by the Account Bank in relation to the ETC Securities and used by the Issuer to pay the product fee to the Programme Administrator in accordance with the Programme Administrator Agreement. Such realisation will happen on a periodic (typically weekly) basis. The Programme Administrator Agreement provides that the Programme Administrator will use the product fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities to pay on behalf of the Issuer the costs of the Programme (as set out in the schedule to the Programme Administrator Agreement) relating to such Series of ETC Securities and the Issuer more generally. The ETC Securities may become due and payable prior to their Scheduled Maturity Date in connection with the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) certain legal or regulatory changes occur in relation to the Issuer and the Issuer gives a notice of redemption; (ii) any agent in relation to the ETC Securities resigns or their appointment is terminated and the Issuer gives notice that no successor or replacement has been appointed within a 60 calendar day period; (iii) the Value per ETC Security is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price as at the series issue date for two consecutive valuation days and the determination agent gives the relevant notice; (iv) the Issuer will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, be required to make a payment in respect of VAT or be required to account for VAT in respect of a delivery of Metal from or to an authorised participant (whether or not such VAT is recoverable); (v) an Issuer Call Redemption Event occurs (as discussed further below under ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""); (vi) the Issuer becomes entitled to serve a VAT redemption event notice and the Trustee gives the relevant notice as directed by the requisite number of securityholders; or (vii) an event of default occurs under the ETC Securities. These include certain breaches by the Issuer of its obligations that are not cured within the applicable cure period and certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer. The Issuer may elect to redeem the ETC Securities early on giving not less than 30 calendar days' notice to securityholders (an ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""). The ETC Securities will rank equally amongst themselves. The rights of securityholders are limited in recourse to the Secured Property. As such, once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed, none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors, officers, members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and, therefore, the rights of securityholders will rank in accordance therewith. As a result of such provisions, the securityholders may not receive in full the final redemption amount or early redemption amount payable in respect of an ETC Security. All payments in respect of the ETC Securities shall be made net of and after allowance for any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes. In the event that any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes applies to payments in respect of the ETC Securities, securityholders will be subject to such tax or deduction and shall not be entitled to receive amounts to compensate for any such tax or deduction. No event of default will occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction. The ETC Securities will be governed by the laws of Ireland. There will be two security deeds relating to the ETC Securities; one will be governed by the laws of Ireland and the other will be governed by English law.

The ETC Securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") or under the securities law of any state or political sub-division of the United States of America or any of its territories, possessions or other areas subject to its jurisdiction including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Issuer has not been and will not be registered under any federal laws of the United States of America. The ETC Securities include ETC Securities in bearer form that are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. No person has registered nor will register as a commodity pool operator of the Issuer under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the ""CEA"") and the rules thereunder (the ""CFTC Rules"") of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the ""CFTC""). Any offer or sale of the ETC Securities must be made in an offshore transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Regulation S thereunder (""Regulation S""). The ETC Securities may not at any time be offered, sold or otherwise transferred in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, persons who are either (a) U.S. persons as defined in Regulation S or (b) persons who do not come within the definition of a non-United States person under CFTC Rule 4.7 (excluding for the purposes of subsection (d) thereof, the exception to the extent it would apply to persons who are not non-United States persons).

· The amount payable in respect of the ETC Securities is linked to the performance of the underlying Metal. Prices of precious metals are generally more volatile than prices in other asset classes. If the value of such underlying Metal falls that will reduce amounts payable in respect of the ETC Securities. · The Value per ETC Security, secondary market price and the redemption amount of ETC Securities will primarily be affected by the performance and level of the underlying Metal, rate movements, market perception, the creditworthiness of the Metal Agent, the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian and any applicable sub-custodian and liquidity in the ETC Securities. · The securityholders and other transaction parties will have recourse only to the Secured Property in respect of the ETC Securities and not to any other assets of the Issuer. If, following realisation in full of the Secured Property relating to the ETC Securities, any outstanding claim remains unpaid, then such claim will be extinguished and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect thereof. · The Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is subject to the deduction of the product fee. · The Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount (if any) operates as a minimum repayment amount on the early or final redemption of the ETC Securities. However, in the event that the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is insufficient to fund the Minimum Debt Principal Amount payable in respect of each ETC Security to all securityholders on such early or final redemption, such securityholders may not receive payment of the Minimum Debt Principal Amount in full and may receive substantially less. · The Issuer and securityholders are exposed to the credit risk of the Metal Agent, the Programme Administrator (defined below), the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian, the Account Bank, and any sub-custodian and the authorised participants. · Any disruption to a price source or relevant association may affect the Value per ETC Security and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security. · Certain events may lead to an early redemption of the ETC Securities. · ETC Securities may have a long term and the only means through which an investor can realise value from an ETC Security prior to its Scheduled Maturity Date is to sell it at its then market price in a secondary market transaction. While each authorised participant may make a market for the ETC Securities, no authorised participant is obliged to make a market for any series of ETC Securities and an authorised participant may discontinue making a market at any time. Furthermore, any market in ETC Securities may not be liquid and the secondary market price (if any) for ETC Securities may be substantially less than the price paid by the investor. · With respect to any redemption disposal period, if the proceeds from the realisation of the underlying Metal would cause the balance standing to the Series Cash Account to exceed the maximum amount that can be held during the period between December and January of each calendar year (such amount and such period to be agreed from time to time between the Issuer, the Programme Administrator and the Account Bank (the ""Year-End Period"")), then the Programme Administrator may postpone the redemption date until after the Year-End Period, during which time the Metal Agent will not deposit such proceeds into the Series Cash Account and interest equal to the Specified Interest Amount will not accrue on such proceeds for so long as they are not deposited into the Series Cash Account.

However, in connection with ongoing or future restructuring and/or reorganisations within the DWS group, it is possible that some of the roles currently performed by DWS International GmbH may be novated, delegated or otherwise transferred to a different entity within the DWS group without the prior written consent of securityholders or the Trustee, provided that it is legally permitted to make such novation, delegation or transfer. DWS International GmbH acting through any of its branches or affiliates may also be an Authorised Participant in relation to a series of ETC Securities. DWS International GmbH has been, or may be, appointed to act as a distributing entity in respect of the ETC Securities. DWS International GmbH, the Programme Administrator, has certain discretions to adjust the levels of the Base Fee Percentage and the FX Hedging Fee Percentage (and, therefore, the Product Fee Percentage and the Product Fee) in relation to each Series of ETC Securities. The remuneration of the Programme Administrator is included in the Product Fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities and depends on the amount of the Product Fees and their sufficiency to cover the costs of the Programme. A DWS entity and/or its affiliates may engage in trading and market-making activities and may hold long or short positions in any metal, other instruments or derivative products based on or related to the metal, metal for their proprietary accounts or for other accounts under their management. DWS entities may also issue securities or enter into financial instruments in relation to any Metal. To the extent that any DWS entity, directly or through its affiliates, serves as issuer, agent, manager, sponsor or underwriter of such securities or other instruments, its interests with respect to such products may be adverse to those of the securityholders. Such activities may have an adverse effect on the Value per ETC Security and/or the value of the underlying Metal relating to the ETC Securities."

Australia has become the latest country to target vaping, announcing it will implement a ban on imports of disposable single-use vapes from January 1, health minister Mark Butler said.

""We’re taking the next steps to stamp out vaping. We’re committed to protecting Australians, particularly young people, from the harms of vaping and nicotine dependence,"" Butler wrote in a social media post on Tuesday.

He said all health ministers agreed to implement a concerted response to vaping.

Australia has low smoking rates, with just one in ten adults considered daily smokers. Yet the government said there was a ""marked increase"" in the prevalence of vaping.

There are more ""current vapers than current smokers among those aged under 35 years"", a government report said.

Around 14.5 per cent of adolescents aged 14 to 17 years old were vaping, the report added.

Australia has one of the highest taxes on cigarettes in the world, with packs at nearly €30 each.

New Zealand has also been at the forefront of cracking down on tobacco, passing legislation last year that included a smoking ban for the next generation. The country's new government has said however that they will repeal the smoking ban.

The UK government recently announced plans to tackle vaping as well, with a consultation planned to look at restrictions on flavours, regulating sale displays and packaging as well as restricting the sale of disposable vapes.

Around 11.6 per cent of UK children aged 11 to 17 tried an e-cigarette once or twice in 2023, according to an Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) report.

The European Union has so far banned flavoured heated tobacco products, which are not the same as e-cigarettes."

1143002679,20231128,"The European Space Agency (ESA) declared success after an Ariane 6 rocket fired its core-stage engine in French Guiana for seven minutes on Thursday, clearing one of a handful of remaining hurdles before the new launcher can lift off on its first test flight.

The Ariane 6's inaugural launch, now scheduled for next year, has been delayed repeatedly since ESA approved the new rocket for development in 2014. The test-firing of the Ariane 6 main engine on a launch pad at the Guiana Space Center in South America last week was the most significant test not yet accomplished on the rocket's preflight checklist.

The test lasted 426 seconds—a little more than seven minutes—while a full-size test model of the Ariane 6 rocket remained on its launch pad. In order for the rocket to actually take off, it would need to light its four strap-on solid-fueled boosters. That was not part of the plan for Thursday's test.

After loading super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants into the Ariane 6 rocket, the launch team in French Guiana gave a ""go"" for ignition of the rocket's Vulcain 2.1 main engine. The engine lit at 3:44 pm EST (20:44 UTC) and throttled up to full power, producing more than 200,000 pounds of thrust.

Thursday's test was nearly a minute shy of the 470-second duration that ESA publicized ahead of time, but officials were satisfied with the result. Several times during the test, the nozzle of the Vulcain 2.1 engine swiveled to exercise the rocket's thrust vector control steering system.

“Ariane 6 now has a core stage and an upper stage which have undergone all testing necessary to be ready for the inaugural flight,"" said Martin Sion, CEO of ArianeGroup, the joint venture between Airbus and Safran that is responsible for developing the Ariane 6 rocket.

Josef Aschbacher, ESA's director general, said in a statement that engineers ""have now run through every step of the rocket's flight without it leaving Earth... We are back on track towards re-securing Europe’s autonomous access to space.""

A long road to get here

The Ariane 6 rocket was originally supposed to launch for the first time in 2020, but it's now running four years late. The rocket it will replace, the Ariane 5, made its final flight in July, leaving Europe without a rocket to launch its own space missions. That has prompted ESA and the European Union to look abroad to get spacecraft into orbit. SpaceX, a rival of the European launch service provider Arianespace, has won contracts to launch several ESA missions due to the Ariane 6 delays.

Engineers designed the Ariane 6 as an expendable rocket, with no near-term roadmap to introduce reusable technology into the vehicle. And officials from ESA, which funded the lion's share of the rocket's development, have acknowledged the Ariane 6 will cost more per launch than originally expected.

So there are concerns about the Ariane 6's competitiveness with SpaceX on the commercial launch market. Earlier this month, ESA's member states agreed to change the way the agency develops new rockets. Rather than continuing to follow the top-down, government-managed approach ESA has used to develop European rockets over the last five decades, the agency plans to shift to a more commercial model to make European companies developing new rockets eligible to compete for ESA launch contracts.

In advance of the long-duration engine test last week, the Ariane 6 launch team in French Guiana completed a four-second test firing of the Ariane 6 main engine in September. Last month, teams completed a complex 36-hour countdown rehearsal test that involved the loading and unloading of cryogenic propellants from the rocket's tanks.

Engineers finished qualification testing of the Ariane 6's Vinci upper-stage engine earlier this year on a test stand in Germany. One more test of the Vinci engine is planned for December at the German facility, which will involve checks of the engine's response to simulated in-flight anomalies. That test doesn't need to be completed before the Ariane 6's first test flight, officials said.

The hydrogen-fueled Vinci engine on the Ariane 6's upper stage is one of the rocket's major new elements. It is designed to restart in space, replacing the Ariane 5's upper-stage engine that was only capable of a single burn on each mission.

In the coming weeks, ground crews in French Guiana will lower the Ariane 6 rocket used during this year's tests off its launch pad and roll it back to a nearby hangar. The core stage and upper stage assigned to the first Ariane 6 launch will ship to French Guiana from factories in France and Germany for final flight preparations.

""On this final stretch towards the first flight, we still have to carry out a few additional tests to demonstrate fault tolerance, deliver the first launcher to Kourou, and perform the launch system qualification review,” Sion said.

Later this week, officials from ESA and ArianeGroup plan to brief the media on the full results from the Ariane 6 test campaign and announce a schedule for the rocket's first flight."

1143007183,20231128,"The Sudanese army and paramilitaries exchanged shells on Monday from opposite banks of the Nile in the capital, Khartoum residents reported, in the seventh month of a war whose atrocities have been denounced by NGOs.

""The army, from Omdourman on the west bank, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) from Khartoum-North on the east bank"", exchanged artillery fire and rockets, a witness told AFP.

This account is corroborated by other residents, including local activists, who claim that dozens of civilians have been killed in the bombardments in recent weeks.

The conflict that broke out on 15 April between the head of the army, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhane, and his deputy-turned-rival, General Mohamed Hamdane Daglo, has claimed more than 10,000 lives, according to an estimate by the NGO Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (Acled), which is widely considered to be an underestimate.

It has also displaced more than six million people, according to the UN, and destroyed most of the country's infrastructure.

At the negotiating table, the two sides have little intention of making concessions, as demonstrated once again by the failure in early November of negotiations sponsored by the United States and Saudi Arabia.

On Monday, the RSF claimed to have ""attacked the Wadi Seidna base"", a strategic air base north of Khartoum, ""destroying a C130 military transport aircraft and an ammunition depot"".

More than 800 kilometres to the south-west, in al-Muglad, West Kordofan, the army withdrew from a base after an attack by paramilitaries in this oil-rich region, witnesses reported.

In the same state, in Babanusa, witnesses reported aerial bombardments by the army targeting paramilitaries. The army has retreated several times in recent weeks, while the RSF has taken control of military bases in the vast western region of Darfur.

The paramilitaries announced that they had taken ""total control"" of El Daein, the capital of East Darfur, marking the latest in a series of lightning advances by the RSF in Darfur, where only the capital of North Darfur, El Fasher, is still in the hands of the army.

Experts, aid workers and the United States have warned of an imminent attack on El Fasher, while human rights activists have reported massive ethnic massacres in the localities controlled by the RSF in Darfur, which has already been ravaged by decades of ethnic violence.

In a report published late on Sunday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on the UN Security Council to act to prevent further atrocities after the killing of hundreds of civilians in Darfur.

""Ethnic killings by the RSF in West Darfur have the hallmarks of an atrocity campaign against Massalit civilians"", a non-Arab ethnic minority targeted by the paramilitaries, said Mohamed Osman of HRW.

""The UN Security Council must stop ignoring the desperate need to protect civilians in Darfur"", he added.

In the town of Ardamata alone, at the beginning of November, more than 1,000 people were killed, according to the European Union, by armed groups who forced more than 8,000 people to flee to neighbouring Chad in one week, according to the UN.

HRW has verified satellite images that appear to confirm eyewitness accounts of newly dug mass graves where civilians buried their dead before fleeing.

The NGO also warned that the imminent closure of the UN mission in Sudan would ""significantly reduce UN monitoring of the situation"".

Sudan called this month for an end to the mandate of the UN mission, which has been operating mainly in the army-controlled east of the country since the start of the war."
1143013084,20231128,"An ECOWAS solidarity and fact-finding Mission has met in Freetown with President Julius Maada Bio over the apparent attempted military coup in Sierra Leone on Sunday while three of the four suspended member-States under military rule Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have announced the formation of a separate organisation.

The delegation, comprising the ECOWAS Commission’s President Omar Alieu Toure, Nigeria’s National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Christopher Musa and the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Gen. Emmanuel Udiandeye, had discussions at the State House on Monday with President Bio, accompanied by some officials of his government.

Diplomatic sources said the delegation delivered a goodwill message from the Chairman of the ECOWAS Authority and Nigerian President Bola Tinubu to President Bio and the government and people of Sierra Leone, over the attack by assailants on the Wilberforce Barracks near the Presidential Lodge.

President Bio and Sierra Leone’s Information and Civic Education Minister Hernor Bah said some the attackers had been arrested, while joint security forces were after the escapees.

No official casualty figures were given, but independent sources said there were “several deaths” from the exchange of gun fires, which lasted for several hours, while some prisoners were released from the country’s Central Pademba Prison in the state capital Freetown.

Sierra Leone’s immediate past President Ernest Bai Koroma also said in a statement that one of his official security guards was shot and killed, and another abducted by unknown gunmen.

The Bio government has now lifted the nationwide curfew imposed following the shootout, the second in the country within three months following the June controversial presidential elections.

In its initial statement on Sunday, ECOWAS had expressed deep concern and condemned the latest armed attacks.

President Bio was said to have expressed appreciation to ECOWAS and Nigeria for the solidarity visit, reiterating his commitment to democracy in Sierra Leone, which is still recovering from a devastating 11-year civil war that ended in 2002.

The Electoral Commission for Sierra Leone (ECSL) declared President Bio of the ruling Sierra Leone People’s Party (SLPP) re-elected with 56.17% vote in the June polls.

But the main opposition All People’s Congress (APC), whose candidate Samura Kamara was declared runner-up, rejected the ECSL results claiming that the vote was marred by irregularities.

Some civil society organisations as well as local and international election observation Missions also said the electoral process, especially the result management, lacked transparency.

The post-election disaffection has combined with socio-economic hardship to raise political tensions amid fears that Sierra Leone could relapse into conflict unless urgent remedial steps were taken.

Meanwhile, three suspended ECOWAS member States, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, have announced the formation of a mutual defence pact against “possible threats of armed rebellion or external aggression.”

The military rulers of the three countries initialled the accord for the Alliance of Sahel States, which binds the signatories to assist one another in the event of an attack on any one of them.

The troika in the joint statement fell short of announcing their dissociation from ECOWAS, which has imposed biting sanctions on them.

The regional economic bloc is struggling to restore constitutional order in the three countries and Guinea, where the military have seized power.

The ECOWAS Parliament has called for the sanctions on Niger to be lifted because of their severe impact on the country, especially the cut of electricity supply by Nigeria.

The Niger junta has meanwhile, announced the termination of a cooperation agreement between Niamey and the European Union aimed at curbing illegal migration from the country to Europe.

Analysts say these developments must be troubling to ECOWAS, which has so far, failed to carry through its threat of military intervention to restore constitutional order in Niger following the 26 July army coup in that country."

1143017915,20231128,"A Virgin Atlantic passenger jet flying from London to New York powered by 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) took off Tuesday morning, as the aviation world seeks to showcase the potential of low-carbon options to secure its future.

As the world decarbonizes, airlines are banking on fuel made from waste to reduce their emissions by up to 70 per cent, enabling them to keep operating before electric- and hydrogen-powered air travel becomes a reality in the decades to come.

The flight, involving a Virgin Boeing 787 powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, is the first time a commercial airline has flown long-haul on 100 per cent SAF.

It follows a successful transatlantic crossing by a Gulfstream G600 business jet using the same fuel last week.

Virgin Atlantic's billionaire founder Richard Branson, the airline's chief executive Shai Weiss and British transport minister Mark Harper are among the passengers on board.

The flight is scheduled to arrive at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 2:40 p.m. ET.

There will be no paying passengers or cargo on board what Virgin has dubbed Flight100, which comes days before the start of COP28 climate talks in Dubai on Thursday.

SAF is already used in jet engines as part of a blend with traditional kerosene, but after successful ground tests, Virgin and its partners Rolls-Royce, Boeing, BP and others won permission to fly using only SAF.

Aviation accounts for an estimated two to three per cent of global carbon emissions. SAF is key in reducing those emissions, but it is costly, at about three to five times as much as regular jet fuel right now, and accounts for less than 0.1 per cent of total global jet fuel in use today.

The fuel used to power Tuesday's flight is mostly made from used cooking oil and waste animal fat mixed with a small amount of synthetic aromatic kerosene made from waste corn, Virgin Atlantic said.

Many European airlines — including Virgin, IAG-owned British Airways and Air France — have said they want to be using 10 per cent SAF by 2030, and the industry's goal of ""net zero"" emissions by 2050 relies on that share rising to 65 per cent.

Rolls-Royce's CEO Tufan Erginbilgic said SAF was the only solution to decarbonize commercial flights in the medium term.

""I think on the big planes — I'm talking about commercial planes, if you like — really, the next 15-20 years' solution is genuinely SAF. We are making our engines compatible with SAF, so that transformation actually takes place,"" he said on Tuesday after announcing his strategy for Rolls-Royce.

Yet the 2030 target looks challenging given SAF's small volumes and its high cost.

In October, the head of IAG warned that there was a more than 90 per cent risk the industry would not meet the European Union mandate for SAF availability in 2025.

""[Fuel substitutes] are nowhere close to being scalable in the necessary time frame to avoid climate collapse. What is urgently needed is to reduce the burning of fossil jet fuels, which means reducing flights wherever possible,"" said Magdalena Heuwieser, who represents the network.

The aviation industry hopes that the Virgin Atlantic flight will highlight to governments the need for them to provide financial support to make SAF more readily available.

Virgin said the engines on the flight would be drained of SAF and tested before the plane returns to service using regular fuel."
1143017916,20231128,"The United States warns North Korea's actions could escalate the risk of military tensions and miscalculations on the Korean Peninsula.

South Korea's defense ministry said on Monday that North Korea has begun rebuilding guard posts and deploying firearms along the border as tensions rise following the North's recent spy satellite launch.

""Before destroying the [guard posts], there were observation posts, and they are presumed to be rebuilding them. It was made of white wood and painted with a camouflage pattern,"" a defense official told reporters.

""There are only a few guard posts currently undergoing restoration work, but the North is expected to restore all of them as they are essential facilities for surveillance,"" the official added.

South Korea's military would closely monitor North Korea's ""provocative acts"" while maintaining its ""full readiness"" to retaliate in the event of any provocations, the official noted. US Urges North Korea to Return to Diplomacy The United States has urged North Korea to immediately cease its ""provocative actions,"" saying that these actions could only escalate the risk of military tensions and miscalculations on the Korean Peninsula.

""The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its provocative actions and instead choose engagement,"" the official added.

The two Koreas previously dismantled or disarmed 11 of their guard posts inside their heavily fortified border, called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), under a 2018 deal meant to ease front-line military confrontations.

The accord required the two nations to halt aerial surveillance and live-fire exercises at no-fly and buffer zones established along the DMZ, as well as remove some of their guard posts and land mines. The deal left South Korea with 50 board guard posts and North Korea with 150.

However, the deal is now in danger of being scrapped as both countries openly threaten to breach it.

South Korea has suspended part of the accord that limits its reconnaissance and surveillance operations along the DMZ after North Korea defied warnings against launching a spy satellite into orbit.

The satellite also transmitted aerospace photos of the Norfolk Naval Station, Newport News Dockyard, and the Virginia airfield located in the United States, the report said.

""Four U.S. Navy nuclear carriers and one British aircraft carrier were spotted in the photos of the Norfolk Naval Station and the Newport News Dockyard,"" the news outlet stated.

This marked North Korea's third launch after two failed attempts on May 31 and Aug. 24.

Japan has strongly condemned the launch, calling it ""an extremely problematic act.""

""This is a serious issue affecting the safety of the people. Japan has lodged a strong protest against North Korea and condemned it in the strongest terms,"" Japan's defense ministry said.

They said the launch posed “a grave threat” to the region and violated the United Nations Security Council Resolutions prohibiting North Korea from launching any ballistic missile technology.

“North Korea cannot and will never have the status of a nuclear-weapon State under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,” the statement reads.

1143040453,20231128,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s fiscal turmoil is jeopardizing efforts to curb reliance on China as a supplier of high-tech components, according to UniCredit economist Andreas Rees.

The Constitutional Court limiting use of off-budget funds may hurt support for the semiconductor industry, Rees — who covers Germany — said Tuesday. The government had earmarked about €12 billion for such aid by 2027, he said.

“Substantially reducing Germany’s dependence on Chinese and Taiwanese high-tech goods would probably need even more, and not less, money,” he said in an emailed report. “Hence, the debt brake could not only become an obstacle to the hoped-for recovery in 2024 but could also endanger Germany’s longer-term strategic goals.”

Excessive reliance on China for parts is a key longer-term issue for German companies. Rees cited “tentative signs” of progress, with the share of high-tech imports from the nation declining recently as that of European Union countries rose.

“Nevertheless, substantial geopolitical risks still remain, especially in regard to the rising importance of Taiwan as supplier of semiconductors,” he said. “More efforts by companies and greater support from policymakers are likely to be needed in order to further ‘de-risk’ supply chains.”"

1143033336,20231128,"AMSTERDAM – One of the biggest mistakes I ever made as a journalist was to underestimate Geert Wilders, now the leader (and only formal member) of the most popular political party in the Netherlands, and potentially the first far-right prime minister his country has ever known.

I interviewed Wilders in 2005 for my book, Murder in Amsterdam, about the assassination of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a Muslim extremist. The Party for Freedom (PVV), founded by Wilders in 2006, did not exist yet. But I was interested in the views of an outspoken critic of Islam, and of immigrants with a Muslim background.

Frankly, I thought he was a bore, with no political future, and did not quote him in my book. Like most people, I was struck by his rather weird hairstyle. Why would a grown man and member of parliament wish to dye his fine head of dark hair platinum blond? In fact, he turned out to have been somewhat of a pioneer in this respect. The later successes of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson demonstrated the importance of visual branding, of having a zany image boosted by the cultivation of odd hair. (Perhaps Hitler’s toothbrush moustache, or even Napoleon’s comb-over, was a harbinger.)

There is, however, another possible interpretation of Wilders’ hair. In 2009, a Dutch anthropologist and expert on Indonesia, Lizzy van Leeuwen, argued that Wilders might have been keen to disguise his Eurasian roots. His maternal grandmother was partly Indonesian. His grandparents had to leave the Dutch East Indies under a cloud of financial malfeasance.

It would be unfair to hold any of this against Wilders, of course. Race may not explain anything. But there is a history of far-right, anti-Muslim sentiment among Eurasians in the former Dutch East Indies that might help to put his politics in context.

Eurasians, or Indos as they were called, were never fully accepted by the Indonesians or their Dutch colonial masters. They were born as outsiders. The more educated ones often yearned to become insiders. An aversion to Islam, the majority religion in the Dutch East Indies, and extreme Dutch nationalism were often the result.

During the 1930s, many members of the Dutch Nazi party in the colony had a Eurasian background. As van Leeuwen pointed out, the party enabled Indos to be “more Dutch than the Dutch.”

Wilders may not be a fascist, but his obsession with sovereignty, national belonging, and cultural and religious purity has a long lineage among outsiders. Ultra-nationalists often emerge from the periphery – Napoleon from Corsica, Stalin from Georgia, Hitler from Austria. Those who long to be insiders frequently become implacable enemies of people who are farther away from the center than they are.

Wilders is not a rarity, even in the Netherlands. In 1980, Henry Brookman founded the far-right Dutch Center Party to oppose immigration, especially Muslim immigration. Brookman, too, had a Eurasian background, as did another right-wing politician, Rita Verdonk, who founded the Proud of the Netherlands Party in 2007.

A politician who might fruitfully be compared to Wilders is former British Home Secretary Suella Braverman. As a child of immigrants – her parents are double outsiders, first as Indians in Africa and then as African-Indians in Britain – her animus toward immigrants and refugees “invading” the United Kingdom may seem puzzling. But in her case, too, a longing to belong may play a part in her politics.

Braverman’s entry into the British establishment and ascent within the Conservative Party shows that Britain has become more open to outsiders. It is less laudable that her hard-right views on immigration have become mainstream in Conservative politics, or that white-skinned Tories were happy to use an ambitious daughter of immigrants to promote an anti-immigrant agenda – at least until her incendiary rhetoric became too embarrassing.

Until relatively recently, ultra-nationalist parties and politicians were marginalized by mainstream conservative parties, or dropped, as happened in 1968 to Enoch Powell, the British politician who predicted that more non-white immigration would lead to “rivers of blood.” They were treated as political outsiders, whatever their family backgrounds.

To more and more disaffected voters, however, this was precisely their appeal. Brexiteers and Trump benefited from this in 2016, and Wilders is benefiting from it today.

But such outcomes could not happen without the cynicism displayed over the past few decades by traditional conservative parties. Afraid of losing their voters to the far right, they pandered to their prejudices, against foreign “freeloaders,” the Muslim threat to “Judeo-Christian values,” the “woke” city slickers, or the “people from nowhere.” But it was mostly just rhetoric, and conservative parties simply carried on serving the interests of rich people and big business. This only fed the rage of people who felt treated like outsiders and wanted an outsider to blow up the old order.

The way the conservative parties in the Netherlands, such as the Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), have dealt with this problem in the past was to refuse to govern with extremists like Wilders. The VVD also stood for internationalism, the European Union, military support of Ukraine, and measures to deal with climate change. Wilders is opposed to all of it.

What changed is that the VVD, hoping to protect its right flank, took a harder line on immigration and hinted that governing with angry outsiders might be possible after all (a stance that has now been reversed, but for how long?). Now that the door was left open, and immigration was made into an election issue, Wilders was able to win in a landslide.

The irony of this sorry tale is that Dilan Yeşilgöz, the VVD leader who allowed this to happen, was born in Ankara to a Turkish mother and Kurdish father. She is precisely the kind of Dutch citizen that Wilders has vowed to stamp out."

As LETA was told at the Foreign Ministry, Karins attended the 8th Regional Forum of the Union for Mediterranean (UfM) in Barcelona on Monday. The forum brought together foreign ministers from European Union member states and the Southern Mediterranean to discuss the current crisis in the Middle East and its possible solutions.

The event was co-chaired by the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Josep Borrell and Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia, attended the forum as a guest representing the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

In a bilateral meeting with the Saudi foreign minister, Karins discuss ways to strengthen cooperation between the EU and the Arab League to find a sustainable solution to the situation in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is a key player in the Middle East region and is also playing a particularly active role in efforts to resolve the current escalation. Karins thanked Saudi Arabia for its role in the Ukraine peace initiative.

The current security and humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank was discussed with Riyad al-Maliki, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Diaspora of the Palestinian Authority. The officials exchanged views on the support needed to overcome the crisis.

Karins also met with the EU Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process, Sven Koopmans, to discuss ways to strengthen the EU's involvement and role in resolving the crisis, including by considering long-term solutions based on the two-state solution."

Speaking at a press conference in Astana on Tuesday, O'Sullivan addressed concerns about the potential evasion of sanctions and the re-export of goods from Kazakhstan to Russia.

Despite ongoing challenges related to sanctions evasion, O'Sullivan reiterated the EU’s dedication to engaging in a constructive dialogue with Kazakh authorities. He emphasized that, while the EU is closely monitoring the activities of involved companies, there are currently no intentions to impose sanctions on these entities.

He went further to underscore the significance of the partnership between the EU and Kazakhstan, especially in areas such as green technologies and transportation.

Expressing hope for increased cooperation, O'Sullivan stressed the importance of avoiding sanctions becoming a hindrance to their bilateral relations.

O'Sullivan, a former Secretary-General of the Commission and a senior EU diplomat, last visited the region in April of the current year. The role of the EU Special Envoy has become crucial in the broader context of the EU’s strategy to prevent Russia from acquiring crucial technology and income for its actions in Ukraine.

The European Commission established the position of International Special Envoy for the Implementation of EU sanctions to facilitate continuous, high-level discussions with third countries, aiming to prevent the evasion or circumvention of the restrictive measures imposed on Russia since the beginning of its conflict with Ukraine.

Historically, Kazakhstan maintained strong economic ties with Russia, particularly in the energy sector, along its 7,500-kilometer border with the northern neighbor. However, relations faced challenges after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev emphasized Kazakhstan’s commitment to international norms by not recognizing the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. Kazakhstan also refrained from assisting Russia in circumventing sanctions, leading to assertive rhetoric from certain Russian politicians.

In response to Kazakhstan’s stance, Moscow affirmed its respect for Kazakhstan’s relations with third countries, emphasizing existing agreements that define the comprehensive nature of the alliance between the two nations, covering politics, security, trade, investment, and other spheres."

Nova, experts in marine renewables, has won European Union (EU) funding for a four megawatt tidal energy farm off the coast of Orkney which will be called Seastar.

The project will kick start the manufacture of turbines at the company’s headquarters in Edinburgh.

It will mark a crucial step in the unlocking a new global source of renewable energy in the battle against climate change.

First Minister Humza Yousaf visited Nova earlier this year. He said: “Scotland is a world leader in marine renewable energy as a result of consistent and committed support from the Scottish Government together with the expertise, investment and innovation of the industry.

“Nova’s project at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney will accelerate the development of a new industry and helps to show how Scottish ingenuity is helping us to capture the immense potential of renewable energy from our seas and oceans.”

Nova hope the project will build on the Shetland Tidal Array, the world’s first offshore tidal farm, which has been powering homes in the archipelago since 2016.

Nova say they have enhanced technology and slashed the cost of tidal energy by 40%.

The ambitious project is funded by the EU’s Horizon Europe programme, which is dedicated to fostering innovation and technology.

Simon Forrest, chief executive of Nova Innovation, said: “This is a huge win for Nova and a huge vote of confidence for the tidal energy sector.

“To be awarded the EU’s flagship tidal energy project with turbines made and deployed here in Scotland, using a pan-European supply chain, is testament to our track record of success.

“The Seastar project will see more turbines installed than all other current deployments worldwide combined. This will enable Nova to start mass manufacturing, deploy at scale and continue to drive down the cost of tidal energy.”

Nova say tidal energy in the UK could meet 11% of the current electricity demand while the global market could be worth about £125 billion by 2050."

1143118123,20231129,"After five years of intense negotiation, the proposed preferential trade agreement (PTA) between Australia and the European Union is in trouble. On 29 October 2023, talks were suspended, with little immediate prospect of resumption. This setback, plus other recent developments in EU preferential trade policy, offer some broad lessons — for both Australia and the region.

The failed negotiation is, in part, a victim of current times. With liberal trade policy in retreat, government-fuelled industrial policy is on the rise, and, according to the Eurobarometer Poll of July 2022, the majority of Europeans now view protectionism positively.

The immediate cause of breakdown in the talks was, unsurprisingly, agriculture. This is the sector that, given EU intransigence, was a key factor in the failure of the Doha Development Round of multilateral trade talks. Agriculture is still the beneficiary of massive industry assistance within the European Union.

Though there has been some reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, according to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Common Agricultural Policy outlays remain largely unchanged, at roughly one third of the European Union’s budget. And tariffs on EU farm imports remain three times higher (at some 20 per cent) than those on non-agricultural goods.

Australia’s particular concerns during negotiations with Brussels arose from EU resistance to opening up its market to Australian beef and sheepmeat, and protective geographical indications that would restrict the labelling of Australian feta cheese and prosecco. As highlighted by the WTO Trade Policy Review of the EU, the number of products subject to EU ‘geographical indication protection’ continues to rise.

Looking ahead, there are still some broad strategic factors that might favour a deal. For the European Union, this includes gaining secure access to Australia’s critical minerals, such as lithium and copper. For Australia, there is interest in reducing trade dependence on China while gaining greater participation in EU-centred supply chains. For both parties, there is a shared interest in promoting investment, skilled labour movement and trade in services.

But immediate prospects for the early and fruitful resumption of talks between Australia and the European Union are slim.

This is because of a fundamental asymmetry in respective tariff levels. Australia has an applied tariff of just 2.6 per cent on non-agricultural goods — an EU priority for export gains. In contrast, the European Union value-based duty on beef — a key Australian export priority — is 43 per cent. Tariff ‘concessions’ will have a higher political cost for Brussels than for Canberra. With elections for the European Parliament due in June 2024, that political cost is very unlikely to be incurred soon.

Two clear lessons can be drawn for the Asia-Pacific region from this setback in trade diplomacy. First, gains in agricultural exports through PTAs with the European Union will be elusive. This is particularly so where EU protection is highest — that is, according to the OECD, poultry, rice, beef and veal. Second, where geographical indications are in play, their use must be subject — as in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade agreement — to strict transparency and due process obligations.

But there is another, and potentially more worrying, lesson that might be drawn from recent developments in EU PTA policy. The latest EU preferential agreement was concluded with New Zealand in June 2022. It is the first that provides explicitly for trade sanctions for noncompliance with the labour and environment standards as contained in the International Labour Organization’s Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the Paris Agreement on climate change, respectively.

However worthy the social and environmental objectives here, it is better that they be pursued directly rather than through the blunt instrument of the trade weapon. This only heightens the ever-present risk of protectionist capture and stunted growth.

With the EU–New Zealand PTA as a potential standard setter, the threat of labour-standard or environmental sanctions is very real — albeit differentiated — for Asia-Pacific nations. This applies for those with existing agreements with Brussels — Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and the Solomon Islands. It also applies for those where PTAs are planned — namely India, Indonesia and Australia.

Against this risk, there are potential gains in economic welfare from entering into preferential deals with the European Union. But PTA gains should not be exaggerated. It is estimated that the EU–Japan trade agreement will increase long-term GDP for the European Union by just 0.76 per cent, and by an even more modest 0.29 per cent for Japan.

Preferential trade agreements are second best to multilateral liberalisation. This is because of the detrimental effect of trade diversion at the expense of non-PTA members. This diversion is compounded by the risk of regulatory proliferation and confusion — exemplified by US agreements focusing on science-based regulation, in contrast with the precautionary approach embodied in EU accords.

Rather than shed tears over the troubled Australia–EU talks, it is better to reinvigorate efforts within the WTO, in the lead up to its 13th Ministerial Conference, to strengthen the trading system on a multilateral, nondiscriminatory basis. It will be better still if such efforts are backed by widespread, unilateral, productivity-enhancing reforms at the domestic level.

1143122594,20231129,"Virgin Atlantic Boeing 787 arrives to complete the first 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel transatlantic flight from London's Heathrow airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport, in New York City, U.S., November 28, 2023. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

LONDON (Reuters) -A Virgin Atlantic passenger jet powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) completed a London-to-New York jaunt on Tuesday, showcasing the potential of low-carbon options, which are a tiny fraction of the industry's fuel mix.

The flight is not the first time the industry has staged demonstrations to highlight its aspiration to reduce emissions - and appeal for government support. Indeed, Tuesday's flight carried only Virgin's billionaire founder, Richard Branson, and a few others, and it is set to return to London using conventional jet fuel.

Airlines are banking on fuel made from waste to reduce their emissions by up to 70%, but the high cost and tight supply of materials needed to make SAF make large-scale production difficult. SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of total global jet fuel in use today and costs three to five times as much as regular jet fuel.

The flight, operated by a Virgin Boeing 787 powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, is the first time a commercial airliner has flown long haul on 100% SAF. It had no paying passengers or cargo.

""It's going to take a while before we can get enough fuel where everybody's going to be able to fly. But you've got to start somewhere,"" said Branson in London before the plane took off.

Aviation is not an easy industry to decarbonize compared to road travel, and it accounts for an estimated 2-3% of global carbon emissions.

Engines in commercial use are not yet certified to fly on more than 50% SAF and the vast majority of flights blend in a much lower amount of SAF with traditional jet fuel.

SAF is already used in jet engines as part of a blend with traditional kerosene, but after successful ground tests, Virgin and its partners Rolls-Royce, Boeing, BP and others won permission to fly using only SAF from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Canadian and UK regulators.

The flight took off at 1149 GMT from London's Heathrow Airport with Branson, Virgin Atlantic Chief Executive Shai Weiss and Britain's transport minister, Mark Harper, on board. It landed at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 1405 EST (1905 GMT), 35 minutes early, where it was met by U.S. Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg, among others.

Harper told Reuters after landing in New York that the flight was uneventful.

""If you hadn't known it was a 100% SAF flight, no one would have noticed,"" he said, calling the flight a key milestone toward 100% SAF adoption. Data from the flight ""will be as close to running a regular flight as you can get.""

He and Trottenberg plan to meet Wednesday with the investor community in New York ""about what they look for when they invest in SAF production - are there any barriers, are there any market failures, are there things governments need to do to help get this stuff over the line.""

The fuel used to power Tuesday's flight is mostly made from used cooking oil and waste animal fat mixed with a small amount of synthetic aromatic kerosene made from waste corn, Virgin Atlantic said.

The industry hopes that the Virgin flight will highlight to governments the need for them to provide financial support to make SAF more readily available.

The key to decarbonizing long haul aviation is through SAF, and for that, everyone needs to share the burden, Weiss said. He added that going forward, prices for sustainable aviation fuel will increase and they'll ""have to share it with consumers, with businesses, with the oil majors"".

""What is urgently needed is to reduce the burning of fossil jet fuels, which means reducing flights wherever possible,"" said Magdalena Heuwieser, who represents the network.

A UK military version of the Airbus A330 airliner flew on the fuel last December, fuel supplier Air bp said. Dubai's Emirates said last week it had flown an A380, the world's largest airliner, using SAF for one of four engines.

Last week, a Gulfstream G600 business jet using the same fuel successfully crossed the Atlantic.

Many European airlines - including Virgin, IAG-owned British Airways, and Air France - have said they want to be using 10% SAF by 2030. The industry's goal of ""net zero"" emissions by 2050 relies on that share rising to 65%.

Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgic said SAF was the only solution to decarbonise commercial flights in the medium term, but analysts say the 2030 target looks challenging given SAF's small volumes and its high cost.

In October, the head of IAG warned that there was more than a 90% risk the industry would not meet the European Union mandate for SAF availability in 2025. Others have said governments have not provided enough industry support.

Virgin said the engines on the flight would be drained of SAF and tested before it returns to service using regular fuel."

Red Cross representatives transferred the 12 freed hostages to Egypt, and they were later being flown by helicopter to Israeli hospitals, where their families awaited, according to the Israel Defense Forces.

Earlier, the IDF said some of its soldiers were lightly wounded in three separate explosions and an ensuing shooting in the northern part of the besieged Gaza Strip. A Hamas official who is a spokesman for its military wing said without elaborating that “a field clash” took place after Israeli troops violated the terms of the cease-fire arrangement.

The militant group, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union, pledged to adhere to the truce as long as Israel sticks to its end of the deal. Israel’s military didn’t report any fighting that would indicate a possible escalation.

The deal to pause the conflict has been extended by two days beyond its original expiration on Tuesday morning. Hamas, which released about 50 hostages as part of the original agreement, is expected to free another 20 over the next two days, in exchange for a continuation of releases of Palestinian prisoners by Israel.

U.S. officials are seeking to further extend the cease-fire and hostage releases. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Israel for the third time since Hamas attacked on Oct. 7, his office said, as he landed in Brussels for a NATO meeting.

Bill Burns, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, and the director of Israel’s Mossad were in Doha for a series of meetings initiated by Qatar to discuss the potential terms of an extended deal, a person briefed on the visit said, adding Egyptian officials are also attending. Axios had earlier reported the Burns visit.

Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, said the U.S. had airlifted more than 54,000 pounds of medical supplies and food to Egypt that would then be delivered to Gaza. This was the first of three planned shipments.

Despite disputes and delays, the truce has held during four exchanges of hostages through Monday of 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners.

An additional 18 hostages were released in separate agreements by Hamas with Thailand and Russia. Those freed by Hamas over the weekend included a 4-year-old girl – a U.S.-Israeli dual national – whose parents were killed in the group’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

Israel has released 150 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from its jails. It expects Hamas to free another 10 hostages on Tuesday, in exchange for 30 Palestinians to be let go from Israeli prisons."

After the headscarf decision, the municipality altered its terms of employment to prohibit all workers from wearing overt signs of ideological or religious affiliation, Politico reported.A court in Liege asked the top court whether this strict neutrality rule imposed by the municipality rose to discrimination contrary to EU law.The rule ""may be regarded as being objectively justified by a legitimate aim,"" the court said, but added that an opposite policy authorizing the wearing of religious symbols would also be justified.""Each member state, and any infra-state body within the framework of its competences, has a margin of discretion in designing the neutrality of the public service which it intends to promote in the workplace, depending on its own context,"" the court said.The court added: ""However, that objective must be pursued in a consistent and systematic manner, and the measures adopted to achieve it must be limited to what is strictly necessary. It is for the national courts to verify that those requirements are complied with.""In October last year, the EU court also ruled that internal laws by an employer prohibiting the visible wearing of all religious, philosophical or spiritual signs at work does not constitute direct discrimination, in a dispute between a Muslim woman and a Belgian company over its headscarf policy, Politico reported."

1143158786,20231129,"New Delhi, Nov 29: World War II ended with the first-ever use of a nuclear bomb by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan on August 6 and 9, 1945 respectively, resulting in the killing of nearly two hundred thousand civilians and the surrender of Japan a week thereafter.

What set in later was appropriately called the period of ‘Cold War’, in which nuclear deterrence rooted in the theory of ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’(MAD) kept the two superpowers from initiating a full-scale war. These were also the years of a tense ideological divide of the world between International Communism with state control of the economy and the Capitalist model of the Free Market.

The Vietnam War in the meanwhile revealed that military armament could work against the government but not necessarily defeat a people whose minds had been turned by an ideology.

The ‘asymmetry’ of the Vietnam battle was an indicator of the era of ‘proxy wars’ that would follow once the Cold War ended with the withdrawal of the Soviet army from Afghanistan and the consequent dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the demise of International Communism in 1991.

Post-Cold War, open warfare evidently gave way to ‘covert’ offensives by way of instigation of cross-border terror attacks, support to insurgencies and promotion of separatist movements.

The end of the Cold War coincided with the rise of faith-based terrorism because the anti-Soviet armed campaign was run on the war cry of Jehad and conducted in an asymmetric mode.

The US gave all credit to Pakistan for the success of the ‘Afghan war’ clearly in ignorance of the fact that Pak ISI had also patronised Islamic radicals of Taliban and Al Qaeda and managed to install the Taliban Emirate in Kabul in 1996 knowing well that these outfits considered US-led West as their first enemy.

The contradiction surfaced soon enough for the US to work for the ouster of the Emirate – which laid the turf for 9/11 – and realise the seriousness of the threat posed by Islamic radicals to its own security and the security of its allies.

The ‘war on terror’ launched by the US-led coalition first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq, saw radicalisation spreading in the Muslim world at the expense of the fundamentalist but pro-US regimes like Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrein.

The radical outfits used faith-based motivation as the instrument of terrorism. Pakistan has been riding two horses – trying to be in the good books of the US and collaborating at the same time with the radical forces of Taliban, Al Qaeda and ISIS.

Further, Pakistan’s strategic alliance with China multiplied the security threats to India specifically but the US-led West did not always see it from the Indian perspective which added to the challenge for Indian diplomacy and the country’s security set-up.

In the era of proxy wars, there is increasing reliance on the power of technology for combat. The strategy of countering ‘covert’ offensives of the adversary required political will and in the Narendra Modi regime, this has been coming forth in adequate measure.

Incidentally, there is a learning for Israeli security from the Hamas terror attack of October 7 – that technology should not be allowed to override the importance of human Intelligence.

It is interesting that the Russian military intervention in southern Ukraine in February 2022 was termed as a cross-border ‘operation’ and not a ‘war’ by President Vladimir Putin who spoke up for safeguarding the legitimate interests of the Russian-speaking population of the region. The US responded in a ‘proxy’ mode – supplying Ukraine with armament, putting economic sanctions on Russia and denouncing Russia’s action in the UN.

The surprise terrorist offensive launched by Hamas on Israel on the morning of October 7 from across the border killing over 1400 civilians including women and children – who were in the midst of celebrating the annual Sukkot musical festival – showed deep planning and secret mobilisation of resources.

Even though the attack was accompanied by an open warfare element of thousands of rockets being fired on Israel, these were meant basically to provide ‘cover’ to the Hamas militants to infiltrate en masse into the Israeli territory to unleash violence on civilians and create an atmosphere of terror in the area.

Hamas pursuing the radical agenda engineered this provocative attack knowing well that Israel would launch an all-out military retaliation which in ultimate analysis would lead to further radicalisation of the Arab world and draw the US-led West into a protracted military conflict.

Israel-Hamas confrontation has opened a second front for the US after the Ukraine-Russia ‘war’- this time around it is even messier than the latter because it has makings of a ‘war of religions’ as against the ‘political’ character of the Russian military offensive on Ukraine.

The US backing of Israel has shades of another ‘war on terror’ that the US had led following 9/11 – Israel is leading that counter-offensive in this case.

An additional challenge for the US is that because of the ideological opposition of Shia fundamentalism to the US, Iran is joining the Hamas side of the conflict through its militant wing – Hezbollah – operating out of Lebanon.

Islamic radicals and Shia fundamentalists are on the same side of the fence politically because of their shared hostility towards the US – even though left to themselves they would be at each other’s throats in terms of religious contradiction.

US President Joe Biden hit the nail on the head when he stated at a press conference in Washington on October 25 – occasioned by the visit of the Australian Prime Minister – that he instinctively believed one reason behind the Hamas attack on Israel was the recent announcement of India-Middle East- Europe Economic Corridor designed to integrate the entire region with a network of rail, road and ports to the great benefit of Israel as well.

It was during the G20 summit at New Delhi that India, the US, UAE, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union signed a Memorandum of Understanding for establishing this economic corridor.

According to President Biden, this was a major effort to build a more sustainable and integrated Middle East by creating opportunities for investment across two continents.

What the US President should have added is that the forces of radical Islam have been on the rise in West Asia and elsewhere – led by Arab states like Qatar, Yemen and Syria – and were even confronting countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE which had struck strategic friendship with the US and accepted the idea of an accord with Israel.

Islamic radicals are politically leaning towards China, a country that had already struck a relationship with the Taliban Emirate at Kabul, in its march towards becoming a superpower opposed to the US.

Meanwhile, Netanyahu has declared that Israel was in the midst of a ‘fight for its existence’ and will aim at ‘eliminating Hamas by destroying the latter’s military and governance capabilities and getting Israeli hostages back’.

Israel was evidently engaged in planning a comprehensive military offensive taking into account the formidable network of underground tunnels built by Hamas in Gaza for its defence.

India has done well to denounce outright the terror attack of Hamas on Israel coming on the same page as the US, welcoming the Abraham Accord being worked out between Israel on one hand and Saudi Arabia and UAE on the other and supporting the idea of peaceful coexistence between Israel and a Palestinian state.

The spread of radicalisation adds to the security threat India already faces from Pakistan’s relentless sponsoring of cross-border terrorism in Kashmir and elsewhere and the determination of the Sino-Pak axis to destabilise this country.

India has taken the lead in despatching substantial humanitarian aid for taking care of the injured and displaced civilians in Gaza and thus giving a message for a peaceful resolution of the dispute in Palestine.

Whatever happened in the past, the Arab world today should find a way of recognising the state of Israel while demanding an honourable and equitable solution to the Palestinian issue.

Many Muslim leaders in India have sided with Hamas against Israel on communal lines, ignoring the danger that the democratic world as a whole would face if there were wars precipitated in the name of religion.

Border states of Kashmir and Punjab will require closer attention in the global environment created by the Hamas terror attack on Israel.

Pak ISI was continuing with the mischief of instigating protagonists of Khalistan abroad. Our Intelligence agencies are totally attuned to dealing with these threats.

The security scenario for India is particularly affected by the global trends of open warfare giving way to covert offensives, the Muslim world witnessing a constant rise of radicals and a new Cold War making its appearance between the US-led West on one hand and Xi Jinping’s China – as the head of what was the Communist block in the past – on the other.

China is in active pursuit of military, economic and political expansion and is alive to Sun Tzu’s precept of ‘deception’ in warfare and the theory of ‘two steps forward, one step backwards’ to achieve its objective in an unhurried way. Attacking the economic assets of the opponent, using social media for indoctrination and for ‘information warfare’ and launching cyber attacks are all in full use as the instruments of ‘proxy war’.

China held a high-profile world conference on the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) in Beijing on October 17-18 — the third since the BRI was launched a decade ago — that drew the top leaders of some 130 countries including Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia and Sri Lanka apart from a representative of Taliban.

President Putin was present — he had attended the earlier two meets as well – marking the advance of the ‘No limits friendship’ between Russia and China.

BRI was the outcome of China’s global infrastructure development strategy for connecting Asia with Africa and Europe through land and maritime routes.

The Beijing conference was designed to project China politically as the global leader of the anti-US block, step up Xi Jinping’s plans of making China a superpower through both military and economic routes and demonstrate China’s anti-West stand in both Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas military conflicts.

The Beijing event firmed up the contours of the emerging Cold War with China -not Russia -leading the anti-US forces.

India’s strategy of pursuing bilateral and multilateral relationships for mutual security and economic gains while working for the cause of world peace puts it on the same side as the US and Israel particularly because the Sino-Pak axis working against India represented the forces of Marxist dictatorship and those harbouring Islamic radicalism.

The situation warranted that India and the US – the two largest democracies – must join hands to protect the democratic world order against these forces.

India has emerged through its G20 Presidency as a major world power whose counsel mattered on the issues of war and peace – this places India in a challenging position where it has to project its own security and economic interests as part of the larger humanitarian cause of making the world a better and safer place for everybody. Prime Minister Modi and his strategic advisors are handling this challenge very successfully."

1143167458,20231129,"On Tuesday, Margaritis Schinas, Vice President for the Promotion of the European Way of Life, commenced his visit to Australia with the aim of strengthening EU-Australia cooperation from a people-centric perspective, particularly in the areas of security, skills, innovation, and culture.

During a reception held in his honour at the Hellenic Museum in Melbourne, Mr Schinas had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the diaspora and engage in conversations with them.

A brief overview of Melbourne’s Hellenism was presented to Mr Schinas by the Consul General of Greece, Mr Emmanouil Kakavelakis, starting from the arrival of the Hydraian sailors and reaching the present day.

Mr Kakavelakis, highlighting the dynamism that characterises the diaspora, also emphasized the unity within the community.

The event was hosted by Spyros Alatsas, and Mr Schinas was welcomed with speeches by Bishop Kyriakos of Sozopolis and the President of the Greek Community of Melbourne, Vasilis Papastergiadis.

In his address, Mr. Schinas referred to his grandparents, mentioning that one immigrated to the United States and served in the U.S. Army before returning to Greece, while the other, Ionas, went to Thessaloniki after the Asia Minor Catastrophe.

“Sometimes I think about what they would say about me, their grandson, who is responsible for Migration in the European Union,” he said.

After praising Greece and its diaspora, Mr Schinas spoke about the change of the country’s page, highlighting remarkable progress stressing that “common ideals and values unite Europe with Australia, and nothing will separate them, not even… cheese!”

Later on the same day, he delivered a speech at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) and, in addition to the Hellenic Museum, visited the Melbourne Holocaust Museum. There, he had the opportunity to meet Holocaust survivors and members of the Jewish community.The Greek Community of Melbourne (GCM) also welcomed Vice President of the European Commission (EC), Mr Margaritis Schinas, on his first visit to the Greek Centre in what proved to be an informative display of the efforts achieved by Melbourne’s Hellenic diaspora.

Mr Schinas was afforded the chance to visit the Greek Centre, accompanied by Consul General of Greece in Melbourne, Emmanuel Kakavelakis and the European Union Ambassador to Australia, Gabriele Visentin, where he was welcomed by various members of the GCM Board.

The EC Vice President’s official business in the country is to strengthen EU-Australia cooperation, with his mission being to promote the European way of life and the exploration of collaborative opportunities in areas such as cultural exchange, economic cooperation, and talent migration.

Taking a slight detour, Mr Schinas was able to tour the Greek Centre and get an overview of the GCM’s cultural and educational activities.

He thanked the various GCM representatives, including President Bill Papastergiadis OAM, for their warm hospitality, and said he was deeply impressed with the GCM’s 15 storey building, noting how it was a landmark globally for all Hellenes.

“Greeks in Melbourne have a deep and important presence. What you have achieved is significant and it is equally important that your work is supported by the Australian Government,” said Mr Schinas.

Mr Papastergiadis expressed gratitude for the EC Vice President’s visit and his commitment to strengthening EU-Australia cooperation.

He stressed the importance of preserving and celebrating Greek heritage in the diaspora and the evolution of the GCM, which has become a vibrant hub for Greek cultural expression with over 100 events annually.

“Melbourne is a truly cosmopolitan city and it is a leading example of how multiculturalism is supported so as to achieve societal outcomes,” the GCM President said.

“As part of your role in leading the “European Way of Living”, our work in Melbourne can and should be used as part of learnings on how different communities can come together and work cooperatively”.

Regarding Mr Schinas’ visit, Mr Kakavelakis mentioned “it’s a great honour that Mr. Schinas has visited Melbourne, and he can reflect our culture in the high-profile meetings with the Australian officials”.

The EC Vice President was presented a copy of the book on the history of the Greek Orthodox Community of Melbourne and Victoria from its foundation in 1897 to 1972, along with a community plaque to acknowledge his visit.

Mr Schinas had a short discussion with the author of the book, Mrs Harpantidou, and stated that “through those collective efforts we are underscoring the vital importance of safeguarding and celebrating Greek heritage within the diaspora, and we can move forward”.

Along with Mr Papastergiadis, Anthea Sidiropoulos (Vice President), Michael Karamitos (Vice President), Nick Koukouvitakis (Secretary), Vicki Kyritsis (Assistant Secretary), Dr Spiridoula Demetriou and Christos Sikavitsas from the GCM Board were also present.

Ms Sidiropoulos stated that “we appreciate Vice President Schinas’ vision and commitment to promote the European way of life globally and to focus on skill development, immigration & corporation” while Michael Karamitos also expressed his sincere gratitude for his visit.

Focusing on his official business, Mr Schinas also shed light on his overall mission in coming to Australia.

Drawing inspiration from the successes of Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada, as highlighted in his recent article, Mr Schinas aims to foster a dynamic labour market within the European Union through what he terms the “EU talent pool”.

“The United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are ‘very powerful competitors who have straightforward avenues for third country nationals’ to immigrate and take up skilled professions, enriching their economies,” Mr Schinas said.

In the coming days, the EC Vice President will participate in a series of events/discussions with members of the Australian government and institutional representatives, engagements with members of the European-Australian Business Council to enhance skills and talent mobility, and members of the Greek diaspora.

From Wednesday to Thursday, while in Canberra he will also address the handling of information manipulation and interventions from abroad. The Vice President will also meet with the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as well as members of mixed parliamentary committees on information and security, human rights, external affairs, defense, and trade.

On Friday, he will travel to Sydney, where he will visit the Sydney Biomedical Accelerator and participate in a roundtable discussion with members of the European-Australian Business Council. The discussion will focus on the European Commission’s recent initiatives to enhance skills and talent mobility. The Vice President will conclude his visit on Saturday, meeting the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and participating in the cultural diplomacy event “Europe in Australia” organised by the EU at the Sydney Opera House.

The event is dedicated to Maria Callas, celebrating 100 years of art and innovation."

1143162976,20231129,"India becomes the 2nd largest supplier of refined oil to Europe, thanks to cheap Russian crude

India has become the European Union’s second-largest supplier of refined petroleum products in 2023, despite relying almost fully on imported crude, thanks to the availability of cheap Russian oil imports. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of several trade sanctions on Moscow, Saudi Arabia has been the largest supplier of refined petroleum products to Europe.

 

According to reports, the European Union imported a cumulative 7.9 million tonnes of refined petroleum products from India between January and September of this year. This figure is more than double the amount on a yearly basis and triple the volumes from the same period in 2021. India’s refined petroleum products volume for this year catapulted it from sixth place in 2022 to first place in 2023. France, the Netherlands, and Italy emerged as the three biggest importers, followed by Croatia, Latvia, Romania, and Germany.

 

India holds the position of the second-largest oil refiner in Asia after China. The country imports around 40 percent of the crude oil it refines from Russia, with volumes increasing exponentially due to a discount on Russian crude oil amidst Western sanctions. Interestingly, Russian crude continues to make its way into European markets indirectly via alternative channels. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), Bulgaria’s Black Sea, Neftochim Burgas refinery imported over 4.95 million tonnes of Russian crude between January and October 2023.

 

Bulgaria was granted an exemption from the EU’s Russian oil embargo implemented in late 2022 in order to ensure sufficient domestic supply. However, Russian oil is being supplied to the European markets via India (refined oil) and crude through smaller countries in Europe. CREA finds Bulgaria as the fourth-largest imported of Russian seaborne crude, after India, China, and Turkey. It is worth mentioning here that Western countries led by the United States of America and the European Union imposed economic and other trade sanctions on Russia after its offensive in Ukraine in February 2022.

 

Diesel exports

Europe suspended most oil shipments from Russia almost a year ago, but continued to buy diesel that may well have been made from Russian crude oil. The region's imports of diesel from India, one of the largest importers of Russian crude oil, are on course to soar to 305,000 barrels per day (bpd), the highest since at least January 2017, data compiled by the market intelligence agency Kpler showed.

 

Since India imports crude oil from other countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and a number of other countries, it cannot be accurately said that New Delhi’s diesel exports to Europe is made of Russian crude. However, given that the volume of exports increasing significantly, one can easily assume that the diesel being exported to Europe is made of Russian crude. Meanwhile, increasing Moscow’s crude deliveries has given Indian refineries the ability to produce abundant diesel and boost exports.

 

Arrivals into Europe in November include a rare shipment from Mumbai-based Nayara Energy Ltd, which imported almost 60 percent of its crude oil from Russia this year. Reliance Industries Ltd, Europe’s leading supplier of Indian diesel, draws more than a third of its crude oil from Russia, Kpler reported. This is considered Europe’s fundamental shift towards India after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The European Union banned most seaborne imports from Russian crude oil in December and oil products in February.

 

World beyond the West

Commenting on the rapid change in the global trade order from uni-polarity to multi-polarity, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, “The world is much more than Europe with an increase in trading partners such as ‘global south’ and ‘global east’. The key difference of the ongoing multi-polarity is the opportunity to acquire genuinely global proportions, relying on the fundamental principle of the United Nations Charter – The sovereign equality of states.”

 

Speaking at the Primakov Readings International Forum in Moscow, Lavrov said on Tuesday, “Previously, decisions of global importance were driven by a small group of countries with the predominant voice coming from the Western community, for obvious reasons. Today, new players representing the ‘global south’ and ‘global east’ have stepped onto the international political stage and their growing numbers. We can call them ‘global majority’. They are strengthening their sovereignty on addressing pressing issues, demonstrating independence, and prioritizing their national interests rather than someone else’s whims.”

 

India emerges stronger trade partner for Europe

India has emerged as a stronger trade partner for Europe now than earlier. Decoupled from Russia after the war in Ukraine, Europe was looking for a new trade partner to fulfill the trade in the changed world order. Russia’s conflict with Ukraine was so sudden and severe that it changed the business dynamics and created a new trade order with the entire world dividing into either support or against the war. This war impacted the European countries dramatically being the entire Europe heavily depended upon Russian energy.

 

The Ukraine war changed the overall perception of many European economies. In fact, no one was expecting this war to be prolonged so much to continue even in the 21st months. Being economic and financial consequences very much associated with the increase in oil and gas prices, European economies immediately tried to reduce dependence on Russian oil and look for alternative suppliers. Now, Europe is taking advantage of a stronger trade relationship with India and the rest of the world to deal with the immediate change in the global energy order.

He expressed these views while addressing the International Conference on Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling in Brussels.

The Foreign Minister was on a two-day visit to Brussels, Belgium, at the invitation of the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson.

Jalil Abbas Jilani emphasized the need for legal pathways for migration to curb irregular migration and migrant smuggling. He also highlighted the steps taken by the Government of Pakistan to curb irregular migration.

On the sidelines of the Conference, the Foreign Minister held meetings with senior European Union's officials and members of the European Parliament.

In his meeting with EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, the Foreign Minister welcomed the progress under the recently launched Migration and Mobility Dialogue, including opening of legal pathways for migration and operationalization of Talent Partnership.

He also held meeting with Vice President of the European Parliament and the Rapporteur of the new GSP Plus Scheme, Heidi Hautala, Chairperson of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, David Macalister, and EU Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpalinen.

Terming GSP Plus as a template for mutually beneficial economic cooperation, the Foreign Minister expressed the hope that the scheme would continue to support developing economies without adding excessive conditionalities.

Regional developments in the Middle East and South Asia, including the situation in Indian illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir were also discussed in these meetings.

On Tuesday, the ministry issued a report stating that Raffaella Ludovica, the head of the European Union’s office in Afghanistan, along with her delegation, had a meeting and discussions at the ministry’s headquarters.

The Ministry has added that concurrently with this meeting, the European Union has allocated 142 million euros to newly expelled migrants from Iran and Pakistan.

Khalil Rahman Haqqani, the head of this ministry, provided clarification on the forced return of migrants from Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran, including their numbers. He emphasized that host countries of migrants, especially Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, should refrain from any mistreatment and illegal confiscation of the assets and properties of their migrants.

Furthermore, on the sidelines of this meeting, the Ministry called on the European Union for cooperation and assistance in providing shelter, tents, and food to returnees while ensuring accountability and transparency.

Earlier, the European Union had allocated 61 million euros to meet the needs of Afghan refugees and other Afghans expelled from Pakistan.

Recently, as Afghanistan witnessed the daily expulsion of thousands of Afghans from Pakistan, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan has intensified even further with the onset of the winter season."

The Union of Turkish Bar Associations (TBB) has partnered with the European Union and the Council of Europe to sign a grant agreement aimed at providing free legal aid to women who have fallen victim to violence in Türkiye.

The head of the Council of Europe's Ankara office, William Massolin, stated at the project's opening ceremony that they are determined to effect positive change and that the fight for women's rights must continue as a collective effort.

Caterina Bolognese, head of the Gender Equality Unit, emphasized that women living in rural areas, women with disabilities and refugees in particular lack access to legal solutions and that the grant project is intended to effect change.

Ambassador Nikolaus Meyer-Landrut, head of the European Union delegation to Türkiye, stated, ""Violent behavior directed at women transcends national and racial boundaries. Globally, one in every three women experiences physical or sexual violence. In 2022, 334 females were murdered in Türkiye, and an additional 245 perished under suspicious circumstances.""

Meyer-Landrut further stated that access to justice is meaningless in the absence of separation of powers and an effective and independent judiciary.

""Economic hardships are one of the primary barriers to accessing justice,"" TBB President Erinç Sağkan stated, adding that women continue to be subjected to numerous rights violations, particularly the right to life and gender-based violence on a global scale.

""Legal aid is neither a gesture of solidarity nor a choice; rather, it is a societal obligation to assist disadvantaged groups. Unfortunately, the current capabilities in this field fall far short of the demands,"" Sağkan added.

After the opening speeches, the grant agreement supporting the provision of legal aid for women was signed. In the beginning, the ""Supporting Women's Access to Justice in Türkiye"" initiative will be executed in eight of the country's 81 provinces, giving special consideration to regions severely affected by earthquakes."

The ""Final Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Final Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the volume-weighted average prices per metal unit at which the Metal Agent (defined below) is able to sell the underlying Metal (""Average Metal Sale Price"") during the Final Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Final Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Final Redemption Valuation Date. ""Final Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date specified in the Final Terms or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. ""Specified Interest Amount"" is the amount of interest per ETC Security equal to that ETC Security's pro rata share of the amount of interest which has accrued (if any) on the proceeds of realisation of the underlying Metal deposited into the Series Cash Account (defined below) during or relating to the relevant redemption disposal period. Whilst interest may accrue at a positive, zero or negative rate on the Series Cash Account, the Specified Interest Amount is subject to a minimum of zero and any negative interest shall instead be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the underlying Metal. If any of the early redemption events occur, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Early Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Early Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount and (ii) the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Early Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Early Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the Average Metal Sale Price during the Early Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Early Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Early Redemption Valuation Date. The ""Scheduled Early Redemption Date"" is the 8th business day following the Early Redemption Disposal Period. The ""Early Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date of the occurrence of an early redemption event or the date on which the Trustee gives notice that, due to the occurrence of an event of default, the ETC Securities shall become due and payable at their Early Redemption Amount on the Scheduled Early Redemption Date, or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. There can be no assurance that the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, will be greater than or equal to the amount invested by any securityholder. If the Final Metal Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, plus the Specified Interest Amount falls below the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount, then due to the limited recourse nature of the ETC Securities, securityholders are unlikely to receive payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, in full and may receive zero. The Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount per ETC Security, as applicable, will be determined by reference to the Average Metal Sale Price of the underlying Metal held in respect of the ETC Securities sold during the Final Redemption Disposal Period or Early Redemption Disposal Period, as applicable, by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (or any successor or replacement) as ""Metal Agent"", net of associated deductions and taxes. The Issuer will, on or prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date or Scheduled Early Redemption Date, publish the determination of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, (which shall include publication of the price, volume and date of each sale of underlying Metal during the relevant redemption disposal period, including information on any fees, deductions and/or taxes imposed on such sale, and the determination of the Average Metal Sale Price) on the website maintained on behalf of the Issuer at www.etf.dws.com (or such other website notified by the Issuer for the ETC Securities from time to time). The Metal Agent will pay the aggregate proceeds of such disposals (converted, if necessary, into the currency of the ETC Securities) to the cash account for the Series (the ""Series Cash Account"") maintained by J.P. Morgan SE as ""Account Bank"" as directed by the Programme Administrator (defined below). The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest. On early or final redemption of the ETC Securities, a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security, as the case may be. The ETC Securities are subject to a product fee that accrues on a daily basis. Accrued product fee is paid by a daily reduction in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security which, as a result of such reduction, operates as a charge on securityholders. The Issuer will, using the Metal Agent, periodically realise Metal equal to such charge and the proceeds will be credited to the Series Cash Account maintained by the Account Bank in relation to the ETC Securities and used by the Issuer to pay the product fee to the Programme Administrator in accordance with the Programme Administrator Agreement. Such realisation will happen on a periodic (typically weekly) basis. The Programme Administrator Agreement provides that the Programme Administrator will use the product fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities to pay on behalf of the Issuer the costs of the Programme (as set out in the schedule to the Programme Administrator Agreement) relating to such Series of ETC Securities and the Issuer more generally. The ETC Securities may become due and payable prior to their Scheduled Maturity Date in connection with the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) certain legal or regulatory changes occur in relation to the Issuer and the Issuer gives a notice of redemption; (ii) any agent in relation to the ETC Securities resigns or their appointment is terminated and the Issuer gives notice that no successor or replacement has been appointed within a 60 calendar day period; (iii) the Value per ETC Security is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price as at the series issue date for two consecutive valuation days and the determination agent gives the relevant notice; (iv) the Issuer will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, be required to make a payment in respect of VAT or be required to account for VAT in respect of a delivery of Metal from or to an authorised participant (whether or not such VAT is recoverable); (v) an Issuer Call Redemption Event occurs (as discussed further below under ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""); (vi) the Issuer becomes entitled to serve a VAT redemption event notice and the Trustee gives the relevant notice as directed by the requisite number of securityholders; or (vii) an event of default occurs under the ETC Securities. These include certain breaches by the Issuer of its obligations that are not cured within the applicable cure period and certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer. The Issuer may elect to redeem the ETC Securities early on giving not less than 30 calendar days' notice to securityholders (an ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""). The ETC Securities will rank equally amongst themselves. The rights of securityholders are limited in recourse to the Secured Property. As such, once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed, none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors, officers, members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and, therefore, the rights of securityholders will rank in accordance therewith. As a result of such provisions, the securityholders may not receive in full the final redemption amount or early redemption amount payable in respect of an ETC Security. All payments in respect of the ETC Securities shall be made net of and after allowance for any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes. In the event that any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes applies to payments in respect of the ETC Securities, securityholders will be subject to such tax or deduction and shall not be entitled to receive amounts to compensate for any such tax or deduction. No event of default will occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction. The ETC Securities will be governed by the laws of Ireland. There will be two security deeds relating to the ETC Securities; one will be governed by the laws of Ireland and the other will be governed by English law.

The ETC Securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") or under the securities law of any state or political sub-division of the United States of America or any of its territories, possessions or other areas subject to its jurisdiction including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Issuer has not been and will not be registered under any federal laws of the United States of America. The ETC Securities include ETC Securities in bearer form that are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. No person has registered nor will register as a commodity pool operator of the Issuer under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the ""CEA"") and the rules thereunder (the ""CFTC Rules"") of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the ""CFTC""). Any offer or sale of the ETC Securities must be made in an offshore transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Regulation S thereunder (""Regulation S""). The ETC Securities may not at any time be offered, sold or otherwise transferred in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, persons who are either (a) U.S. persons as defined in Regulation S or (b) persons who do not come within the definition of a non-United States person under CFTC Rule 4.7 (excluding for the purposes of subsection (d) thereof, the exception to the extent it would apply to persons who are not non-United States persons).

· The amount payable in respect of the ETC Securities is linked to the performance of the underlying Metal. Prices of precious metals are generally more volatile than prices in other asset classes. If the value of such underlying Metal falls that will reduce amounts payable in respect of the ETC Securities. · The Value per ETC Security, secondary market price and the redemption amount of ETC Securities will primarily be affected by the performance and level of the underlying Metal, rate movements, market perception, the creditworthiness of the Metal Agent, the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian and any applicable sub-custodian and liquidity in the ETC Securities. · The securityholders and other transaction parties will have recourse only to the Secured Property in respect of the ETC Securities and not to any other assets of the Issuer. If, following realisation in full of the Secured Property relating to the ETC Securities, any outstanding claim remains unpaid, then such claim will be extinguished and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect thereof. · The Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is subject to the deduction of the product fee. · The Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount (if any) operates as a minimum repayment amount on the early or final redemption of the ETC Securities. However, in the event that the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is insufficient to fund the Minimum Debt Principal Amount payable in respect of each ETC Security to all securityholders on such early or final redemption, such securityholders may not receive payment of the Minimum Debt Principal Amount in full and may receive substantially less. · The Issuer and securityholders are exposed to the credit risk of the Metal Agent, the Programme Administrator (defined below), the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian, the Account Bank, and any sub-custodian and the authorised participants. · Any disruption to a price source or relevant association may affect the Value per ETC Security and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security. · Certain events may lead to an early redemption of the ETC Securities. · ETC Securities may have a long term and the only means through which an investor can realise value from an ETC Security prior to its Scheduled Maturity Date is to sell it at its then market price in a secondary market transaction. While each authorised participant may make a market for the ETC Securities, no authorised participant is obliged to make a market for any series of ETC Securities and an authorised participant may discontinue making a market at any time. Furthermore, any market in ETC Securities may not be liquid and the secondary market price (if any) for ETC Securities may be substantially less than the price paid by the investor. · With respect to any redemption disposal period, if the proceeds from the realisation of the underlying Metal would cause the balance standing to the Series Cash Account to exceed the maximum amount that can be held during the period between December and January of each calendar year (such amount and such period to be agreed from time to time between the Issuer, the Programme Administrator and the Account Bank (the ""Year-End Period"")), then the Programme Administrator may postpone the redemption date until after the Year-End Period, during which time the Metal Agent will not deposit such proceeds into the Series Cash Account and interest equal to the Specified Interest Amount will not accrue on such proceeds for so long as they are not deposited into the Series Cash Account.

However, in connection with ongoing or future restructuring and/or reorganisations within the DWS group, it is possible that some of the roles currently performed by DWS International GmbH may be novated, delegated or otherwise transferred to a different entity within the DWS group without the prior written consent of securityholders or the Trustee, provided that it is legally permitted to make such novation, delegation or transfer. DWS International GmbH acting through any of its branches or affiliates may also be an Authorised Participant in relation to a series of ETC Securities. DWS International GmbH has been, or may be, appointed to act as a distributing entity in respect of the ETC Securities. DWS International GmbH, the Programme Administrator, has certain discretions to adjust the levels of the Base Fee Percentage and the FX Hedging Fee Percentage (and, therefore, the Product Fee Percentage and the Product Fee) in relation to each Series of ETC Securities. The remuneration of the Programme Administrator is included in the Product Fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities and depends on the amount of the Product Fees and their sufficiency to cover the costs of the Programme. A DWS entity and/or its affiliates may engage in trading and market-making activities and may hold long or short positions in any metal, other instruments or derivative products based on or related to the metal, metal for their proprietary accounts or for other accounts under their management.

1143225175,20231129,"Meta has laid out plans for political advertising in 2024, as some of the world's biggest democracies — including the United States, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and the European Union — are set to hold elections.

On Wednesday, the tech giant revealed its blueprint for the upcoming elections, which remains largely consistent with previous years. Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Meta, announced in a blog post that this includes the blocking of new political ads one week before U.S. voters go to the polls in Nov. 2024. Clegg also referred to the $20 billion the company has invested in safety and security for global elections since 2016, writing, ""No tech company does more or invests more to protect elections online than Meta — not just during election periods but at all times.""

Meta also said it has identified over 700 hate groups from around the world, of which 400 are white supremacist organizations, in an effort to fight interference operations and harassment.

A key difference, however, will be seen in the face of consumer-generated AI content. Earlier this month, Meta announced that it will require political advertisers to disclose AI-generated content posted to Facebook and Instagram. This pertains to any image, footage or audio that is ""digitally created or altered"" to depicting something or someone that did not truly occur or exist. Meta's policy will apply to all social issues, electoral, or political advertisements, globally.

Political advertising on Meta's platforms has and continues to be a contentious matter. During previous elections, accusations of rampant misinformation — and a clear failure to block said misinformation — have tainted Meta's self-declared reputation of prioritising the protection of elections online. Globally, the company has been accused of charging less to certain parties than others for advertising, including India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. In 2020, the U.S. Federal Election Commissioner criticized Facebook's permittance of political ads, saying, ""The company has no idea how seriously it is hurting democracy."""

1143237410,20231129,"JERUSALEM. Israel – The exchange of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners in Israel continues as a four-day ceasefire in Gaza now stretches into six days.

Hamas freed 12 more hostages, while Israel let 30 more Palestinian prisoners go free on the fifth day of the ceasefire. It is due to end on Wednesday, its sixth day, but negotiators are hoping for another extension.

Word is getting out about how hostage children were treated. The aunt of one child who has been freed says their captors forced them to watch videos of the October 7th massacres and ordered them to stop crying at gunpoint. She also says they also beat the children.

The father of nine-year-old freed hostage Emily Hand says she cries uncontrollably, and her captors made her stay so quiet she can now only whisper.

In Israel, a medical official overseeing freed hostages described the condition and the spirit of the adult females among them. Professor Itai Pessach, the director of Edmond & Lily Safra Children's Hospital, said they were ""a group of extraordinary women that endured the hardships of their captivity in a remarkable fashion... some suffered injuries when they were abducted or during their time in captivity, but there's no immediate danger to any of them.""

Meanwhile, the Biden administration is leaning on Israel to go easier on southern Gaza than it has on the north when fighting resumes. The White House points out millions of Gazans fled south when the Israeli military attacked the north, so there's really nowhere else for those civilians to go. Surveys like AP polling show Americans still back Israel but worry about non-combatants in Gaza.

""The American people are broadly supportive of Israel's right to defend itself. There's also growing concern for the plight of civilians in Gaza,"" said Associated Press reporter Zeke Miller.

But since Hamas hides out among civilians, that could make it almost impossible for Israel to achieve its goal of destroying Hamas – a goal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told troops fighting in Gaza they must achieve if Israelis are to ever feel safe and secure again.

In another development, Germany and the European Union are freezing funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency or UNRWA. The agency’s education programs for millions of Palestinian youth over the years are accused of teaching anti-Semitism and glorifying terrorism in its classroom materials.

A report by the watchdog group UN Watch profiles 118 UNRWA-educated Palestinians who went on to commit terrorist acts against Israel. The same report also shows a number of UNRWA teachers or workers celebrating the October 7th massacres. One said of the brutal attacks, ""This is an unforgettable glorious morning.""

Israel is fighting back with more than guns, tanks, and jets. There's also prayer. The Knesset, Israel's parliament, was the site of a Wednesday prayer meeting. Many Christians joined their Jewish brothers and sisters to pray.

1143244848,20231129,"The European Union (EU) has asked the federal and state governments to take the battle against Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) to new heights by funding the 41 existing Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) across the country.

The appeal came against the backdrop of the revelation by the EU that over a billion Naira has been expended so far on establishment and sustenance of SARCs across the country.

Speaking on Wednesday in Abuja at the 9th Network Conference of Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) – one of the activities lined up for the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence 2023 – the EU Ambassador and Head of Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Samuela Isopi, disclosed that over 35,000 survivors have so far benefitted from the services of the centres across the country.

He said the federal and state governments need to take ownership of SARCs by adequately funding them.

Themed ‘Funding and Sustainability of Sexual Assault Referral Centres’, the event was organised by the European Union-funded Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption (RoLAC Phase II) Programme of International Initiative for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, funded by the European Union.

Isopi said the funding will go a long way to strengthen the centres to deliver on their mandate of providing free medical, counseling and support services to survivors of sexual violence.

While assuring that the EU is committed to ensuring that voices of victims are heard, Isopi insisted that the establishment of specialised courts for sexual and gender-based violence cases across the country would go a long way in getting prompt justice and reducing incidents SGBV.

She said: “In Nigeria, the European Union has contributed over a billion naira in support of SARCs across the country and we will continue to advocate for more centres and for appropriate funding allocations at federal and state level to make them operational and sustainable.

“Addressing violence against women and girls requires a comprehensive and collective approach. We will continue to collaborate with key stakeholders in supporting legislative instruments.”

The Project Manager, Access to Justice and Co-ordinator, Network of Sexual Assault Referral Centres, RoLAC II, Oluwatoyosi Giwa, said SARCs were expected to provide free medical assistance, forensic medical examination, counseling and justice support services to survivors of the act."

1143246596,20231129,"A Russian general has reportedly been blown up by a landmine along the front line in Ukraine.

Major General Vladimir Zavadsky, deputy commander of the 14th Army Corps, was said to have stepped on the explosive on Tuesday.

His death was first reported by Colonel Anatoly Stefan, a Ukrainian military officer.

It was not immediately clear where he was killed.

Several Russian generals have reportedly died in Ukraine since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February last year.

Thanks for following today’s liveblog.

We will be back tomorrow morning for all the latest updates.

Russia has launched nearly 20 airstrikes in a renewed assault on Avdiivka, Ukraine has said.

Oleksandr Tarnavsky, the Ukrainian commander responsible for the territory, said Moscow had “significantly increased its activity” and was using armoured vehicles.

He said Russian forces had carried out nearly 20 airstrikes, launched four missiles and thrown 56 assault waves at his forces, and fired more than 1,000 artillery rounds.

The industrial town of Avdiivka in the eastern Donetsk region has become a recent flashpoint of Moscow’s invasion.

Russia launched a renewed bid to capture the war-battered town last month and analysts suggest Moscow’s forces have made incremental gains.

Kremlin warns of tensions if Poland sends troops to Finnish-Russian border

Any decision by Finland to allow a “concentration” of troops on its border with Russia would be viewed by Moscow as a threat, the Kremlin has said, after Poland offered to send military advisers to help Helsinki police the frontier.

The head of the Polish National Security Bureau, Jacek Siewiera, said that Poland would send military advisers to its Nato ally Finland, in response to “an official request for allied support in the face of a hybrid attack on the Finnish border”.

“A team of military advisers will provide on-site knowledge on border security, also in operational terms,” he said.

Finland said on Wednesday it was unaware of the Polish offer. It has closed its entire 1,340 km border with Russia for two weeks in a bid to halt an unusually large flow of asylum seekers that Helsinki says amounts to a “hybrid attack” orchestrated by Moscow, a charge the Kremlin denies.

Asked about the Polish offer to Finland, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “This is an absolutely redundant measure to ensure border security because there is no threat there.”

Truck blockade at Polish-Ukrainian border 'unacceptable,' says EU official

Ukraine and the European Union cannot be “taken hostage” by Polish truckers blockading the Polish-Ukrainian border in protest at competition from Ukrainian hauliers, the European Commissioner for Transport said on Wednesday.

The round-the-clock blockade in Medyka and three other border crossings, which started on Monday, extends a protest that has left over a thousand lorries stranded for days in queues that stretch for miles.

Transport commissioner Adina Valean said the situation was “unacceptable”.

Polish truckers complain they are losing out to Ukrainian companies which offer cheaper prices for their services and which are transporting goods within the EU, rather than just between the bloc and Ukraine.

“There is no good faith in finding a solution... and there is nearly a complete lack of involvement from Polish authorities... who are supposed to enforce the law at that border,” Valean said.

“While I support the people’s right to protest, the entire EU, not to mention Ukraine, a country currently at war, cannot be taken hostage by blocking our external borders.”

'No sense of fatigue' when it comes to support for Ukraine, Blinken says

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that there was “no sense of fatigue” among Nato allies when it came to helping Ukraine.

“Some are questioning whether the United States and other Nato allies in truth continue to stand with Ukraine as we enter the second winter of (Vladimir) Putin’s brutality,” Mr Blinken said.

“But the answer here today at Nato is clear and it’s unwavering. We must and we will continue to support Ukraine.”

Russia claims it has 'taken control' of village on outskirts of Bakhmut

Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of a village in eastern Ukraine’s war-torn Donetsk region.

Khromove, which Russia calls Artyomovskoe, is on the western outskirts of Bakhmut, a city which Russia captured last summer after a months-long battle.

Reuters could not independently verify the defence ministry’s assertion and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine.

Pictured: Ukrainian soldiers fire artillery at their fighting position in the direction of Avdiivka

A Ukrainian drone was shot down over Moscow, Russia has claimed.

Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of the capital, said Russian air defence forces destroyed a Ukraine-launched drone over the Podolsk district in the region of Moscow.

“According to preliminary information, there was no damage or casualties at the site where the debris fell,” he said.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s air force said it destroyed 21 drones and two missiles launched by Russia overnight.

Russia has amassed large missile stockpile ahead of winter, says Nato Secretary General

Russia has amassed a large missile stockpile ahead of winter, Nato’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said.

Russia has been making new attempts to strike Ukraine’s power grid and energy infrastructure, “trying to leave Ukraine in the dark and cold,” he said.

It comes after German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called on Ukraine’s supporters to create a winter shield over the country to protect it from Russian attacks.

'There is no stalemate,' says Ukraine's foreign minister

Ukraine’s foreign minister has denied that there is a stalemate in its war with Russia.

Dmytro Kuleba rejected a journalist’s assertion that the war was now at a stalemate, after Ukraine’s summer counter-offensive failed to win back significant amounts of territory occupied by Russia.

“There is no stalemate,” he said before moving on to another question.

Speaking to reporters on the event’s sidelines, he called for greater alignment of Ukraine’s and Nato’s defence industries to ensure Kyiv has the supplies it needs to defeat Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

Turkey has told Sweden it expects to ratify its long-delayed accession to the Nato military alliance within weeks, Sweden’s foreign minister said on Wednesday.

“I had a bilateral with my colleague, the (Turkish) foreign minister ... where he told me that he expected the ratification to take place within weeks,” Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom told reporters before the second day of a meeting of Nato foreign ministers.

Turkey and Hungary are the only Nato members yet to ratify Sweden’s bid, more than 18 months after it applied for membership.

Some in Nato had hoped Sweden’s ratification would be completed by now, in time for an accession ceremony to take place on the sidelines of the Brussels meeting.

Ukraine tells Nato it won't 'back down' in fight against Russia

Ukraine’s foreign minister said that it won’t “back down” in its fight against Russia, despite doubts over US support and minimal progress on the front line.

“We have to continue, we have to keep fighting. Ukraine is not going to back down,” Dmytro Kuleba told Kyiv’s Nato backers in Brussels.

“Our strategic goal, which is territorial integrity within internationally recognised borders as of 1991, remains unchanged,” he said.

“The issue here is not just Ukraine’s security it is the security and safety of the entire Euro-Atlantic space.”

The European Union has delivered about 300,000 of its promised million shells to Ukraine so far, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Wednesday while visiting a Nato event in Brussels.

Speaking to reporters on the event’s sidelines, Mr Kuleba called for greater alignment of Ukraine’s and Nato’s defence industries to ensure Kyiv has the supplies it needs to defeat Russia.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called on Ukraine’s supporters to create a winter shield over the country to protect it from Russian attacks.

“Russia again is aiming at civil infrastructure”, Ms Baerbock told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels.

Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure last winter left millions in the cold and dark for extended periods.

Ukraine said it believed Russia had poisoned the wife of its military intelligence chief, in an apparent assassination attempt targeting the heart of Kyiv’s leadership.

Marianna Budanova, who is an advisor to Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko, was hospitalised after a prolonged deterioration in her health, the Babel news outlet reported on Tuesday.

Ukrainian investigators’ “main hypothesis” is that Russia was involved in the poisoning attempt, Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov later told AFP.

“The target was the wife,” he added, because “it is simply impossible to reach the commander directly.”

There were no immediate comments from Russian authorities.

Putin won't 'make peace in Ukraine' before 2024 US election, says US offiicial

Russian President Vladimir Putin will not make peace in Ukraine before he knows the results of the November 2024 US election, a senior US State Department official said on Tuesday.

It comes amid concerns that a potential victory for former President Donald Trump could upend Western support for Kyiv.

Mr Trump, who is seeking reelection in 2024 and is the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has been sharply critical of US support for Kyiv.

A senior official briefing reporters after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels said the alliance reiterated its support for Ukraine knowing that a peace agreement in the next year is unlikely.

“My expectation is that Putin won’t make a peace or a meaningful peace before he sees the result of our election,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the outcomes of the meeting.

Asked whether they were expressing a personal opinion or the view of the US government, the official said it was a “widely shared premise.”

“That was the context in which the allies all expressed strong support for Ukraine” in the Nato meeting on Tuesday, the official added, without mentioning Mr Trump by name or explicitly saying how the election result would affect support for Ukraine.

1143249491,20231129,"Russia is building nuclear installations in several countries presently torn by Islamic jihadism, raising growing concern in the international community.

A few weeks ago, while eyes were focused on the horrors unfolding in the Middle East, a stroke of a pen in a tiny country in West Africa made the world a more dangerous place.

Simon-Pierre Boussim, Burkina Faso’s energy minister, and Nikolay Spasskiy, deputy director-general of the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom, signed a deal to build a nuclear power plant in the landlocked Sahel desert state.

Russia’s national security establishment views civil nuclear power exports as an “important tool for projecting influence overseas while creating revenue streams for sustaining intellectual and technical capabilities and vital programs inside Russia itself,” according to research by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

However, such cooperation is often a double-edged sword.

At a ceremony to announce the Burkina Faso deal, Mr. Boussim thanked Moscow for its “willingness to provide Burkina Faso with its future energy needs.”

What will Russia get in exchange for its “philanthropy?”

Here’s a clue: Mr. Boussim is also Burkina Faso’s minister of mines. The country’s main mineral resource is gold. It’s Africa’s fourth-largest largest, yielding almost 60 metric tons in 2022, according to state statistics.

The Russian mining company Nordgold owns several of the nation’s major gold mines, along with China.

Russia has for years used mercenaries from the Wagner Group to seize control of gold mines and oil fields in Central, West, and North Africa. It began increasing its “security” presence significantly in Africa in 2019, shortly after Wagner's leader at the time, Yevgeny Prigozhin, posted an internal memo that read: “Africa is a region of the world where the interests of all global powers converge.

In December 2022, Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said Burkina Faso’s junta, which seized power in a coup that September, had hired Wagner to help it fight “armed non-state actors.”

“I believe a mine in southern Burkina has been allocated to them as a form of payment for their services,” he told reporters at the United States–Africa summit.

While Burkina Faso has rejected that claim, the government hasn't confirmed or denied that it has entered an agreement with Wagner.

If Wagner's guns-for-hire follow Russian nuclear experts into Burkina Faso, the country of 20 million will present them with a stiffer challenge, according to security analysts.

More than 40 percent of the country is presently controlled by an al-Qaeda offshoot, Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), with the help of a local group affiliated with the ISIS terror group, the analysts told The Epoch Times.

“I don’t think it’s a very good idea to build a high-security nuclear plant in a place where Islamic jihadists are currently running amok,” said Babacar Ndiaye, an independent West African security analyst who's based in Dakar, Senegal.

In fact, during the Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg in July, he made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin for the nuclear project.

After he took power, Capt. Traore made immediate moves to replace France, the nation's closest Western ally and his country’s former colonial overlord, with Russia.

Burkina Faso’s equally mineral-rich neighbors, Mali and Niger, which are also strengthening ties with Russia particularly on military cooperation, are struggling to contain Islamist insurgencies linked to al-Qaeda and ISIS.

Wagner fighters are present in both Mali and Niger.

The military government in Mali, which is Africa’s third-largest signed an agreement with Russia that includes a gold refinery project in the capital, Bamako.

Finance Minister Alousseni Sanou said the refinery would process 200 metric tons of gold annually.

On the same day, Burkina Faso's government began construction of the country's first gold refinery. Its co-managing company, Marena Gold, expects the production capacity to be about 880 pounds of gold per day.

Mr. Traore said the gold would be under the “full control” of Burkina Faso.

“For some time now, gold has been [Burkina's] leading export product,"" he stated at the launch ceremony in Ouagadougou. ""But we have no control over gold ... today, we have decided to put a whole network in place.”

Niger, another strong Russian ally, is one of the world’s top producers of uranium.

In a recent address to the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) in Washington, Mr. Akufo-Addo suggested that the United States isn’t paying enough attention to an area he called the “Burkina corridor.”

He said the failure of the junta in Ouagadougou to control its territory has created an “open door” for terrorists to move into four countries to the south: Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Togo.

Mr. Ndiaye said the militants had already launched “serious attacks” in Benin and Togo.

In response, the four nations created the Accra Initiative, a cooperative and collaborative security mechanism. It has three pillars, he said: information and intelligence sharing; training of security and intelligence personnel; and conducting joint cross-border military operations to sustain border security.

Mr. Akufo-Addo told the USIP he was in Washington to seek U.S. support for the initiative’s core mission:

“To close the Burkina corridor,” although not with the help of American “boots on the ground.”

“The terrorist groups,” he added, “are evolving by the day as they scramble to control more territories and natural resources following defeats suffered in other parts of the world.”

He said the jihadists have provided coup leaders, in cooperation with Russia, with the “perfect excuse” to seize and hold on to power.

Mr. Akufo-Addo said Wagner mercenaries were helping local militias fight the terrorists—not for peace, but to regain control of mines.

He pointed out that the United States, the UK, and the European Union have provided $188 billion in aid to Ukraine since February 2022, while total security assistance for coastal West Africa for the same period has totaled $29.6 million.

“We are virtually out of time to work together to repair multilateralism,"" he added. ""If we do not renew our commitments to build, keep, and consolidate peace and democracy all over the world, we will have to brace ourselves to live in a new and more dangerous world.”

Mr. Ndiaye noted that President Joe Biden “made no mention of Africa” in his Oct. 20 Oval Office address, when he announced that he’d ask Congress for $61 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, and $2 billion for the Indo-Pacific region.

“When he was in Washington, President Akufo-Addo was making the point that the democracies of West Africa are part of the same global struggle against the evils of terrorism and dictatorship that President Joe Biden speaks about when referring to Israel and Ukraine,” Mr. Ndiaye said.

“Russia is starting to dominate the Sahel region. Whether the entire West Africa falls into the hands of Russia, or the terrorists, or both, it’s equally bad for the whole world because both groups will have control of immense wealth they will use to spread their evil and they will ultimately use that evil against America and its allies.”

Moscow’s move into Burkina Faso isn’t its first attempt to gain a nuclear foothold in Africa and it won’t be the last, Mr. Ndiaye says.

South Africa is currently the only African state that produces nuclear power commercially, but more nations on the continent that are the least electrified globally are moving in the same direction.

In 2017, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Russia's Mr. Putin signed a deal for Rosatom to build a $30 billion nuclear power plant at El Dabaa, about 280 miles northwest of Cairo. The plant is expected to begin producing electricity in 2026.

The same year, Russia also signed a deal to build several nuclear power stations in Nigeria, but those projects haven't begun yet.

Kenya also has announced plans to build its first nuclear power plant by 2027 but hasn't decided on an international partner.

In September, Rwanda—a Western ally in Africa—announced that the Canadian-German company Dual Fluid Energy would build a nuclear reactor in the country by 2028.

“All these nuclear projects in Africa are great for Russia, but there’s one jewel that Putin really wants in his nuclear crown” on the continent, Johannesburg-based energy analyst Chris Yelland said. That would be Africa’s most industrialized and technologically rich country, South Africa, he added.

It isn't as if the Russian leader hasn’t tried to fill that gap.

In 2014, then-President Jacob Zuma, a former African National Congress (ANC) intelligence chief with wide-ranging Soviet-era contacts, signed a secret deal with Rosatom for the firm to build nuclear reactors in Africa’s second-largest economy.

If it had gone through, the $76 billion agreement would have been the biggest procurement contract ever signed in South Africa, and would have locked the nation into economic and energy dependency on Russia for decades, economists said.

Treasury and Finance Ministry officials, the media, civil society groups, and court rulings from a South African judiciary that remains largely free of political interference, blocked the deal from reaching fruition.

But top ANC members, including Energy and Mines Minister Gwede Mantashe and President Cyril Ramaphosa, remain dedicated to future nuclear projects in South Africa, with Rosatom their partner of choice."
1143249494,20231129,"SAS’s €833 Million Recapitalization Gets EU Nod at Second Try

(Bloomberg) -- SAS AB’s €833 million ($915 million) Danish and Swedish recapitalization was approved by European Union state-aid watchdogs, in a revised decision after an earlier approval was struck down by an EU court.

The European Commission said Wednesday that the support package complies with its rules on state support under the bloc’s emergency framework to help firms that suffered during the pandemic.

It added that the a mechanism proposed by SAS to increase the remuneration of Denmark and Sweden and incentivize their exit from the aid addresses concerns raised by the EU’s General Court.

Judges had taken a hard line of other EU state aid packages in the airlines industry — including striking down the EU’s approval of a €6 billion aid deal for the German flag carrier Deutsche Lufthansa AG.

SAS operates across Denmark, Sweden and Norway. In 2020, it was at risk of default and insolvency due to the coronavirus pandemic and the travel restrictions in place to limit the spread of the virus, prompting Danish and Swedish government to offer the airline support.

SAS said in a statement that it’ll hold an extraordinary general meeting in January to seek approval for the so-called “step-up mechanism” the EU said is required for the countries’ share investments."

1143264104,20231129,"European Union (EU) ambassador to Namibia Ana Beatriz Martins has commended Namibia’s ambition of green industrialisation.

Martins says the parallel strategy to explore oil and green energy is an understandable economic and energy choice.

“It is a legitimate and sovereign decision of Namibia to also seek economic opportunities from the fossil fuels that are there,” she said yesterday.

Namibia aims to utilise its oil wealth to seek economic development and prepare for a renewable energy transition as it lays the foundation for the green hydrogen industry.

President Hage Geingob on Monday said the country will not overlook its oil resources as it strives for green hydrogen.

“There is no contradiction; we can get oil now. It will be our immediate source for the next 10 years.

But green hydrogen is a future, long-term climate mitigation source that the world is looking to, and that Namibia is leading. We should be proud of that,” he said.

The EU and Namibia have a green transition partnership solidified through the strategic partnership on critical raw materials and green hydrogen.

This partnership was initiated in November last year through the signing of an agreement.

“We work on the green transition part with Namibia, because this is where we share the common commitment and common concern.

Something needs to be done on the increasing temperatures and climate change,” Martins said.

This partnership hinges on two parties’ different but complementary priorities, she said.

Namibia aims to export green hydrogen and transition into green industrialisation and to achieve economic growth, job creation, and development through greater access to energy and water, she said.

The EU needs to secure alternative and cleaner energy sources by importing renewable hydrogen from competitive standards.

Speaking on fossil fuels in Europe, Martins said the region is currently dependent on fossil fuels, but has also developed a strategy to achieve a carbon neutral economy by 2050.

This carbon-neutrality strategy comprises the ‘Green Deal’ and the ‘Fit for 55’ package.

The package involves regulatory frameworks designed to reduce the EU’s net emissions by at least 55% by 2030.

These regulations include an emissions-trading system and a carbon-border adjustment mechanism.

Green hydrogen commissioner James Mnyupe said the green industrialisation agenda is already materialising and that Namibians should be excited.

“The green hydrogen programme, working together with the town of Lüderitz and the town council there, has started engaging experts to help think about the requisite town transformation that would be needed to house these industries,” he said.

He highlighted the use of critical raw minerals like neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium, which Namibia has discovered in abundance.

Mnyupe said Andrada Mining is making progress in processing lithium.

He was speaking at a press briefing at State House in Windhoek on Monday."

1143293395,20231129,"In a diplomatic and democratic convergence, the European Union Election Expert Mission touched down in Dhaka, Bangladesh, today, marking a watershed moment in the trajectory leading to the country’s upcoming parliamentary polls. Comprising seasoned election experts, this delegation arrives with a multifaceted mission: to meticulously assess and actively support the electoral process, with a primary emphasis on ensuring transparency, fairness, and the strict adherence to democratic principles. The unfolding collaboration between the European Union (EU) and Bangladesh in this electoral venture signifies not only a diplomatic engagement but also a shared commitment to upholding the democratic ethos that forms the bedrock of both entities.

The day unfolded with a critical milestone as the European Union Heads of Mission engaged in an extensive and substantive discussion with Bangladesh’s Chief Election Commissioner, Kazi Habibul Awal. This high-level exchange aimed to delve into a myriad of topics crucial to the forthcoming parliamentary elections, placing significant emphasis on the necessity of a free, fair, and inclusive electoral process.

The dialogue spanned various aspects, encompassing the minutiae of electoral preparations, the efficacy of voter registration procedures, the dynamics of election campaigns, and the pivotal role played by independent observers in ensuring the sanctity of the electoral process. The European Union experts sought not only a broad understanding but also nuanced insights into the proactive measures undertaken by Bangladesh’s election authorities to ensure the unblemished integrity of the electoral process, as well as the comprehensive inclusion of all eligible voters.

Throughout the exchange, two overarching themes emerged as central tenets: transparency and inclusivity. The European Union delegation underscored the profound significance of open communication channels, emphasizing the need to provide citizens with unfettered access to information regarding the electoral process. A transparent electoral process not only fosters public trust but also allows citizens to make informed decisions, thereby bolstering the very foundation of democratic governance.

Furthermore, the experts stressed the importance of cultivating an inclusive environment that encourages participation from all segments of society. Inclusivity in the electoral process is not merely a procedural necessity but a fundamental democratic principle. A truly representative democracy is one that reflects the diversity and plurality of its citizenry. The dialogue, therefore, aimed at understanding the measures in place to ensure that all eligible voters, regardless of demographic or socio-economic background, have equal access to the electoral process.

Beyond the immediate discussions on electoral preparations, the meeting also delved into the realm of capacity building. The European Union experts expressed their unwavering commitment to supporting Bangladesh in enhancing its electoral infrastructure and mechanisms. Capacity building is not just a technical enhancement but a collaborative exchange of best practices and experiences that contributes to the overall improvement of Bangladesh’s electoral system.

This exchange of expertise is envisioned to bring the electoral processes of Bangladesh more in line with international standards. The collaboration acknowledges that the strength of democratic institutions is contingent on their ability to adapt and evolve, incorporating the best practices from around the world. A robust electoral system, fortified through collaborative efforts, serves as the cornerstone of a resilient democracy.

In the spirit of openness and mutual respect, the European Union Heads of Mission acknowledged the challenges inherent in organizing and conducting free and fair elections. The Bangladesh Chief Election Commissioner, in turn, provided insights into the nuanced landscape within which the electoral process operates. This frank exchange of challenges and potential solutions fosters a collaborative spirit, emphasizing that the success of an electoral process is not only in its seamless execution but in the ability to navigate and overcome challenges as they arise.

The collaborative approach extends beyond the immediate electoral process. It involves a commitment to continuous dialogue and problem-solving, recognizing that the democratic journey is an ongoing process of improvement and adaptation. The EU experts conveyed their willingness to engage in sustained efforts with Bangladeshi authorities, not only during the preparatory phase but also in addressing any challenges that may arise during the actual conduct of the elections.

The discussions also touched upon the broader context of international standards in electoral processes. The European Union, as a proponent of democratic values worldwide, emphasized the importance of ensuring that Bangladesh’s electoral processes align with internationally recognized standards. This alignment is not merely a matter of compliance but a shared responsibility to uphold the universal principles that underpin democracy.

The EU Heads of Mission reiterated their commitment to working closely with Bangladeshi authorities, offering both technical assistance and diplomatic support to ensure that the upcoming parliamentary elections are conducted in a manner that not only meets national expectations but also resonates with international benchmarks. This collaborative approach is grounded in the understanding that the success of one nation’s democracy contributes to the broader tapestry of democratic governance globally.

Beyond the technical aspects of electoral processes, the dialogue extended to the role of civil society and media in fostering a vibrant democratic landscape. The European Union experts sought to understand the dynamics of civil society engagement and the media’s role in disseminating information, ensuring accountability, and facilitating an informed electorate.

The engagement with civil society and media is integral to the broader democratic ecosystem. Civil society organizations serve as watchdogs, advocating for transparency and accountability, and contributing to the overall health of democracy. The media, as the fourth estate, plays a crucial role in informing citizens, providing a platform for diverse voices, and holding institutions accountable. The discussions, therefore, explored the measures in place to safeguard the autonomy and effectiveness of these pillars of democracy.

The dialogue also delved into the role of international observers in the electoral process. The European Union, known for its commitment to deploying observer missions in various parts of the world, emphasized the importance of their role in reinforcing the credibility of the electoral process.

International observers bring an impartial perspective, offering an external validation of the fairness and transparency of elections. The presence of such missions not only bolsters public confidence but also signals to the international community the commitment of a nation to democratic principles. The discussions, therefore, explored the extent to which Bangladesh welcomes and facilitates the work of international observers, ensuring their unimpeded access and ability to assess the electoral process comprehensively.

The arrival of the European Union Election Expert Mission in Dhaka and the subsequent comprehensive exchange with Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal signify a robust commitment to collaborative diplomacy and the shared pursuit of democratic excellence. The discussions encapsulated a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from technical electoral preparations to the overarching principles of transparency, inclusivity, and adherence to international standards.

The collaborative synergy between Bangladesh and the European Union is poised to play a pivotal role in ensuring the success of the upcoming parliamentary elections. Beyond the immediate electoral process, this collaboration reflects a shared commitment to the ongoing journey of democratic governance. The strength of democracy lies not only in the conduct of elections but in the continuous adaptation and improvement of democratic institutions, informed by international best practices and a commitment to universal democratic values.

As the European Union and Bangladesh embark on this collaborative journey, the world watches with keen interest, recognizing that the success of one democratic experiment contributes to the global tapestry of democratic governance. In an era where democratic values face diverse challenges, this collaborative engagement serves as a beacon, illuminating the path toward resilient, inclusive, and people-centric democracies."

1143308441,20231129,"The U.S. and its allies are seeking simultaneously to keep the OSCE alive and hold Russia to account for its invasion of Ukraine. They are attending while making a point of denouncing Moscow’s actions – a stance that some of Ukraine’s closest allies have little truck with.

The 57-member OSCE is the successor to a Cold War-era organisation for Soviet and Western powers to engage but is now largely paralysed by Russia’s ongoing use of the effective veto each country has.

By Andrew Gray, Francois Murphy and Ingrid Melander BRUSSELS/VIENNA (Reuters) -Member countries are divided over the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s annual foreign ministers’ meeting on Thursday with Baltic nations and Ukraine refusing to attend over the presence of Russia’s Sergei Lavrov.

“How can you talk with an aggressor who is committing genocide, full aggression against another member state, Ukraine?” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told reporters on Wednesday in Brussels where he attended a NATO meeting.

Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia are siding with Ukraine on the issue.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said he understood unease about Lavrov attending the meeting in Skopje, North Macedonia. But he said it was a chance for Lavrov to hear broad condemnation of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“Your decision to allow Lavrov to participate is in line with our common objective to keep multilateralism alive,” Borrell told North Macedonia’s Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski at a joint press conference in Skopje.

“Lavrov needs to hear again, from everyone, why Russia is being condemned and isolated,” Borrell said. “Then he will be able to come back to the Kremlin and report to the Kremlin master.”

Estonia had been due to take over the annually rotating OSCE chairmanship but Russia blocked it for months. A last-minute deal for neutral Malta to take over the chairmanship must be formally approved at the meeting on Thursday and Friday.

The OSCE issue reflects broader diplomatic questions about Ukraine. While only Belarus regularly sides with Russia at OSCE meetings, this week’s absentees worry that Western powers’ commitment to Ukraine is wavering.

The United States has been at pains to reassure them while arguing that the OSCE, which upholds standards that Russia has agreed to, is the right place to hold Moscow to account.

“First of all … we have no planned interactions with Russia. We will also not accept any return to business as usual in the midst of this aggression, which has resulted in the largest land war on the European continent since World War Two,” U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter told reporters.

“A lot has been done to expose Russian atrocities, and I expect that that will be the theme, of condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, in all its forms.”

It later became clear, however, that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would only attend meetings with his counterpart from North Macedonia and other like-minded countries on Wednesday then leave before the Ministerial Council formally begins on Thursday.

The OSCE is not the only international body where the West and Russia meet. Lavrov still attends Group of 20 events around the world and the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

In terms of substance, the stakes in Skopje are low. With the chairmanship settled, the main open issue is whether four top OSCE officials, including Secretary-General Helga Schmid, will have their terms extended.

The absentee countries, however, fear that Lavrov will use the meeting as a platform. “It just so happens that the aggressor country is having a veto, and in a sense trying to hijack the agenda of the OSCE. I think that is simply wrong,” said Latvian Foreign Minister Krisjanis Karins.

1143312957,20231129,"The EU is ""very concerned"" that Niger's military leaders revoked an EU-backed law criminalizing migration. But residents of Niger's ancient crossroad town of Agadez are overjoyed about the move.

""We are overjoyed that this law has been repealed,"" said Bakray, a resident of Agadez, a historical trade hub on the fringes of the Sahara Desert in central Niger that has long been a crossroads connecting West Africa to the vast Sahel region, North Africa and the Middle East.

On the weekend, Niger's military junta signed an order revoking a law to curb the smuggling of migrants from West Africa heading north toward Europe. The law was enacted in 2015, under heavy pressure from the EU, at the height of the European migrant crisis.

Known as Law 2015-36, the legislation controversially made it illegal for migrants to travel from Agadez towards Niger's northern border. It also criminalized the work of the local ""ferrymen"" who transported these migrants towards Libya and Algeria.

Niger, the third poorest country in the world, received €1.2 billion ($1.32 billion) from the European Union between 2014 and 2020 in development aid, which many saw as coupled to the passage of Law 2015-36.

""It's not a Nigerien law,"" said Bakray. ""It's not a law that really harmonizes with our mores and customs because it was imposed on us. It meant we couldn't welcome people with a full heart.""

The number of migrants transiting through Niger and onto Europe dropped sharply over the years because of the law. But it attracted criticism from many quarters, from locals in the Agadez region to international migrant organizations.

The law disrupted many livelihoods dependent on the migrants in a region suffering from a drastic economic decline in the decade before its introduction. Migration provided ""an economic buffer"" found a study by the Centre for Africa-Europe relations (ECDMP), noting that one-third of respondents in Agadez had earned some form of income from the migration industry.

Another study found that in 2016, before Niger's government started enacting the law, as many as 333,000 people transited through Agadez, bringing in as much as $100 million, which helped stabilize the regional economy.

""When you travel around Agadez today, you can see the joy because it was an unpopular law,"" Salifou Manzo, a prominent civil society member in Agadez, told DW. ""Effectively, it prohibited any activity linked to migration — which ruined Agadez's economy and triggered many cases of drug abuse, theft and crimes.

""People are jubilant in Agadez because they know that this important income-generating activity is returning to the region.""

Those convicted under the law will be considered for release, according to the military junta, something Manzo highlighted as an important move.

""Everyone who contravened the 2015-36 law, who were imprisoned, they're exonerated, they are free,"" he told DW.

The anti-smuggling law was also criticized for prioritizing border protection over the protection of people on the move. It forced migrants to take more dangerous routes.

Alarmphone Sahara, which provides a telephone hotline for migrants in distress, was one migrant organization that welcomed the repeal of Law 2015-36. It posted on X, formerly Twitter, that it was ""good news.""

Souley Oumarou, the coordinator of the Forum for Responsible Citizenship (FCR) in Agadez, also welcomed the end of the law as it hindered the rights of West Africans to move freely across the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) region.

""These rights to emigrate, to travel, to go to any destination they please ... have been restored through the repeal of this law,"" he told DW, ""and for us, this is a good thing.""

As for the European Union, it warned that the law's repeal could lead to an influx of migrants into Europe.

""That will also probably mean more people coming to Libya for example and maybe trying to cross the Mediterranean to the EU,"" EU home affairs chief Ylva Johansson said on Tuesday. ""I very much regret this decision and I am very concerned about the consequences.""

Since the EU suspended aid to Niger after a military coup deposed President Mohamed Bazoum in July, tensions have been high between the European bloc and the ruling junta.

The repeal is seen as the junta's effort to regain local support and also to retaliate against the EU.

""The edict is part of a reprisal against this EU's decision,"" said Souley Oumarou, ""with the aim of hurting Europe by allowing Africans to immigrate by sea to Europe.

""But for us, it's a restoration of violated rights,"" he said. ""It gives the right to a certain number of operators who handle migrant transactions to exercise their profession and … it restores the right for Africans to emigrate, to travel, to go to any destination they please."""

1143319946,20231129,"La Unión/Osicala, El Salvador, Nov 29 (EFE).- Collaboration among various non-governmental organizations is essential in providing humanitarian assistance to migrants transiting through El Salvador, primarily heading towards the United States, as part of their journey to the northern continent.

A significant initiative in El Salvador includes a project driven by Oxfam and funded by the European Union’s General Directorate for Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO). Non-governmental entities PROVIDA and Fundación Campo are also involved in this effort.

This project offers humanitarian assistance and gathers information on migration flows stored in the Forced Migration Observatory. The data aims to strengthen and empower all networks, agencies, and organizations involved in the response, care, and protection mechanism.

Gersón Ramírez, a young member of Fundación Campo, was part of a four-person team that interviewed transiting migrants to understand their migration motives.

“We managed to identify a considerable influx of migrants from South and Central America,” Ramírez told EFE. This migration is driven by poverty, inequality, political situations in their countries, and crime.

In 2023, more than 6,400 transiting or returned migrants have been registered at monitoring points in El Salvador, according to the Forced Migration Observatory data.

In La Unión department, approximately 207 kilometers from San Salvador, a dock serves as a landing point for boats, primarily carrying Nicaraguans and Hondurans. These migrants often stock up on food and other supplies on Salvadoran soil before returning to their countries.

However, these boats are also used by nationals of neighboring countries on their migratory journey northward.

Melvin, a boat operator with about nine years of experience, shared with EFE that some of these citizens opt for temporary jobs in La Unión to “save a couple of bucks” before continuing their journey.

Sometimes, he also transports migrants in his boat, then takes them to a bus terminal to “continue their journey.”

Some migrants receive medical assistance, food, and accommodation at the Migrant Persons Attention Center in La Unión, a “space of hope” with a capacity for about 250 people.

Karla Portillo, the center’s administrator, explained to EFE that the center “operates based on a network with which we work together and for the benefit of migrants, in conjunction with the municipality and with the support of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and cooperators.”

The Right to Migrate

The El Amatillo border, located in the Pasaquina municipality in La Unión, connects El Salvador with Honduras. It is a common route used by Central American migrants, especially Nicaraguans and Hondurans.

Prudencio Ramírez, from the National Civil Police (PNC), told EFE that “everyone has the right to migrate,” but “many of them make wrong decisions, leading to regrettable situations,” he said.

The passage through this area for Central Americans is completely free, he explains, “as they can cross just with their passport or identity document.” However, he noted that Colombian or Venezuelan migrants “choose blind spots to avoid crossing the border because they lack legal documentation.”

The Police’s role at this border “is not to detain any migrant,” but “when we identify someone directing them, especially in large groups, we proceed (to apprehend) for possible human trafficking, activating a protocol to provide humanitarian assistance,” he warns."

Stupidly quick from a dig for a vehicle this heavy, the swoopy crossover doesn't hold a candle to the Tesla Model X Plaid on the drag strip.

Filmed at the Bradenton Motorsports Park in Florida by Brooks Weisblat of DragTimes, the go-faster sport utility vehicles clock 119.11 miles per hour and 141.85 miles per hour first time out on the strip. In metric, that would be 191.68 and 228.28 kilometers per hour. Care to guess which one required 9.8 seconds and which crossed the finish line in 11.5?Of course, Tesla's three-row crossover proved the quicker and faster of the two performance SUVs. In the second and final race, the owner of the Model X Plaid was joined by no fewer than five passengers to give the guy in the Cayenne a chance of winning.Spoiler alert: internal combustion enthusiasts will be disappointed once again. It's not the Porker's fault, though, but the cold and hard truth of electric muscle versus internal combustion in the quarter mile. With peak torque generated much quicker than a twin-turbo V8 gets into its sweet spot, the Tesla's three-motor powertrain is far superior in this scenario.There is, however, a drawback to going electric. 5,390 pounds (2,445 kilograms) of curb weight is obviously detrimental to the vehicle's handling. The Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT is a bit on the heavy side of SUVs as well at 5,055 pounds (2,293 kilograms), and it's not even the heaviest Cayenne of the lot.Unleashed in August 2023, the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid is a plug-in hybrid with a monstrous 729 horsepower and 700 pound-feet (950 Nm) on deck. Over in the United States, the German automaker lists a whopping 5,664 pounds (2,569 kilograms), meaning that it's heavier than the Model X Plaid.Slowly but surely, Porsche will electrify its production vehicles out of necessity rather than desire. The last model to switch to electric propulsion exclusively will be the 911, which is certain to survive the 2035 ban on the sale of new combustion-engined passenger vehicles in the European Union.How come? As it happens, the European Commission accepted to make an exception for certain internal combustion vehicles running on synthetic fuels rather than dinosaur juice. However, it remains to be seen how much a gallon of synthetic fuel will cost in 2035 compared to a gallon of gas.Regarding the Palo Alto-basedmanufacturer, did you hear that the Cybertruck is right around the corner? Deliveries kick off November 30, but alas, production output for the Cybertruck at Giga Texas will leave much to be desired in the first year or so."

1143342761,20231130,"A two-state solution would be the answer to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, officials of Arab states and the European Union agreed at a meeting in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday.

They said the Palestinian Authority, rather than Hamas, should rule Gaza.

European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said during the meeting in Barcelona that all EU members and almost everyone else attending agreed on the need for a two-state solution.

The Palestinian Authority must hold elections and improve its governance, but it is the only “viable solution” to the future leadership of Gaza to avoid a “power vacuum,” Borrell said.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the Palestinian people should decide who rules them and that any talk of administration of Gaza after the conflict should focus on the West Bank and Gaza as one entity.

A two-state solution envisages a state for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said the Palestinian Authority, which lost control of the Gaza Strip in a 2007 power struggle with Hamas, had no need to return to Gaza, adding, “We have been there all the time. We have 60,000 public workers there.”

The three officials spoke at the conclusion of a meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean, a 43-member grouping of European, North African and Middle Eastern countries.

Israel did not attend the summit. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan spoke as a representative of a group of ministers from the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

The original four-day truce between Israel and Hamas has been extended by 48 hours to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. This is the first lull in the seven weeks since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

In response to that attack, Israel bombarded the enclave and mounted a ground offensive in the north. Some 14,800 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza health authorities say, and hundreds of thousands displaced.__VOA News"

The 57-member OSCE is the successor to a Cold War-era organisation for Soviet and Western powers to engage but is now largely paralysed by Russia's ongoing use of the effective veto each country has.

The U.S. and its allies are seeking simultaneously to keep the OSCE alive and hold Russia to account for its invasion of Ukraine. They are attending while making a point of denouncing Moscow's actions - a stance that some of Ukraine's closest allies have little truck with.

""How can you talk with an aggressor who is committing genocide, full aggression against another member state, Ukraine?"" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told reporters on Wednesday in Brussels where he attended a NATO meeting.

Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia are siding with Ukraine on the issue. Russia's Tass news agency reported Lavrov arrived in Skopje on Wednesday after a circuitous five-hour flight that avoided the airspace of countries that have barred Russian aircraft.

The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said he understood unease about Lavrov attending the meeting in Skopje, North Macedonia. But he said it was a chance for Lavrov to hear broad condemnation of Russia's war in Ukraine.

""Your decision to allow Lavrov to participate is in line with our common objective to keep multilateralism alive,"" Borrell told North Macedonia's Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski at a joint press conference in Skopje.

""Lavrov needs to hear again, from everyone, why Russia is being condemned and isolated,"" Borrell said. ""Then he will be able to come back to the Kremlin and report to the Kremlin master.""

Estonia had been due to take over the annually rotating OSCE chairmanship but Russia blocked it for months. A last-minute deal for neutral Malta to take over the chairmanship must be formally approved at the meeting on Thursday and Friday.

The OSCE issue reflects broader diplomatic questions about Ukraine. While only Belarus regularly sides with Russia at OSCE meetings, this week's absentees worry that Western powers' commitment to Ukraine is wavering.

The United States has been at pains to reassure them while arguing that the OSCE, which upholds standards that Russia has agreed to, is the right place to hold Moscow to account.

""First of all ... we have no planned interactions with Russia. We will also not accept any return to business as usual in the midst of this aggression, which has resulted in the largest land war on the European continent since World War Two,"" U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter told reporters.

""A lot has been done to expose Russian atrocities, and I expect that that will be the theme, of condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine, in all its forms.""

It later became clear, however, that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would only attend meetings with his counterpart from North Macedonia and other like-minded countries on Wednesday then leave before the Ministerial Council formally begins on Thursday.

The OSCE is not the only international body where the West and Russia meet. Lavrov still attends Group of 20 events around the world and the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

In terms of substance, the stakes in Skopje are low. With the chairmanship settled, the main open issue is whether four top OSCE officials, including Secretary-General Helga Schmid, will have their terms extended.

The absentee countries, however, fear that Lavrov will use the meeting as a platform. ""It just so happens that the aggressor country is having a veto, and in a sense trying to hijack the agenda of the OSCE. I think that is simply wrong,"" said Latvian Foreign Minister Krisjanis Karins."

Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Armenia, Ambassador Vassilis Maragos, said this in an interview with Armenpress.

The Ambassador said that the EU will also consider further assistance to the forcibly displaced persons of Nagorno-Karabakh who’ve settled in Armenia after the Azerbaijani attack in September.

As for Armenia-EU bilateral relations, Ambassador Maragos said that the EU and Armenia are actively working together to predetermine future domains of their cooperation.

Below is an excerpt from the text of the aforesaid interview.

Mr. Ambassador, as you know, after the large-scale Azerbaijani military attack, Nagorno-Karabakh was depopulated, thousands of Armenians were forcibly displaced, leaving their homeland and place of birth. In essence, Azerbaijan implemented its policy of ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh. First of all, I would like to hear your opinion about this situation, about the behavior of Azerbaijan. Until this moment, we have heard condemning statements, but why does the EU not take active steps to impose sanctions on Azerbaijan?

Let me be clear, the European Union is committed to peace and stability in this region and we are investing important, high-level, political capital in this process. As you said, the European Union has made very clear its position against the use of force and in support of the human rights of Karabakh Armenians. As EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus Toivo Klaar gave extensive comments on the matter in his interview with Armenpress a couple of days ago, I would not make further comment on these issues.

Azerbaijan has violated the territorial integrity of Armenia, since May 2021, Azerbaijani forces have invaded the sovereign territory of Armenia in some parts. I would like to ask you again to present your position on this fact. How can the EU influence on the diplomatic level the restoration of territorial integrity of Armenia, how can the EU exert pressure on Azerbaijan regarding this issue and the return of Armenian prisoners illegally held in Azerbaijan?

The European Union, including through the EU Mission in Armenia and our contacts with both Yerevan and Baku, has a very clear understanding of the situation on the ground. We are also aware of the importance these issues have for Armenia and more broadly for peace and stability in the region, which is our primary aim. The EU has repeatedly called on the sides to ensure non-use of force and a distancing of forces to reduce tensions and potential escalation on the ground.

We have also called for all issues to be addressed peacefully in the framework of meetings of border delimitation commissions and the broader normalization process. We hope that some understanding can be reached in the near future on this and other issues, including during the next meeting of Armenia’s and Azerbaijan’s border commissions, now scheduled for 30 November 2023."

Hungary’s Orban says EU should first sign strategic partnership accord with Ukraine

The European Union should first sign a strategic partnership agreement with Ukraine instead of starting membership talks with the country, Hungary’s Viktor Orban said on Friday.

The 27 national EU leaders are due to decide in mid-December on whether to accept the European Commission’s recommendation to invite Kyiv to begin membership talks as soon as it meets final conditions, even as it fights to repel Russia’s invasion.

Any such decision requires unanimity of the bloc’s 27 members, with Hungary seen as the main potential obstacle. The Hungarian prime minister has repeatedly said Hungary would not support the Commission’s proposal in its present form.

Orban reiterated on Friday that several issues would need to be cleared before membership talks could start with Ukraine, saying the country, making it impossible to assess what consequences Ukraine’s membership would have on the bloc.

""If we don’t know (what consequences it would have) then we should not start talks... So I will represent the view that the EU should first sign a strategic partnership agreement with Ukraine,"" Orban said in an interview on state radio.

""This (agreement) could last for up to 5-10 years, let’s bring them closer, as the gap is too wide now,"" he said. ""Let’s give time for us to work together, and when we see that we can work together, then let’s bring up the issue of membership.""

US senators to be briefed on Ukraine aid on Tuesday

A classified briefing for all U.S. senators on Ukraine, Israel and elements of the national security supplemental funding package requested by President Joe Biden will be conducted on Tuesday 5 December, Senate aides said on Thursday.

The briefers will include Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General CQ Brown and US Agency for International Development Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman.

Biden asked Congress last month to approve $106 billion in national security funding, including aid for Ukraine as it battles a Russian invasion, support for Israel after the October 7 attacks by Hamas militants and money for additional security at the US border with Mexico.

But the funding has not been approved, raising concerns that funds for Ukraine in particular might never pass, particularly after the Republican-led House passed a bill including assistance for Israel, but not Ukraine.

In a speech via video link at the World Russian People’s Council in Moscow on Tuesday, Mr Putin said boosting the Russian population will be “our goal for the coming decades”.

“Many of our peoples maintain the tradition of the family, where four, five or more children are raised,” said Mr Putin. “Recall that in Russian families our grandmothers and great-grandmothers had both 7 and 8 children. Let us preserve and revive these traditions. Having many children, a large family, should become a norm, a way of life for all the peoples of Russia.”

The conference is led by the head of Russia’s Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, and was attended by representatives of other traditional religious organisations of Russia. Its theme was “The Present and Future of the Russian World”.

In November, the Ukrainian government said it had registered 3,574 Ukrainian military and 763 civilians taken into Russian or Moscow-backed separatists’ captivity since 2014.

The figure included those who have already returned to Ukraine, it said. However, it said the numbers did not show all the current prisoners.

Ukraine has already brought back 2,598 people from Russian captivity during 48 swaps, the Strategic Communications Department of the Armed Forces said on Tuesday.

Reuters could not independently verify the figures.

Ukraine says Russia to blame for months of no prisoner swaps

Ukraine‘s human rights commissioner accused Russia on Thursday of refusing to agree new exchanges of prisoners of war after a stretch of three months in which no swaps have been reported.

Kyiv and Moscow have held many prisoner swaps since the early months of Russia’s invasion in February 2022. But their intensity dropped in 2023 and the last one took place in early August.

“Exchanges don’t happen because Russia doesn’t want them to,” said Dmytro Lubinets, the human rights ombudsman who has regularly had a role in prisoner exchanges in the past.

“All the initiatives, desires and actions of Ukraine regarding the return of our defenders from captivity are met by a Russian unwillingness to return its citizens,” he said on Telegram messenger.

He added that Russian prisoners held in Ukraine had expressed a wish to be exchanged.

“No one from the Russian side wants to take them back,” he said.

The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Paul Whelan, a former US Marine currently being detained in Russia on a 16-year sentence for espionage, was reportedly attacked in a penal colony by another inmate on Tuesday afternoon.

The incident happened while Mr Whelan was working at a sewing table at around 1.30pm, his brother, David Whelan, said in an emailed statement provided to The Independent.

Paul Whelan had asked a new prisoner to move because he was blocking part of the production line he was working on. After several requests, the prisoner did not budge but instead allegedly hit Mr Whelan in the face, breaking his glasses.

The prisoner reportedly then tried to strike the American a second time, but he blocked the attempt.

Other prisoners intervened to stop the attack from continuing, the statement said. Paul Whelan later reported the attack to prison camp’s deputy warden. It is now being investigated by the prosecutor’s office.

“All of you feel that the Russian presence on our land is not permanent. I know this. Ukraine will reclaim its territory and its people. We will not leave anyone to the occupiers.

“Ukraine will soon have fire control capabilities over Russian-occupied Crimea,” Zelensky said.

The Federal Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, had a phone call with President Zelensky on Thursday in which they discussed “further defence cooperation”.

In a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, Zelensky emphasised the importance of “ensuring unity within the European Union in the issue of endorsement of Ukraine’s accession negotiations and in the allocation of €50 billion in aid for the coming years.”

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and President Zelensky spoke on Thursday about their continuing political relations amid the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

In a statement on X, formelry known as Twitter, he said:

“I spoke with Rishi Sunak to thank him for the UK’s continued defense and political support. Following my visits to the frontlines, I briefed the Prime Minister on Ukraine’s priority defense needs for strengthening our warriors and our sky shield.

“We discussed further macro-financial support for Ukraine and coordinated steps in the run-up to important international events.

“We specifically addressed Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration, highlighted the significance of the October Peace Formula talks in Malta, and discussed further steps to put the Formula into action.”

In a statement on their website, the Slovakia government said:

“Today, Thursday, November 30, 2023, the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Robert Fico, received the Ambassador of the United States of America to the Slovak Republic, Gautam Rana, and the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Slovak Republic, Igor BratÄikov, at the Slovak Government Office in Bratislava.‘I presented them with my view on the development of Slovak-American and Slovak-Russian relations. The Slovak Republic is a member state of the EU and NATO, which naturally affects our foreign policy priorities. On the other hand, it cannot limit us in sovereign positions, which are not always in line with the policy of one single correct opinion promoted in the European Union. The priority of the foreign policy that I intend to implement is the protection and promotion of Slovak national-state interests, which include the support of peace initiatives and not war in Ukraine,’ said the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister explained Slovak national priorities to both ambassadors, as well as his view of the war in Ukraine, where the EU and US strategy set so far is clearly failing. ‘Slovakia also has an obligation to prepare for the period after the end of the war in Ukraine and for the standardization of Slovak-Russian relations,’ added Robert Fico.”

Senior Russian general ‘killed by one of Putin’s own landmines’ in Ukraine

Russia may have lost as many as six high-ranking officers in Ukraine in just one week following reports a senior general was killed by a landmine placed by his own side.

Major general Vladimir Zavadsky, 45, the deputy commander of the 14th Army Corps, died in occupied Ukraine on Tuesday, reported pro-Kremlin newspaper Lenta.

The elite military academy where Zavadsky studied, the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School, also announced his death in a social media post, although that has now been deleted.

Russia’s defence ministry has not officially commented on the reports.

Zavadsky was not reported to have been killed in action. According to the Telegram channel VChK-OGPU, which claims to have ties to Russian security services, the general died in a blast on a landmine placed by Vladimir Putin’s own forces to target Ukrainian reconnaissance groups.

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov faced western critics while attending international security talks in Northern Macedonia, where he blamed “Nato’s reckless expansion to the East” for war returning to Europe.

Mr Lavrov arrived in Skopje to attend meetings hosted by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation (OSCE) in Europe.

The diplomats of several OSCE member nations, including Ukraine, boycotted the event due to Mr Lavrov’s planned attendance amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.

He spoke for 15 minutes on Thursday before walking out of the meetings and blamed what he described as western tolerance of the “ruling neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv” for the war.

“The very existence of Russians and their decisive contribution to the history of Ukraine are denied,” Mr Lavrov said. “There are plenty of facts. The OSCE and its relevant institutions are silent.”

A second person has been confirmed killed following an overnight missile attack in eastern Ukraine.

Earlier, officials had said one person was killed after six missiles struck the three settlements of Pokrovsk, Novohrodivka and Myrnohrad. In the afternoon, rescuers had retrieved a second body from the debris, according to Ukrainian police.

Police said on Telegram that a 33-year-old woman, a 38-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl could still be under the rubble of a residential building in Novohrodivka.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said earlier 10 people, including four children, were wounded. Nine private houses, a police station, cars, and garages were damaged, he added.

Russia’s top court has ruled that LGBT+ activists should be designated as “extremists” and issued a ban against such work – the most drastic step in a years-long crackdown on the community in ther country.

The move effectively outlaws LGBT+ activism across the country, in a move that representatives of the gay and transgender communities fear will lead to arrests and prosecutions.

Russia is assembling a ‘poorly trained’ regiment, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence

In their latest intelligence update, the MoD said Russia’s airborne forces, the VDV, has likely started deploying the newly formed 104th Guards Airborne Division in Ukraine for the first time.

They added: “The division will likely be poorly trained and is unlikely to meet the erstwhile elite standards of the VDV.”

EU's defence strategy needs to include Ukraine, von der Leyen says

The European Union should take Ukraine’s military needs into account as it determines the future strategy of Europe’s defence industry, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.

“Our strategy can only be complete if it also takes into account Ukraine’s needs and Ukraine’s industrial capacity,” von der Leyen said in a speech at the annual conference of the European Defence Agency.

Von der Leyen said Ukraine should be integrated into EU defence programmes to help cater to its needs in its war against the Russian invasion.

Russian missiles have torn through apartment buildings in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, killing at least one person and burying families under rubble.

The missiles hit three Donetsk cities, Pokrovsk, Novohrodivka and Myrnohrad, Ukrainian internal affairs minister Ihor Klymenko said.

Emergency workers pulled the body of a 62-year-old man from the wreckage of a destroyed multi-storey building in Novohrodivka.

Four more people may be under the rubble, including a child, authorities said.

In Pokrovsk, the strikes destroyed a multi-storey building, nine houses, a police office and cars. Emergency crews helped rescue a man with a six-month-old baby, covered in blood, in his hands, officials said.

The head of the city administration, Serhii Dobriak, said it is fourth time Pokrovsk has come under attack in the past month.

“They are striking the city centre, the houses,” he said. “They are just destroying the civilian population.”

All three of the targeted cities are close to Avdiivka, a city where a fierce battle has taken place in recent months.

Ukrainian officials said recently that Russian forces have ramped up attacks in eastern Ukraine in a bid to gain ground near Avdiivka and around Bakhmut, another key frontline city.

The Ukrainian military said earlier on Thursday its air defence shot down 14 out of 20 drones in a Russian overnight strike.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited troops near the Kupiansk sector of the frontline in the country’s northeast, he announced on social media on Thursday.

“I thank the warriors for their service, for defending our state,” Zelenskyy wrote on X, adding photos which showed him visiting a command post alongside a top Ukrainian general.

Russia has accused Bulgaria of malice and stupidity on Thursday for refusing to allow Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s plane to fly through its airspace.

The plane was forced to take a longer route over Greece to deliver Lavrov to a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Skopje, North Macedonia.

Zakharova wrote on the Telegram messenger app: “The malicious stupidity of the Russophobes reached the point that, for the first time in our history, official authorities banned not an airplane, but a person on that airplane.”

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who is under European Union sanctions, said her presence on board the plane was the reason given by Bulgaria’s foreign ministry for denying access to its airspace.

No comment was immediately available from the Bulgarian ministry.

The Russian overnight missile strike has claimed one life, says Ukrainian interior minister.

Moscow carried out an overnight attack on the eastern region of Donetsk which has injured 10 and left four trapped under rubble.

Russia fired six missiles at three settlements in the region, most of which is occupied by Russian forces, Klymenko said on Telegram messaging app.

“Pokrovsk, Novohrodivka and Myrnohrad came under fire. The shelling injured 10 people, including four children. Five more people are being searched for under the rubble,” the minister said.

Later, Donetsk authorities said rescuers found one body while four others, including one child, were still under the rubble.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday expressed his condolences over the death of former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, saying in a telegram to Kissinger’s widow Nancy that he was a “wise and farsighted statesman”.

“The name of Henry Kissinger is inextricably linked with a pragmatic foreign policy line, which at one time made it possible to achieve detente in international tensions and reach the most important Soviet-American agreements that contributed to the strengthening of global security,” Putin said.

“I had the opportunity to personally communicate with this deep, extraordinary man many times, and I will undoubtedly retain the fondest memory of him.”

Kissinger, who died on Wednesday at the age of 100, pursued dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1970s that led to the first major nuclear arms control treaties between the two Cold War superpowers.

Five decades on, the war in Ukraine has raised tensions between Moscow and Washington to their most acute point since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and the Kremlin has described the current state of relations as “below zero”.

‘Let us be a lesson’ - Kazakhstan’s message to leaders about risk of nuclear war

As Russia warns of the rising risk of nuclear war, and relations with the United States sink into a deep freeze, communities close to the vast Soviet-era nuclear testing site in northern Kazakhstan have a message for leaders: “Let us be a lesson.”

Hundreds of tests were carried out between 1949 and 1989 on the barren steppe near the city of Semey, formerly known as Semipalatinsk, close to the Kazakh-Russian border. The effect of radiation had a devastating impact on the environment and local people’s health, and continues to affect lives there today.

Many nuclear proliferation experts believe resuming testing by either nuclear superpower more than 30 years after the last test is unlikely soon.

But tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have led to increasingly hostile rhetoric, and the arms control architecture built since the Soviet Union’s collapse more than three decades ago has begun to unravel.

In early November, President Vladimir Putin revoked Russia’s ratification of the 1996 global treaty banning nuclear weapons tests. Moscow says it will not lead to a resumption of testing unless the United States does first.

“Let our suffering be a lesson to others,” said Serikbay Ybyrai, local leader in the village of Saryzhal, who saw tests being carried out some 20 km (12 miles) away when he was a boy. “If this (testing) resumes, humanity will disappear.”

Putin urges Russian women to have ‘eight or more’ children amid soaring deaths in his Ukraine war

Vladimir Putin has urged Russian women to have eight or more children and make large families “the norm” amid soaring numbers of casualties in his war against Ukraine.

Russia’s birth rate has been steadily falling since the 90’s and the country has suffered more than 300,000 casualties since the start of the Ukraine conflict, according to data maintained by Kyiv.

In a speech via video link at the World Russian People’s Council in Moscow on Tuesday, Mr Putin said boosting the Russian population will be “our goal for the coming decades”.

“Many of our peoples maintain the tradition of the family, where four, five or more children are raised,” said Mr Putin. “Recall that in Russian families our grandmothers and great-grandmothers had both 7 and 8 children. Let us preserve and revive these traditions. Having many children, a large family, should become a norm, a way of life for all the peoples of Russia.”

Senior Russian general ‘killed by one of Putin’s own landmines’ in Ukraine

Russia may have lost as many as six high-ranking officers in Ukraine in just one week following reports a senior general was killed by a landmine placed by his own side.

Major general Vladimir Zavadsky, 45, the deputy commander of the 14th Army Corps, died in occupied Ukraine on Tuesday, reported pro-Kremlin newspaper Lenta.

The elite military academy where Zavadsky studied, the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School, also announced his death in a social media post, although that has now been deleted.

Russia’s defence ministry has not officially commented on the reports.

Zavadsky was not reported to have been killed in action. According to the Telegram channel VChK-OGPU, which claims to have ties to Russian security services, the general died in a blast on a landmine placed by Vladimir Putin’s own forces to target Ukrainian reconnaissance groups.

Senior Russian general ‘killed by one of Putin’s own landmines’ in Ukraine

Ten people were hurt and five appeared under rubble in overnight Russian missile attacks in Ukraine‘s eastern Donetsk region, Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko said on Thursday.

Russia fired six missiles at three settlements in the region, most of which is occupied by Russian forces, Klymenko said on Telegram messaging app.

“Pokrovsk, Novohrodivka and Myrnohrad came under fire. The shelling injured 10 people, including 4 children. Five more people are being searched for under the rubble,” the minister said.

He said among the victims were a family with two children and two 13-year-old children. An apartment block, nine private houses, a police station, cars and garages were damaged.

Klymenko said a police paramedic helped a man with an injured baby get out from under the rubble.

Invading Russian forces have occupied much of Donetsk and Russia has said it intends to take over the whole region.

The Ukrainian military said earlier on Thursday its air defence shot down 14 out of 20 drones in a Russian overnight strike.

Ukraine air defence shot down 14 out of 20 drones in a Russian overnight strike, the nation’s air force said on Thursday.

The air force said in a statement the Russian forces launched Iranian-made drones from Russian territory in several directions.

The government of Slovakia is set to add honey, barley, wheat flour, soybeans, and cane or beet sugar to the list of banned agricultural products, according to the Kyiv Independent.

The ban previously applied to four cereals, namely wheat, corn, rapeseed, and sunflower seeds, and will remain in place until the end of 2023.

Ukraine and Slovakia had previously agreed to a licensing system for their grain trade in September which raised homes the ban could have been lifted.

In case you missed it: At least fourteen people dead in Ukraine and Russia snowstorm

At least 14 people died due to extreme weather conditions as a winter storm lashed parts of Russia and Ukraine, knocking out power from hundreds and thousands of households.

The severe cold struck war-torn Ukraine at a time when thousands of both Russian and Ukrainian troops were engaged in intense fighting in the eastern towns near the Black Sea almost 22 months into Vladimir Putin’s invasion.

Kyiv fears Moscow could attack its power grids with air strikes this winter.

In Ukraine, at least 10 people were killed and almost 1,500 towns and villages were left without power after storms dumped up to 10 inches of snow in some places.

“As a result of worsening weather conditions, 10 people died in Odesa, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kyiv regions,” interior minister Ihor Klymenko said on Tuesday.

France aiming to complete security accord with Ukraine by start of 2024

“On the security guarantees and the work we have been doing with our Ukrainians partners - we are working towards a conclusion of this accord with the Ukrainian authorities by the end of the year, start of next year,” Anne-Claire Legendre told reporters at a weekly news briefing.

A diplomatic source said early 2024 was more likely.

The accord would outline the framework for long-term humanitarian aid, support for reconstruction and military assistance, she said.

A second diplomatic source said the accord would not provide detailed financial figures or commitments as such with the French government not wanting to have the text going to parliament for approval.

“I think that the Ukrainians are in a logic where they want to see what the Americans offer them for benchmarking for others,” the source said.

“Our proposal to them doesn’t contain figures. It’s more our objectives. We describe the type of action we are ready to take in terms of military support, economic support, etc.”

G7 countries in June unveiled an international framework for the long-term security of Ukraine to boost its finances and defences against Russia with a view to deterring Moscow from future aggression, officials said.

Unable to join NATO while the war with Russia continues - given that NATO’s Article 5, stipulating that an attack on one member is an attack on all, could push it into war with Russia - Ukraine has lobbied for long-term security commitments from its main backers.

Countries, including France, have been negotiating bilaterally since June, but there has been scant detail on what countries are willing to do and with the war entering its second year there are question marks about how committed Kyiv’s allies may be.

A funeral for a Ukrainian servicemen killed in the conflict with Russia took place on Wednesday.

Sergiy Pavlichenko was killed fighting Russian troops in the Zaporizhzhia region.

He was buried in Kyiv.

Lord David Cameron met European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, who leads on Brexit matters for the bloc, in Brussels on Wednesday.

The former prime minister tweeted: “Good to speak with Maros Sefcovic in Brussels.

“I look forward to working together on the issues that matter to us both, including support for Ukraine, the Withdrawal Agreement and maximising the opportunities of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.

In case you missed it: Ukraine spy chief’s wife treated for suspected metal poisoning

The wife of Ukraine’s intelligence chief has been diagnosed with heavy metals poisoning and is undergoing treatment in hospital, it emerged on Tuesday. Meanwhile, deadly winter weather has hit the front lines of the conflict with Russia.

Marianna Budanova is the wife of Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency known by its local acronym GUR.

Her condition was confirmed to AP by Andriy Yusov, the agency’s spokesman.

He did not provide more details about the alleged poisoning, nor did he say if it was believed to have been intended for Mr Budanov or whether Russia was thought to be behind it.

Earlier this year, he told Ukrainian media that the military intelligence chief had survived 10 assassination attempts carried out by the Russian state or federal security services.

Around 78% of Ukrainians in favour of joining the EU

A new survey has revealed that 78 per cent of Ukrainians are in favour of joining the EU with only 5 per cent opposing accession.

In a statement on their website, the Rating Group who conducted their 25th annual survey said its purpose was to conduct “a study of the dynamics of the attitude of the Ukrainian population to international unions”.

However, the figures represent a drop as in July a poll revealed that 85 per cent of Ukrainians favoured joining the EU. Likewise, a drop in support for joining NATO was observed, however most Ukrainians were still in support.

The new study revealed that 77 per cent favoured joining the EU, a significant majority, although this number was down from 83 per cent in July.

France aiming to complete security accord with Ukraine by start of 2024

France intends to complete a bilateral security guarantee accord with Ukraine at the start of 2024, its foreign ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.

Paris has been negotiating with Kyiv for several months with the agreement aimed at agreeing the broad lines of long-term financial, humanitarian and military support, Anne-Claire Legendre told reporters at a weekly press briefing.

Zelensky: 'Today we are working in Odesa region’

President Zelensky confirmed he was focused in the Odesa region on Wednesday.

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, he said:

“We started with reports from the military and a meeting on the protection of the region. The situation in the Black Sea, mine countermeasures and ensuring the security of the grain corridor.

“The work of air defense in Odesa region, air cover for Odesa and our ports. I presented state awards to the warriors defending the southern regions and our Black Sea water area.

“I visited the regional center for IDPs in Odesa. I also held a meeting on eliminating the aftermath of severe weather. We must speed up the restoration of electricity supply in the affected towns and villages.”

Ukraine insists it sees no sign of NATO war fatigue even as fighting and weapons supplies stall

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba insisted on Wednesday that NATO allies are showing no sign of war fatigue and remain committed to helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia and take back occupied territory.

Speaking to The Associated Press, Kuleba also said that President Vladimir Putin is miscalculating if he sees any value in keeping his forces in Ukraine at least until presidential elections in the United States in a year’s time, which could usher in a new administration.

“I heard a clear ‘no’ to any reference to fatigue, and I heard (a) clear ‘yes’ to increased support to Ukraine,” Kuleba said after meeting NATO counterparts in Brussels. He said that some allies had made fresh offers of support, but he declined to provide details.

“They understand that in order for them to feel safe, in order for them not to end up in a situation where NATO’s soldiers will have to fight, Ukraine has to win in this war,” Kuleba said.

Zelenskiy: ‘OPCW is a very reputable international body and terrorists have no place in it’

Russia failed to be elected on to the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Weapons for the first time in history.

Meanwhile Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania were elected for the 2024-2026 period.

The Executive Council is made up of 41 member states. It states its mission is to “achieve a world permanently free of chemical weapons and to contribute to international security and stability, general and complete disarmament, and global economic development.”

President Zelensky welcomed the decision saying that international body had no place for “terrorists” in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Here’ is the latest map of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to war monitoring think-thank the Institute for the Study of War.

Ukraine and the European Union cannot be “taken hostage” by Polish truckers blockading the Polish-Ukrainian border in protest at competition from Ukrainian hauliers, the European Commissioner for Transport said on Wednesday.

The round-the-clock blockade in Medyka and three other border crossings, which started on Monday, extends a protest that has left over a thousand lorries stranded for days in queues that stretch for miles.

Transport commissioner Adina Valean said the situation was “unacceptable”.

Polish truckers complain they are losing out to Ukrainian companies which offer cheaper prices for their services and which are transporting goods within the EU, rather than just between the bloc and Ukraine.

“There is no good faith in finding a solution... and there is nearly a complete lack of involvement from Polish authorities... who are supposed to enforce the law at that border,” Valean said.

“While I support the people’s right to protest, the entire EU, not to mention Ukraine, a country currently at war, cannot be taken hostage by blocking our external borders.”

Four killed in Ukrainian strike on Kherson region police station

Four police officers were killed and another 18 people wounded in a Ukrainian HIMARS strike on a police station in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s Kherson region on Tuesday, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Wednesday.

TASS quoted a local police spokesperson as saying that five police officers had been critically wounded in the strike on a facility in the village of Yuvileine.

Reuters could not independently verify the report but fighting in the Kherson region has heated up in recent months, with Ukrainian forces making a number of incursions on the Russian-held eastern bank of the Dnipro river, which divides the province.

Former U.S. marine Paul Whelan has been attacked by another inmate in a Russian prison while serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges, Russia‘s prison service said on Wednesday.

Whelan, who denies spying on Russia, was punched in the face and forced to defend himself at a sewing workshop in a high security penal colony southeast of Moscow, his brother Dave Whelan said in a statement.

“A new prisoner blocked part of the production line and Paul asked him to move out of the way. After repeated requests, the prisoner hit Paul in the face, breaking Paul’s glasses in the process, and attempted to hit him a second time,” Dave Whelan said.

“Paul stood up to block the second hit and other prisoners intervened to prevent the prisoner continuing the attack on Paul.”

Arrested in 2018 in Russia, Paul Whelan was convicted of espionage in 2020 and handed a 16-year sentence.

Dave Whelan said the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon. He thought his brother was a target because he was an American and anti-American sentiment was “not uncommon among the other prisoners”.

Furloughed workers at Volkswagen’s former plant in Russia are being offered redundancy, according to the union representing them.

The plant, in Russia’s Kaluga region south of Moscow, has annual production capacity of 225,000 cars, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought work to a standstill. The plant will remain idle until at least March 2024, the trade union added.

Under the furlough scheme being offered by the new owners, who took over the plant in May, the staff are currently paid two thirds of their salary.

They are now being offered three months’ pay if they quit, with bonuses for those who have been employed there for a long time.

Only a few of the remaining staff of around 3,600 people have taken up the new owners on their offer so far, Elena Kryukova, head of the MPRA trade union’s plant committee, told Reuters.

Russian man who traced ‘No to War’ in snow jailed

A Russian court has ordered a man to be jailed for 10 days after he used his finger to write “No to War” on a snow-covered turnstile.

According to court papers, the incident happened on November 23 at the entrance to an ice-skating rink at Moscow’s Gorky Park.

The man, named as Dmitry Fyodorov, was sentenced the following day after being detained by the police.

Police decided his actions could amount to a civil offence under a law which targets anyone deemed to have acted publicly to discredit Russia’s armed forces, a crime which in his case was punishable by a fine.

New laws cracking down on dissent were brought in soon after President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022 in what he called a “special military operation.”

For those opposed to Russia’s war in Ukraine, speaking out in public has since become a risky thing to do and critics say nearly 20,000 people have been detained and over 800 criminal cases opened.

The Ukrainian military has claimed the number of Russian casualties since the beginning of the ward has reached 327,580.

In its latest update, they added that 5,538 Russian tanks and 10,312 Russian armored combat vehicles had been destroyed.

Putin won’t consider stopping Ukraine war until after US election, says Biden official

Vladimir Putin will not consider ending his invasion of Ukraine until he knows the result of the 2024 US presidential election, a senior official from the Joe Biden administration has said.

Putin won’t consider stopping Ukraine war until after US election – official

Russia warns US against entering new arms race

A senior Russian diplomat said the US would be mistaken to expect to win the next armed race.

Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister in charge of ties with the U.S., non-proliferation and arms control, also told the Izvestia daily that a military conflict between NATO and Moscow could not be ruled out.

“If the United States expects to win the next arms race, repeating to some extent the experience of the presidency of Ronald Reagan ... then the Americans are mistaken,” Izvestia cited Ryabkov as saying.

“We will not succumb to provocations .... but we can guarantee that we will ensure our security.”

He also told the newspaper that Russia was not threatening a conflict with the Western military alliance and that “the onus is entirely on NATO’s side”.

'No sense of fatigue' when it comes to support for Ukraine, Blinken says

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that there was “no sense of fatigue” among NATO allies when it came to helping Ukraine.

“We must and we will continue to support Ukraine,” he said after a NATO-Ukraine meeting in Brussels, adding that NATO allies were unanimous on this position and that he was also hearing continued support for Ukraine in both chambers of the US Congress.

Kyiv has been concerned that the Israel-Hamas war could divert international attention away from its efforts to defeat Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

“It is important that our solidarity with Ukraine is not only demonstrated in words but also in deeds,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said, urging allies to do more. “These are concrete actions, we need more of them and we need sustained and stepped up support.”

Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that its forces had taken control of a village in eastern Ukraine.

Khromove, which Russia calls Artyomovskoe, is on the western outskirts of Bakhmut, a city which Russia captured last summer after a months-long battle. The village had a pre-war population of 1,000 people.

Reuters could not independently verify the defence ministry’s assertion and there was no immediate comment from Ukraine."

Ukrainian officials said the country came under attack from Russian drones and missiles overnight, with a number of people, including a baby, hurt in strikes on the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said 10 people were hurt in overnight Russian missile attacks on three areas of Donetsk, occupied in large part by Russian forces. An injured baby was rescued from the rubble of one building.

In other news, Russia's presence at a European security meeting taking place Thursday is causing a stir.

Member countries are reportedly divided over the fact that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is attending the annual meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, with Baltic nations and Ukraine refusing to attend as a result.

Germany's Scholz stresses 'unwavering solidarity' with Ukraine on call with Zelenskyy

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed the latest political, military and humanitarian situation in Ukraine in a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, the German government said in a statement.

Scholz told the Ukrainian president that Germany would continue to support Ukraine along with European and international partners.

Scholz also reiterated Germany's ""ongoing and unwavering solidarity"" with Ukraine and said that its ""future lies in the European Union,"" according to the statement.

Zelenskyy discussed recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian civil energy infrastructure and thanked Germany for its military support.

Russia's Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that LGBT activists should be designated as extremists, in a move that representatives of gay and transgender people fear will lead to arrests and prosecutions.

A Reuters reporter in court heard it announce that it had approved a request from the justice ministry to recognise what it called ""the international LGBT social movement"" as extremist and to ban its activities.

The move is part of a pattern of increasing restrictions in Russia on expressions of sexual orientation and gender identity, including laws outlawing the promotion of ""non-traditional"" sexual relations and banning legal or medical changes of gender.

President Vladimir Putin, expected shortly to announce that he will seek a new six-year term in March, has long sought to promote an image of Russia as a guardian of traditional moral values in contrast with a decadent West.

In a speech last year, he said the West was welcome to adopt ""rather strange, in my view, new-fangled trends like dozens of genders, and gay parades"" but had no right to impose them on other countries.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters before the court decision was announced that the Kremlin was ""not following"" the case and had no comment on it. The Supreme Court took around five hours to issue its ruling, after opening its session at 10 a.m. local time.

Lavrov tells the OSCE it's 'on the brink of an abyss'

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on Thursday that the group was ""on the brink of an abyss.""

Attending the OSCE's latest meeting in Skopje, North Macedonia, Lavrov accused the 57-member security-oriented organization that it was ""essentially being turned into an appendage of NATO and the European Union.""

""The organization, let's admit it frankly, is on the brink of an abyss,"" he said, according to comments reported by Interfax.

""A simple question arises: does it make sense to invest efforts in reviving it?,"" he asked, questioning the equality of member countries and approach to regional security problems.

So far, he said, ""there are many more questions than answers.""

""But in the meantime, life does not stand still, the processes of Eurasian integration and equal cooperation based on an honest balance of interests are developing on our continent in constructive formats, regardless of the OSCE's ever deeper immersion in the imposed confrontational agenda,"" Lavrov said.

Ukraine and the Baltic nations boycotted this year's OSCE meeting because of Lavrov's attendance. The OSCE has also largely been hamstrung when it comes to decision-making because Russia has used its vetoes to thwart the process, putting its future into question.

EU's defense strategy needs to include Ukraine, von der Leyen says

The European Union should take Ukraine's military needs into account as it determines the future strategy of Europe's defense industry, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.

""Our strategy can only be complete if it also takes into account Ukraine's needs and Ukraine's industrial capacity,"" von der Leyen said in a speech at the annual conference of the European Defence Agency.

Von der Leyen said Ukraine should be integrated into EU defense programs to help cater to its needs in its war against the Russian invasion.

""The first step to achieve this, is to involve Ukraine in the consultation process of the Industrial Strategy,"" von der Leyen said.

""This should lead to integrating Ukraine in some of our defense programs, with the agreement of the European Parliament and Council, where necessary.""

The commission aims to propose its European Defence Industry Programme early next year, von der Leyen said, which would also look at ways to fund the industry.

As part of this, the commission will try to see how it can get the defense industry's contribution to Europe security recognised by sustainable financial investors, she said.

The EU's defence industry would next year meet a target to increase its production capacity of ammunition rounds to 1 million rounds per year, von der Leyen added.

The target is separate from an EU plan to provide 1 million artillery shells and missiles to Ukraine within a year - a goal that German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and other officials have said the bloc is unlikely to reach.

Putin will address the Russian nation on Dec. 14

Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold his annual press conference as well as a public phone-in on Dec. 14, the Kremlin said Thursday.

The two events are usually held separately but will be combined next month.

There's speculation that Putin will use the occasion to announce that he is running for president yet again in the 2024 election.

The Kremlin has repeatedly refused to say whether Putin will run for another six years in office although it's widely expected that he will do so.

Putin has been in power for 23 years, both as prime minister or president, and has presided over the systematic oppression of critics and political opponents during that time, meaning he is very likely to win the next election when it takes place in March.

Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's press secretary, told CNBC that he had ""no doubt that if he puts forward his candidacy, he will win confidently. Society is consolidated around the president,"" Peskov added.

It'll be interesting to see how much the war in Ukraine features in Putin's press conference and public phone-in with reports suggesting Putin would try to avoid focusing on the continuing conflict ahead of the election, and as the war heads toward a two-year anniversary in February next year.

The Kremlin said Thursday that Bulgaria's decision to refuse to allow Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's plane to fly through its airspace was ""stupid.""

Lavrov's plane was forced to take a longer route over Greece as he traveled to Skopje in North Macedonia for the latest meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

""Of course, such a position of the Bulgarian authorities can hardly be explained by anything. It does not fit into any framework. It is absolutely absurd, one might even say stupid,"" Peskov told reporters, state news agency RIA Novosti reported.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in earlier comments that the reason given for the refusal to allow the Russian plane to travel through Bulgarian airspace was the fact that she was on board the plane.

""The evil stupidity of the Russophobes reached the point that for the first time in our history, the official authorities banned not an airplane, but a person on the airplane from being in the sky — this is what was written in the official note of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry: an airplane can fly over Bulgaria, but Maria Zakharova cannot fly on an airplane,"" she wrote on Telegram.

Zakharova was sanctioned by the EU as she was deemed ""a central figure of [Russian] government propaganda"" and promoted the deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine. Sanctions on individuals consist of travel bans and asset freezes.

In her Telegram post, Zakharova argued that ""the already illegal European Union sanctions cannot extend to the non-stop flight on an aircraft of a person who is prohibited from entering the territory of the state.""

Bulgaria has not commented on the incident.

One killed in overnight strikes on eastern Ukraine

One person is now known to have died as a result of overnight missile strikes on Donetsk in eastern Ukraine.

Russia attacked the towns of Pokrovsk, Novogrodivka and Myrnograd in the western part of Donetsk overnight in what Ihor Moroz, the acting head of the regional military administration, described as ""a massive rocket attack.""

One person is known to have been killed in the strikes and 10 others were injured. It's believed that four people, including one child, are still trapped under the rubble, Moroz said on Telegram Thursday.

""At the site of the shelling of a residential building in Novogrodivka, the body of a dead man was recovered from the rubble,"" he said. The search and rescue operation is ongoing.

In Pokrovsk, five people were injured, with damage caused to 11 private houses, as well as a multi-story building, administrative building and an educational institution. Five people were injured in Novogrodivka, and in Myrnograd, an administration building was damaged, he said.

Russian missiles and drones strike Ukraine overnight, injuring at least 10 people

Ukrainian officials said the country came under attack from Russian drones and missiles overnight, with a number of people, including a baby, hurt in strikes on the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said 10 people were hurt in overnight Russian missile attacks on three areas of Donetsk, a region which is occupied in large part by Russian forces.

""Pokrovsk, Novogrodivka and Myrnograd came under fire. As a result of shelling, 10 people were injured, including 4 children. Five more people are being searched for under the rubble,"" Klymenko said on Telegram.

In one strike, a family with two children were among the injured in one of the attacks, he said.

""Among the victims is a family with two children: a 16-year-old boy and a 6-month-old baby. A 13-year-old boy was also injured. An apartment building and 9 private buildings, a police station, cars, and garages were previously damaged.""

Klymenko said a police paramedic helped a man with an injured baby to get out from under the rubble of a building. The baby was not in a life-threatening condition, he said.

Fighting is intense in Donetsk as Ukraine and Russian forces battle over key towns in the region, such as Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed Wednesday that Russian forces captured Khromove, on the western outskirts of Bakhmut, although this has not been confirmed.

Ukraine's air force said Thursday that 14 out of 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones were destroyed overnight with anti-aircraft defenses in action in the southern, eastern and central regions of Ukraine.

Member countries are divided over the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's annual foreign ministers' meeting on Thursday with Baltic nations and Ukraine refusing to attend over the presence of Russia's Sergei Lavrov.

The 57-member OSCE is the successor to a Cold War-era organisation for Soviet and Western powers to engage but is now largely paralysed by Russia's ongoing use of the effective veto each country has.

The U.S. and its allies are seeking simultaneously to keep the OSCE alive and hold Russia to account for its invasion of Ukraine. They are attending while making a point of denouncing Moscow's actions - a stance that some of Ukraine's closest allies have little truck with.

""How can you talk with an aggressor who is committing genocide, full aggression against another member state, Ukraine?"" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told reporters on Wednesday in Brussels where he attended a NATO meeting.

Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia are siding with Ukraine on the issue. Russia's Tass news agency reported Lavrov arrived in Skopje on Wednesday after a circuitous five-hour flight that avoided the airspace of countries that have barred Russian aircraft.

The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said he understood unease about Lavrov attending the meeting in Skopje, North Macedonia. But he said it was a chance for Lavrov to hear broad condemnation of Russia's war in Ukraine.

""Your decision to allow Lavrov to participate is in line with our common objective to keep multilateralism alive,"" Borrell told North Macedonia's Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski at a joint press conference in Skopje.

""Lavrov needs to hear again, from everyone, why Russia is being condemned and isolated,"" Borrell said. ""Then he will be able to come back to the Kremlin and report to the Kremlin master.

Estonia had been due to take over the annually rotating OSCE chairmanship but Russia blocked it for months. A last-minute deal for neutral Malta to take over the chairmanship must be formally approved at the meeting on Thursday and Friday.

NATO has 'unwavering' support for Ukraine, Blinken says

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that support for Ukraine was strong and would continue, as NATO foreign ministers met Ukrainian officials in Brussels to discuss the war on Wednesday.

""I have to tell you, listening to all of our colleagues around the table, every single one expressed strong enduring support for Ukraine,"" he told reporters.

""Some are questioning whether the United States and other NATO allies should continue to stand with Ukraine as we enter the second winter of Putin's brutality. But the answer here today at NATO is clear, and it's unwavering: We must and we will continue to support Ukraine.""

Questions have been raised about the longevity of U.S. support for Ukraine given the forthcoming 2024 election and rumblings of discontent among some Republicans about continued military assistance.

Blinken insisted Wednesday that ""the United States is not standing alone.""

""So we often talk about burden sharing and the imperative of burden sharing when it comes to Ukraine. That's clearly what we've seen and what we continue to see.""

Russian man who traced 'No to War' in the snow gets 10 days in jail

A Russian court has ordered a man to be jailed for 10 days after he used his finger to write ""No to War"" on a snow-covered turnstile at the entrance to an ice-skating rink at Moscow's Gorky Park.

According to court papers, the incident happened on Nov. 23 and the man, named as Dmitry Fyodorov, was sentenced the following day after being detained by the police.

Police decided his actions could amount to a civil offence under a law which targets anyone deemed to have acted publicly to discredit Russia's armed forces, a crime which in his case was punishable by a fine.

New laws cracking down on dissent were brought in soon after President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022 in what he called a ""special military operation.""

For those opposed to Russia's war in Ukraine, speaking out in public has since become a risky thing to do and critics say nearly 20,000 people have been detained and over 800 criminal cases opened.

Fyodorov, who admitted in court that he'd written the anti-war slogan, was handed ten days in jail for disobeying the police and allegedly refusing to go to a police station, something he denied according to the court papers.

He was also fined an unknown sum — apparently for writing ""No to War"" — according to Russian media reports, though there was no mention of that in court papers posted online.

The authorities say maximum unity is needed at a time when Russia is locked in what Putin — who is expected to seek another six-year term in office next year — has described as an existential battle with the West. Critics accuse the authorities of brutally shutting down and punishing any dissenting voices.

Russia says it has taken control of village outside Bakhmut

Russia's defense ministry claimed Wednesday that its forces had taken control of a village on the outskirts of the wartorn town of Bakhmut in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine.

The ministry said units of its southern group of forces had ""liberated"" the village of Artemovskoye (called Khromove in Ukrainian) in what Russia calls the Donetsk People's Republic, a self-proclaimed republic and pro-Russian separatist region.

""Units of the Southern Group of Forces, with the support of aviation and artillery fire, improved the situation along the front line and liberated the village of Artemovskoye,"" the ministry said, according to comments reported by the TASS news agency.

The village had a pre-war population of 1,000 people, Reuters noted, and lies just east of Bakhmut, a town captured by Russian forces earlier this year after months of fighting that left the town largely destroyed.

CNBC could not verify the defense ministry's claim and Ukraine is yet to comment.

Russia slams Finland's border closure, saying it's 'not threatened by anyone or anything'

The Kremlin slammed Finland's decision to close all of its border crossing points with Russia, saying the decision was unjustified.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that the decision to close the last open border crossing until Dec.13 was excessive.

""Finland is not threatened by anyone or anything, and in this case this is, of course, an absolutely redundant measure to ensure border security, because there is no threat there and in reality there is no tension,"" the Kremlin spokesman told reporters, according to Google-translated comments carried by state news agency Tass.

Finland made the decision to close its border Tuesday, after repeatedly accusing Russia of purposefully sending undocumented migrants through crossing points in a bid to create instability in Finland. Helsinki sees the ""hybrid attack operation,"" as it has described it, as retaliation for its joining NATO earlier this year.

Russia denies ""weaponizing"" migration — an accusation made by Finland and other countries, including Estonia and Latvia.

There have been media reports Wednesday that Poland plans to send troops to Finland's border with Russia in an effort to shore up security there. Asked about those reports, Peskov said that this would represent a ""completely unprovoked, unjustified concentration of armed units on the Russian border.""

He added that ""tension may arise as a result of the concentration of additional units on the border.""

""The Finns must be clearly aware that this will pose a threat to us by increasing the concentration of military units on our borders,"" Peskov warned.

The Minister is seeking to bring forward legislation to enable facial recognition technology (FRT) to enable speedier prosecutions of offenders involved in violence and looting. The use of the technology was initially drawn up to deal with murder, rape, terrorism, and child sexual abuse.

Cllr Stokes has written to the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, and the Green Party Leader, Eamon Ryan to raise a number of specific concerns.

""There are many problems with this technology ranging from privacy consent, to the risk of misuse, such as individuals exploiting it for personal use,” he said.

""Like with many systems, there can be flaws. In this case there is a significant risk of misidentifying people. Earlier this year the Guardian ran a story that highlighted the poor accuracy in relation to people who are black, female and between the ages of 18-30.""

The Green Party previously resisted handing facial recognition technology to gardaí, but they are under increasing pressure from cabinet colleagues and Cllr Stokes has urged him to stay strong against the encroachment of civil liberties.

""Facial recognition technology is used for mass surveillance in China. This would be a major milestone against civil rights. Additionally, if the Irish Government introduces this surveillance, it gives a green light to other countries to follow suit. They can point to Ireland as an example of allowing this type of snooping.""

Instead Cllr Stokes is urging the Government to focus on Garda staffing.

""The Government wants to be seen to be doing something about the Dublin riots on November 23. I condemn the perpetrators of the riots and looting. However, from the videos and pictures that I saw, they seem to be well covered by masks and hoods. This would largely render facial recognition technology useless in this situation. What we really need is more police.

""The Irish people have been failed badly in this regard. The Government has allowed the garda numbers to run right down. While I accept that Covid disrupted recruitment, this has been going on for many years. We also need to focus on garda retention. If people can find better pay and conditions they are likely to look elsewhere.""

Cllr Stokes highlighted the plight of an innocent man, Robert Williams, whom in 2020, was wrongly arrested in Detroit, US. Mr Williams had been identified by grainy CCTV, combined with AI technology.

""This type of surveillance is a recipe for mistakes. It should be stopped,"" Cllr Stokes said, and added that a wide range of people and organisations have urged that facial recognition technology be halted, including the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.

""It's no surprise that the European Union has sought to ban mass surveillance. Facial recognition technology is a threat to freedom and civil rights."""

1143485721,20231130,"More than 400 companies involved in Europe’s solar power sector urged policymakers on Wednesday not to launch a trade investigation that could lead to EU tariffs on imported solar products.

The call comes ahead of a meeting of solar industry chiefs, national ministers and the EU commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, on Friday to assess measures to bring production back to Europe.

“Ahead of the industry roundtable on Friday, we’re getting worrying signals that a trade defence investigation is about to be announced,” said Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of industry association SolarPower Europe.

“This flies in the face of the path we have set out for European solar re-industrialisation,” she continued.

SolarPower Europe, which coordinated the call, said signatories included 18 manufacturers and 28 national associations and research institutes. All agreed that tariffs should not apply to imported photovoltaic (PV) products.

Separately, the European PV manufacturing industry lobby has been pressing the EU to protect the bloc’s domestic photovoltaic industry from what it called Chinese “unfair competition”.

In a letter last week, the lobby asked EU member states to support extending non-price criteria for domestically produced solar hardware into public procurements and auctions, as part of the EU Net Zero Industry Act that aims at having at least 40% of solar components produced within the bloc by 2030. Non-price criteria include quality and other factors.

“The idea is that once we would be starting with the public procurements and auctions, then it will be a clear message to the European manufacturing industry,” Zygimantas Vaiciunas of the European Solar Manufacturing Council told Reuters.

The European Union has a target to reach 600 gigawatts of EU solar installations by 2030, about triple the level of 2022, requiring a significant acceleration of deployment. Tariffs, the group said, would only slow this down.

The signatories – comprising 425 companies, plus 28 national associations and research institutes – said they also supported efforts to reshore some solar manufacturing to reach an EU goal of 30 gigawatts of production capacity by 2025.

The European Union set limits on imports of Chinese solar panels, cells and wafers from 2013 to 2018. Now, more than 90% of PV wafers and other components come from China.

Brussels has launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles and will scrutinise foreign subsidies in the wind sector to ensure clean tech manufacturing takes place in Europe and dependence on China declines.

1143485733,20231130,"Who controls the world’s oceans? Even though this is a massive question, the answer is problematic to say the least.

It’s problematic in that the only bodies with any meaningful say in what happens to the oceans are 17 obscure organizations that are heavily focused on the management of fish as a commodity.

The problem is not simply a result of the obscurity of these bodies, called Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs, for short), or even of their near-singular focus on industrial fishing, but that these organizations can’t even manage the fisheries properly.

To a certain extent, we don’t even know what’s actually going on in the oceans – because some RFMOs conduct critical meetings in secret, or foster processes where decisions are reached secretly and informally outside of their official and public mechanisms.

Two major examples are the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), which rules over nearly 60 percent of the world’s tuna supply, and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), whose major “management success” these years has been to allow the overfishing of its three main fish stocks: mackerel, atlanto-scandian herring and blue whiting.

The case of the WCPFC, which consists of a mix of Pacific island nations combined with global fishing powerhouses like China, Japan, the US, and the European Union, involves its island nations bloc insisting on having its key compliance discussions in secret, while its leaders complain about accusations of secrecy.

As the WCPFC’s Technical and Compliance Committee gathered in late September in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, its chair, Dr. Josie Tamate of the nation of Niue, said to the delegates: “There are those on the outside who are looking for ways to question what we do. There are also comments that the WCPFC is working in secret. We all know that is not true because our work is guided by the processes and systems we have established over years.”

Minutes later, it was announced that the NGO observers, a number of whom had traveled several days to reach the meeting location, would be excluded for a secret portion of the meeting that would last for three days.

In the Northeast Atlantic, fisheries management secrecy takes a different, and potentially more destructive form, as evidenced by the poor sustainability levels when it comes to mackerel, herring and blue whiting.

Indeed, NEAFC generally allows its most sensitive decisions to be made through its “Coastal States Consultations,” ad hoc meetings consisting of the states involved in the fishery where these states make decisions. States involved in these consultations are Iceland, Norway, the Faroes Islands, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Greenland and the Russian Federation.

The Coastal States consultations actually lack any formalized framework, meaning that, among other missing items, any explicit requirements for openness and transparency are lacking and totally depends on the goodwill of the states involved.

Observer participation in these consultations is virtually non-existent, because of the informal nature of the governance process and because the policy decisions are difficult even for veteran fisheries journalists and other experts to monitor or track.

Even within NEAFC’s formal activities, barriers to meaningful NGO observer participation are formidable. Only NGOs with “good standing” in the eyes of NEAFC are eligible to apply. NGO observer access is limited to the NEAFC annual general meeting, and to only one of its three permanent committees (the Permanent Committee on Management and Science, PECMAS).

No access is offered to its other two committees, its three permanent working groups, or to any of its ad hoc working groups. The only exceptions are made if observers are approved by consensus, and then only on a case-by-case basis. The situation slightly evolved since the last annual meeting held from 14-17 November this year when NEAFC countries reluctantly accepted at the last minute to open a key working group to observers, following a big push from NGOs.

But in return for being allowed into a NEAFC meeting, observers must agree to abide by policies that restrict them from making recordings, issuing press releases or other information to the media, or using social media to publish information on agenda items under discussion. These restrictions go well beyond those required of NGO observers in other international meetings.

Aside from the implications of secrecy on the ability by countries to monitor and maintain the health of the world’s fisheries themselves, the governance issues baked into the RFMO system do not bode well for involving the broader range of stakeholders interested in the management of the oceans , especially those who want to progress on achieving the interlinked internationally-agreed objectives of sustainable fisheries and biodiversity protection.

A more mature governance approach for RFMOs could allow them to evolve into bodies capable of a more ambitious oceans management role, and potentially alleviate the need for a complicated and time-consuming task of creating an alternative structure for oceans governance.

But the continuing resistance of key RFMOs to treating stakeholders with even basic evenhandedness does not augur well. The one missing element is that RFMOs have been able to shield themselves through their collective obscurity as well as their obsessive secrecy, and that their member states and even most NGOs have been content to allow them to do so.

This needs to change. Increasing the transparency of RFMOs is a prerequisite for better fisheries management, and a critical requirement if the RFMO system is to evolve into a viable basis for a more holistic approach to oceans management."

The launch of a climate ""loss and damage"" fund drew praise and hundreds of millions of dollars in pledges at the UN's COP28 talks on Thursday but also warnings that much more is needed to help vulnerable nations.

""We have delivered history today,"" the UAE's COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber told delegates who stood and applauded after the decision's adoption in Dubai.

The announcement was followed immediately by financial pledges, including 225 million euros ($246 million) from the European Union, $100 million from the United Arab Emirates, another $100 million from Germany, $40 million from Britain, $17.5 million from the United States and $10 million from Japan.

After years of dragging their feet on the issue, wealthy nations backed the fund in a landmark agreement at the COP27 summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, last year.

Its launch on the first day of COP28 follows fraught negotiations on the mechanics of the fund, which will be housed at the World Bank on an interim basis.

""This sends a positive signal of momentum to the world,"" Jaber said.

He said it was ""the first time a decision has been adopted on day one of any COP and the speed in which we have done so is also unique, phenomenal and historic.""

""This is evidence that we can deliver. COP28 can and will deliver,"" he added.

But the money pledged so far fall well short of the $100 billion that developing nations -- which have historically been least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions -- have said are needed to cover losses from natural disasters.

""The progress we've made in establishing a loss and damage fund is hugely significant for climate justice, but an empty fund can't help our people,"" said Madeleine Diouf Sarr, chair of the Group of the 46 Least Developed Countries.

The Alliance of Small Island States -- among the most impacted by rising seas and other effects of climate change -- said ""the work is far from over"".

""We cannot rest until this fund is adequately financed and starts to actually alleviate the burden of vulnerable communities,"" it said.

""Success starts when the international community can properly support the victims of this climate crisis, with efficient, direct access to the finance they urgently need,"" the group added.

Rachel Cleetus, policy director of the climate and energy programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the financial commitments should be ""in the billions, not millions"".

""Millions would be an insult given what's happening already around the world,"" Cleetus told reporters.

""We want to hear the starting point is a conversation about billions and then a plan to scale it up by 2030 so that it meets the needs that are clearly rising,"" she said.

The fund will be housed in the World Bank for four years, a decision that developing nations begrudgingly accepted as the Washington-based institution is dominated by Western powers.

Its board members must now be appointed and represent wealthy and developing nations, and their first steps will be critical in building up its credibility.

A European diplomat said the first contributions will enable the financing of pilot projects and to test how the fund works before seeking more money ""in a year or a year-and-a-half"".

Developed countries, the US chief among them, insisted that contributions be on a voluntary basis, and want richer emerging powers such as China and Saudi Arabia to open their wallets, too.

US climate envoy John Kerry said the government would work with Congress to provide the $17.5 million pledge and said the US expects the fund to ""draw from a wide variety of sources"".

Richard Sherman, the South African co-chair of the committee that oversaw negotiations, acknowledged that ""the outcome might not be satisfactory to all people.

Baku and Yerevan have been locked in a decades-long conflict for control of Azerbaijan’s formerly Armenian-populated Karabakh region, which Baku recaptured in a lightning offensive in September.

Internationally-mediated peace talks between the Caucasus neighbours have failed to produce a breakthrough — but both countries’ leaders have said that a comprehensive peace deal could be signed by the end of the year.

The peace process stalled however, after Azerbaijan recently refused meetings under the mediation of the European Union and United States, accusing them of favouring Armenia.

On Thursday, Armenian and Azerbaijani “commissions on border delimitation, chaired by Armenian Vice Prime Minister Mher Grigoryan and his Azerbaijani counterpart Shahin Mustafayev, began a fifth round of talks,” Grigoryan’s spokeswoman Ani Babayan told AFP.

The meeting “is taking place at Ijevan-Gazakh sector of the state border,” she added.

Last week, Azerbaijani foreign ministry said Baku “stands prepared for direct negotiations with Armenia on a bilateral basis to finalise the peace agreement as soon as possible.”

In a one-day military operation on September 19, Azerbaijan recaptured Karabakh from Armenian separatists who had controlled the mountainous enclave for three decades.

Almost the entire Armenian population of the region — more than 100,000 people — fled Karabakh over the following days for Armenia, sparking a refugee crisis.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev have met on several occasions for talks under the mediation of the European Union.

But last month, Aliyev refused to attend negotiations with Pashinyan in Spain, citing French bias.

Washington had also organised several meetings between the countries’ foreign ministries.

Azerbaijan however refused further talks, due to what it says is Washington’s “biased” position.

1143515285,20231130,"PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovo’s government on Thursday postponed a deadline by two weeks for ethnic Serbs living in the country to register their vehicles with Kosovo license plates instead of Serbian ones.

The move was made to give ethnic Serbs more time to comply with the order. The deadline was initially set for Friday, but has been moved to Dec. 15.

The program has financial incentives, including the waiving of taxes and the registration fee. After the deadline passes, old number plates would be considered illegal, and violators would first be fined and then have their vehicles towed if they didn’t subsequently abide by the new rules.

In recent days, Associated Press journalists have seen scores of ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo lining up to register their vehicles. Authorities say that about 3,000 vehicles out of an estimated 4,000 ones have been registered so far.

The issue of vehicle registration has sparked tensions in the past. Vehicle registration was one of the reasons why ethnic Serb municipal, judicial and police officials in four northern municipalities resigned their posts last year to protest a decision by Kosovo’s government to ban Serbia-issued vehicle license plates.

No official reason has been given for the recent change in attitudes among ethnic Serbs in being more willing to accept Kosovo license plates this time around.

Tensions in the north and with neighboring Serbia remain tense, especially after a deadly gunbattle on Sept. 24 when about 30 Serb gunmen clashed with Kosovo police, leaving a Kosovar officer and three Serb gunmen dead.

European Union-facilitated talks on normalizing their ties is at a stalemate.

Kosovo unilaterally broke away from Serbia and declared independence in 2008, a move that Belgrade has refused to recognize.

The 1998-1999 war between Serbia and Kosovo killed about 13,000 people, mostly Kosovo Albanians. It ended after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign that compelled Serbian forces to withdraw from Kosovo."

BNBC has outperformed its operational plans, Uritsky disclosed, estimating that the company exports 85% of production volume, though Western sanctions pushed the company to alter its export plans.

“We thought we would export 20% of our products to Europe and the Middle East. After the sanctions were imposed, logistics changed, and we increased exports to Russia,” Uritsky stated. He also estimated that BNBC managed to meet 100% of the demand in the Belarussian feed market.

In 2019, BNBC unveiled a target to meet 5% to 10% of the demand for amino acids in the European Union market in the foreseeable future. The company reported that it had already concluded preliminary agreements with big European customers before the production was launched.

However, Western sanctions imposed against the country in several rounds in 2020 and 2022 have barred the way for BNBC additives to Europe.

“If we grow grain and sell it for $150 per ton, it seems to be a good business. But, if we make tryptophane from it, we can sell it for $10,000 [per ton],” Uritsky asserted.

At the second stage, the company planned to add capacities for feed vitamins production. Uritsky, however, said that the imminent plans are to begin production of some food additives and medical goods.

“These are new types of essential amino acids, new products from the category of vitamins, say, and components that can be used in medicine,” Uritsky said.

To fuel BNBC expansion plans, the Belarussian government expanded the company’s land bank. The authorities have recently transferred agricultural land of several districts of the Minsk region under BNBC management."

“This humanitarian aid will address the urgent needs of the most affected families in some of the hardest-hit districts in the eastern region of Visayas,” the EU Delegation to Manila said in a statement.

The combined effects of Shearline and Low Pressure Area killed at least two people and affected around 1.15 million Filipinos in Calabarzon, Bicol, Eastern Visayas, Central Visayas, Western Visayas and Caraga regions, according to the National Disaster Coordinating Council.

Among the seven regions, the Eastern Visayas was hit most with 123 areas flooded. The amount of rain recorded in Catarman, Northern Samar on November 20 has reached 618 mm, above the 450 mm normal monthly average. This record surpasses tropical storm Ondoy’s 24-hour rainfall in 2012 which was 455 mm.

The massive floods inundated rice fields and other agricultural products, the damage is estimated to be around P120 million. Floodwaters also contaminated natural water sources in the affected areas.

“The floods have caused massive destruction that affects hundreds of thousands of people in the Philippines.

“To help, the EU immediately channels funding to support our partners to scale up their efforts in delivering essential aid to the affected families,” Arlynn Aquino, who oversees the EU’s humanitarian programs in the Philippines, said.

EU has humanitarian partners already on the ground delivering vital aid. This P18 million financial aid will support these partners in delivering food and livelihood support, clean water supplies, sanitation facilities and education, the EU delegation said.

The European Commission’s Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations department is providing the funding to the EU Delegation.

It was also Eastern Visayas that was most badly hit when super typhoon Yolanda (international name Haiyan) struck, also in November 10 years ago, killing thousands and flattening communities with storm surges."

The Government of Georgia convened the Rural Development Conference to enhance policy reforms and foster coordination, bringing together national stakeholders, international partners, and rural development experts from EU Member States.

 Georgia’s Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture hosted this high-level forum with funding from the European Union and in cooperation with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

 Otar Shamugia, Minister of Environmental Protection and Agriculture of Georgia, and Catalin Gherman, Deputy Head of the Cooperation Section at the Delegation of the European Union to Georgia, opened a discussion by highlighting the indispensable role of rural development in driving Georgia’s regions forward, improving the well-being of its people, and facilitating a seamless transition to a greener economy.

 “Georgia has made significant strides in the last decade through rural development programs, institutional reforms, and the adoption of European approaches. As we draw closer to the European Union, our objective is to build on these achievements, working with partners to set rural development priorities and design interventions aligning with the EU Common Agricultural Policy,” noted Minister Shamugia.

 “Sustainable and green rural development will improve the lives of over 40% of Georgians living outside major cities, fostering opportunities for entrepreneurship, education, and environmental protection,” Catalin Gherman noted. “With support from the European Union, Georgia made notable progress in institutional reforms aimed at aligning its rural development frameworks with the EU Common Agricultural Policy. We remain committed to working with the government, civil society, the private sector, and communities on this developmental journey. One of the most important components in this context is the EU’s LEADER program—a bottom-up initiative designed to bolster the growth of rural areas by implementing projects that directly address local needs. We look forward to the forthcoming implementation of the established mechanism in Georgia, facilitating state financing for rural development projects spurred by LEADER initiatives.”

The Rural Development Conference featured insightful panel discussions involving Georgian and European officials, practitioners, and experts. Key topics included policy frameworks for sustainable rural development and agriculture, harmonization of Georgian policies with the EU Common Agriculture Policy, the transition to a greener economy in line with the EU’s Green Deal, digital solutions for monitoring and control systems, and funding mechanisms available for EU membership candidate countries.

 Experts from Austria, Italy, Latvia, Serbia, and North Macedonia shared their countries’ experiences implementing the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy and the Instrument of Pre-Accession Assistance in Rural Development (IPARD).

 Summarizing the conference outcomes, Douglas Webb, UNDP Resident Representative a.i. in Georgia, underscored its significance as a step toward equitable rural development. “Georgia has every opportunity to foster vibrant rural economies that benefit the people and contribute to the country’s prosperity. Our goal is to empower rural communities by ensuring sustained attention from decision-makers, that engages the private sector and civil society, and harnesses best practices from European countries.”

1143527305,20231130,"Israel has released another group of Palestinian prisoners on Friday, hours after Hamas freed additional Israeli hostages under a last-minute agreement to extend their ceasefire by another day in Gaza.

During the truce, at least 10 Israelis a day, along with other nationals, have been freed by Hamas in return for Israel's release of at least 30 Palestinian prisoners a day.

The truce began on November 24 and was expected to last four-days, but was extended by two days on Monday, before this latest one-day extension.

Hamas's armed wing has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed at least three people in Jerusalem, citing Israel's attack on Gaza and the escalating violence from settlers in the West Bank.

Here are the latest developments:
• Two hostages released from Gaza, more expected to come
• Negotiators seek two day extension with cease fire set to expire
• Israel recalls Spanish envoy after Spanish PM remarks about Israeli incursion into Gaza

Israel's military said six more Israeli hostages held in Gaza were handed over to the Red Cross and were on their way to Israeli territory, bringing the total released on Thursday to eight.

They were brought to Israel for medical evaluations and to be reunited with their families, the Israeli military said.

A busload of 30 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel was welcomed home in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Dozens of men, some holding green Hamas flags, greeted the prisoners. The men were hugged as the crowd chanted, ""God is great"".

Asked why Hamas on Thursday released fewer than the 10 hostages outlined in the ceasefire agreement, the military’s chief spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, noted that 12 Israeli citizens had been released the day before, implying that the overall total had met Israeli demands.

Earlier on Thursday, Hamas handed over two female hostages to the Red Cross.

Israel named the freed hostages as 21-year-old Mia Schem, who was taken at a dance party along with many of the other hostages abducted into Gaza, and 40-year-old Amit Soussana.

The warring sides had agreed to extend their ceasefire for a seventh day, while mediators pressed on with talks to extend the truce further to free more hostages and let aid reach Gaza.

Earlier, Israel, which has demanded Hamas release at least 10 hostages per day to hold the ceasefire, said it received a list at the last minute of those who would go free on Thursday, allowing it to call off plans to resume fighting at dawn.

Hamas, which freed 16 hostages on Wednesday while Israel released 30 Palestinian prisoners, also said the truce would continue for a seventh day.

Mia Schem had appeared in a hostage video released by Hamas in October which showed her injured arm being treated by an unidentified medical worker.

The video showed Ms Schem embracing her mother and brother after they were reunited at Hatzerim military base in Israel.

Her father David told Israel's Channel 12 TV on Thursday that when they meet, he will not say a word to her. ""I don't want to ask her questions, because I don't know what she endured.""

Other newly released hostages included a brother and sister, Belal and Aisha al-Ziadna, aged 18 and 17 respectively, according to the Israeli prime minister's office.

They are Bedouin Arab citizens of Israel and among four members of their family taken hostage while they were milking cows on a farm.

Egypt's state media body said Egyptian and Qatari mediators were working to negotiate a further extension of the truce for two days.

So far militants have released 97 hostages during the truce: 70 Israeli women, teenagers and children, each freed in return for three Palestinian women and teenage detainees, plus 27 foreign hostages freed under parallel agreements with their governments.

With fewer Israeli women and children left in captivity, extending the truce could require setting new terms for the release of Israeli men, including soldiers.

Hamas's armed Al-Qassam Brigades wing has claimed responsibility for a gun attack in Jerusalem that killed at least three people, in a statement posted on Hamas's channel on social media platform Telegram.

The attack saw two Palestinians open fire at a bus stop during morning rush hour at the entrance to Jerusalem, killing at least three people.

Both attackers were ""neutralised"", police said.

The two gunmen were shot dead after the attack by ""two off-duty IDF soldiers and another civilian who fired at them"", police said in a statement.

""This event proves again how we must not show weakness, that we must speak to Hamas only through [rifle] scopes, only through war,"" said hard-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir at the site of the attack.

Hamas said the attack was a ""natural response to the unprecedented crimes of the occupier in the Gaza Strip and against children in Jenin"" in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

But neither side appeared to treat the attack as an explicit renunciation of the truce.

A Palestinian official familiar with the truce talks said its terms did not apply to what he characterised as responses to Israeli attacks in the West Bank and Jerusalem.

Israel and Hamas agreed to add a seventh day of a humanitarian pause on Thursday, while Egyptian and Qatari mediators were working to negotiate a further extension of two days, Egypt's official state media agency said.

Thus far during the truce, Palestinian militants have freed 105 hostages and Israel has released 240 Palestinian prisoners.

With fewer Israeli women and children left in captivity, extending the truce could require setting new terms for the release of Israeli men, including soldiers.

The truce has allowed some humanitarian aid into Gaza after much of the coastal territory of 2.3 million people was reduced to wasteland in the Israeli assault.

More fuel and 56 trucks of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza on Thursday, Israel's defence ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said.

But deliveries of food, water, medical supplies and fuel remain far below what is needed, aid workers say. At an emergency meeting in Amman, Jordan's King Abdullah on Thursday urged UN officials and international groups to pressure Israel to allow more aid into the beleaguered enclave, according to delegates.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Israel during his third visit to the Middle East since the war began, agreed that the flow of aid into Gaza was not sufficient.

Mr Blinken said he told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel must do more to protect civilians before any further military operations, and Mr Netanyahu and his cabinet supported this approach.

""Israel has … one of the most sophisticated militaries in the world. It is capable of neutralising the threat posed by Hamas while minimising harm to innocent men, women and children. And it has an obligation to do so,"" Mr Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv.

Israel summoned the Spanish ambassador for a reprimand and recalled its own envoy from Madrid for consultations after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez questioned the legality of Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip.

Mr Sanchez said on Thursday that given the number of casualties among civilians in Gaza, he doubts Israel is respecting international humanitarian law during an interview with Spanish public broadcaster TVE.

""The footage we are seeing and the growing numbers of children dying, I have serious doubt [Israel] is complying with international humanitarian law,"" he said.

Mr Sanchez said during the interview that the European Union should recognise a Palestinian state to ""stabilise the region"".

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed his foreign minister Eli Cohen to call in Spain's ambassador for a reprimand ""after the shameful statement by the Spanish prime minister on the same day that Hamas terrorists are murdering Israelis in our capital Jerusalem,"" referring to the attack in which two gunmen killed at least three people at a bus stop.

In a social media post on X, Mr Cohen said, ""I have decided to summon the Israeli ambassador in Spain for consultations in Jerusalem.

""Israel conducts itself and will continue to conduct itself in accordance with international law,"" Mr Cohen said."

1143542904,20231130,"While climate leaders are gathering at COP28, Sunfire’s Tilo Suckow is on a mission to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.

Tilo Suckow is head of sustainability at renewable energy company Sunfire, so he is particularly well placed to tell us about the transition toward green energy and mobility. Before joining Sunfire, he had a stint at EY as a sustainability consultant, before going onto a role as project manager at the non-profit organisation World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

The latter, he says, really opened his eyes to the breadth of crises faced by the planet due to the climate crisis. “When I moved from EY to WWF I was now exposed, in this NGO world, to the crises that we as humanity face, and I also learned more about the extent of the impact that we as humans have on our planet, and on those life-providing systems on earth,” says Suckow.

“Until then, I was more or less focused on climate change and on how we can reduce our global carbon footprint, but then I also learned that the climate crisis very much increases pressure on biodiversity loss, and so at the WWF, I focused a lot on the impact of our eating habits, the carbon footprint of our global food system, right through to the other transitions required like the energy transition, how we cool and heat our buildings, and the mobility transition, how we travel.

“So there’s multitude of crises and challenges. And I decided that I want to not only spend my personal life trying to reduce my personal footprint, but I also in my professional life wanted to increase my professional handprint in a way that I’m contributing meaningfully to positive change in this world for the better.”

Suckow’s ecological conscience was pricked even before this, growing up in a region south of Berlin that was very much dependent on brown coal, he saw his grandparents’ village “eaten up” by brown coal extraction.

“I was living in a bigger town close by of about 100,000 people, and half of my family was also dependent and co-dependent on those fossil fuel jobs, some of them literally worked for the very power plant that basically ate up my grandparents’ village. So, I was a little bit ambivalent, and our whole family was about that.

“As a teen, I started to realise that every kilowatt hour, and every product we consume that is being produced comes at some environmental cost, and those are often invisible to us as the end customer.”

Unsurprisingly, when he later studied for a degree in business administration and engineering, his focus was on environmental technology, leading to his role at EY, where he helped clients develop and set up effective sustainability management systems and ESG reporting.

After WWF, Suckow says the move to the head of sustainability role at Sunfire was an obvious next step. “After consultancy and advisory roles at EY and WWF, I wanted to develop myself further, and wanted to be actually responsible for implementing things and measures in the company that, prior to Sunfire, I had only advised on. Plus, Sunfire’s credo, its vision of ‘creating a world without fossil fuels’ very much resonated with my personal values.”

Sunfire is a company that produces electrolysers, machines that basically separate water into hydrogen and oxygen. And if they do that using electricity that is renewable, generated by wind, solar or another renewable energy source, then the hydrogen that comes out of the electrolyser is known as green hydrogen, Suckow explains.

Suckow’s role at Sunfire has two core aspects: sustainability reporting and sustainability performance, as Sunfire aims to walk the talk when it comes to its own internal processes.

“We as a company, already have to disclose non-financial sustainability information to our investors, to the general public, to whoever is interested, for regulatory reasons. And we will have to do so publicly in the upcoming years as we grow as a company and as regulatory requirements for such disclosures arise. It’s not just about measuring your footprint as a company and measuring the status quo, how is sustainability at Sunfire at the point X in time, but it’s also about really improving and increasing our sustainability performance as a whole.”

He is relishing the challenge, as he believes sustainability reporting is going to become ever more developed as a corporate function in coming years. “The whole aspect of ESG [environmental, social and governance] and sustainability as a whole, has become more and more a must-have for corporates. And it’s not just about regulatory requirements anymore. Your investors and your clients will want to ensure that their investments, or the products that they’re buying from you are produced in the most sustainable way possible.”

He is proud that Sunfire and its technology is an enabler for many of these large industrial companies to transform their business models, to transition from fossil fuel based business model to a more renewable one, from a linear consumption business model to a circular one.

Returning to green hydrogen, which many see as the great beacon of hope for the energy transition, I ask Suckow if he believes it holds the promise many think it does.

“Green hydrogen is a game changer because hydrogen can do so many things. Hydrogen is not new. However, there is already a lot of hydrogen demand out there in the world economy, but it’s fossil fuel based. So there’s a huge potential to really replace that fossil fuel-based hydrogen with renewable hydrogen. There’s one big climate impact right there, getting rid of all these emissions.

“Then hydrogen as a molecule is very versatile, you can use it in chemical products. It’s part of basically every fuel that there is, which gives green hydrogen the opportunity to actually create green fuels, sustainable biofuels, for instance, or fuel for long-haul shipping. You basically have those hydrogen molecules and pair them up with carbon molecules that have been ideally extracted from the atmosphere or have somehow been captured from a new renewable source. And then you just do some chemical magic with it. And then you end up with sustainable fuels right there.

“They can be used in sectors that are really hard to transform any other way. We are not going to have all the air fleet that is out flying on batteries. The same with same with ships. So green hydrogen has a huge potential to decarbonise these sectors.”

Suckow sees it as a “once in a century opportunity”, and he says it is vital that the European Union supports this upcoming green hydrogen economy. “This is a market that is rapidly developing all over the world. The global total installed capacity of electrolysis is just a couple of 100 megawatts. And in the EU alone, it needs to be 100 gigawatts at least by 2030, at least that’s the political target.

“So, you see what the magnitude of the scaling challenge is just by the sheer numbers. We need to increase it more than 100-fold in the next seven years, just in Europe. That is a huge opportunity, but also a huge challenge.”

Many point to cost when it comes to producing green hydrogen, but Suckow says this is just a matter of time. “If you think back at the cost of producing renewables initially, the economies of scale will produce the same picture with green hydrogen, the costs of green hydrogen are going to fall as we scale.”

The political will and support must be there, however, says Suckow, and there is no time for bureaucracy. “The challenge I would see, is the sheer scale of production capacity increase required. Sunfire is one of the few companies that are already capable of delivering industrialised hydrogen production electrolysers on a big scale. Plus, green hydrogen, by definition requires renewable energy, and every additional electrolyser would need additional green electricity generation capacity. So both have to go hand in hand in order to make this whole thing happen.”

So, the battle to increase renewable energy production remains hugely relevant to any green hydrogen revolution, if we are to grasp this “once in a century” opportunity.

1143547219,20231130,"There is more trouble for Sunak, writes Eddie Ford, with record net figures - much to the anger and consternation of the Tory right

Things are just getting worse and worse for Rishi Sunak, who is facing a growing rebellion from the right of his party - especially on the “totemic” issue of immigration. The latest bad news for the prime minister comes with the net migration figures from the Office for National Statistics, which showed a record 745,000 coming to the UK in 2022 - three times higher than the level before Brexit.

But, as always, the devil lies in the detail. What needs to be emphasised about these figures is what has driven them - Ukrainians, Hong Kongers, people from the Indian sub-continent and elsewhere coming to fill low-paid jobs, particularly in the NHS and the care sector. However, provisional data for the year ending in June 2023 shows a lower net migration figure of 672,000, after 1.2 million people came to live in the UK for at least a year, and 508,000 left for sunnier climes. Though this was a year-on-year increase of 65,000 from the previous time period, it has led to speculation among statisticians that net migration may actually be on a downward trend - something that was drowned out by the hue and cry coming from the rightwing press and MPs, especially on the Tory back benches. But you cannot expect such people to grapple with statistical complexity or swim against the tide of right populism and national chauvinism.

Naturally, the ONS cautioned that its estimates could be revised again - whether upward or downward, given that migration patterns are currently quite volatile. Anyhow, the vast majority (968,000) arriving were from countries outside the European Union, with students accounting for the largest group of non-EU migrants (263,000). Then there were 322,000 work-related visas issued for this period, up from 198,000 in the year to June 2022 - nearly two-thirds went to Indian, Nigerian and Zimbabwean nationals, replacing EU workers in sectors of the economy that are struggling to recruit staff since Brexit. Then again, what do you expect when you have Sunak boasting about how successful he has been in keeping wages down in the public sector, forcing workers to look for other jobs to maintain living standards - hence the 132,000 NHS and 152,000 adult care sector vacancies.

Separate home office visa and asylum data showed there was little change in the total number of people seeking asylum in the UK - at 76,000 for the year ending in September 2023. There were 56,042 people in hotel accommodation. In the same time period, 25,000 people reached the UK in small boats, compared with 33,000 in the previous period.

Quick as a flash, regardless of what the ONS figures might actually say, former home secretary Suella Braverman described the numbers as a “slap in the face” to the British people, who have “voted to control and reduce migration at every opportunity”, In order to combat the “unsustainable” pressure on public services, she has called for an annual cap on net migration, closing the graduate visa route and placing a cap on health and social care visas. According to her, “Brexit gave us the tools” and now “it’s time to use them” - though what exactly she means by that is slightly mysterious.

Of course, the row presents a perfect opportunity for her to advance her obvious ambition to become the Tory right’s most prominent spokesperson and then party leader when Sunak falls on his sword after the near inevitable general election defeat next year. As part of this plan, she was quickly elevated to the status of a rightwing martyr after she got what she wanted and was sacked by Rishi Sunak for her various incendiary comments that delighted narrowminded bigots everywhere - the crunch possibly coming with the mad (but calculated) remark about Met Police “bias” towards the left and pro-Palestine demonstrators.

Indeed, in a bid to increase her profile on the right, Braverman has repeatedly threatened to release documents showing that Sunak had agreed to policy demands on migration before she backed him to become prime minister after the rapid collapse of Liz Truss’s government. Coming to her assistance, The Daily Telegraph says it has a copy of the deal, which pledged to increase the minimum salary for a skilled worker arriving in the UK from £26,000 to £40,000, as well as ending extended visas for graduates, further limiting family members people can bring, and prioritising certain universities for student visas.

Naturally, No10 has denied any formal plan and they might well be right - maybe some deliberate wishful thinking on the part of Braverman. But Kemi Badenoch, business secretary - another person on the hard right with leadership ambitions - hinted at the beginning of the week that the salary threshold could be increased anyway as part of “much, much tougher measures” that are supposedly being drawn up.

With Tory dissatisfaction bubbling over, this week immigration minister Robert Jenrick appeared to distance himself from Rishi Sunak. It is widely reported that Jenrick - once seen as someone close to the prime minister - has presented his own five-point plan to No10, with Sunak looking more and more isolated, if not besieged. Answering an urgent question in the Commons about whether his plan would be in place before Christmas, he craftily replied: “My plan would have been brought to the house before last Christmas if I could have done, but let’s hope we can bring forward a substantive package of reforms very quickly”. As you would expect, former cabinet ministers Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Simon Clarke have also been very vocal in calling for more action to bring down migration.

Running out of patience, the New Conservatives group of diehard rightwing MPs said the migration issue was “do or die” for the party - issuing a statement saying that “each of us made a promise to the electorate” that cannot be ignored. In a rightwing pincer move, the Common Sense Group has written to Sunak pressing for “urgent” action on legal migration numbers, and seeking assurances that a promised bill to overcome the supreme court’s rejection of the Rwanda plan is a “belt and braces affair” that can resist future legal challenges (that is, it can “disapply” some or all of the human rights law - international and domestic - on which that judgment was founded). This letter was triggered by recent remarks from the new home secretary, James Cleverly, urging people not to “fixate” on the government’s Rwanda deportation plan or “prejudge” the content of emergency legislation on the scheme.

This did not go down well with many Conservative MPs, furthering reinforcing the impression that the prime minister is not going fast and far enough on immigration - that he is not really serious about the issue. Writing in The Guardian, the often perceptive centre-right journalist, Rafael Behr - long ago disillusioned with a Tory Party that has become too ‘unconservative’ - argued that Rwanda is “a proxy in the war for the Tory soul” and “it’s a war Rishi Sunak is losing” (November 29). A pantomime show for a party heading to defeat.

Both the New Conservatives and the Common Sense Group want the government to come out with an immediate plan to reduce migration before the general election. But this seems very unlikely for the simple reason that the Commons recess is due to begin on December 19 and therefore - at least in theory - there are not enough sitting days to ratify a new treaty with Rwanda before the new year under the current schedule, No10 stating that at least 21 days are required. How very convenient, some might say.

You can see why the right is up in arms over migration - and the general drift of the Sunak government - because it is a living symbol of failure. Back in 2010, David Cameron made the laughable pledge as prime minister to reduce net migration to “tens of thousands” - clearly a fantasy figure, as many people observed at the time. In fact, perhaps because Dodgy Dave could not deliver the undeliverable, we saw the result we did with Brexit. Theresa May too promised to bring net migration down to under 100,000 a year. In some respects, Sunak has made a similar albatross for himself in the form of small boats. Everyone knows, including himself, that he will not “stop the boats” carrying asylum-seekers across the Channel, even if we are talking about very small beer indeed, compared to the numbers coming legally.

Yet the Tories are still caught in that bind from which there is no escape. Yes, the party’s post-Brexit 2019 manifesto vowed that “overall numbers will come down” and “we will ensure that the British people are always in control” - but without setting a specific target or any concrete plan of action. The ONS has painfully reminded them that no progress has been made. Quite the opposite, if anything. No wonder the Tory right is going through an existentialist crisis. It appears that the government is considering measures to reduce net migration, including limiting to one the number of relatives that health and social care workers are allowed to bring with them, abolishing the system allowing employers to pay less where there are recognised shortages and - as demanded by Suella Braverman - raising the minimum salary threshold for work visas. But it is all desperate stuff that is not going to work, even if the government tries to implement any of these measures before they are thrown out by the electorate.

Totally predictably, Sir Keir Starmer thundered about how the “shockingly high” net migration represented “a failure not just of immigration, but also of asylum and of the economy” - the obvious inference being that Labour would crack down harder on migration than the weakling Tories. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the treasury, claimed that a Labour government would cut net migration to “normal levels” of a “couple of hundred thousand a year” within its first term. This sounds like another hostage to fortune, though he did add a qualification to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg by saying Labour “probably would hope to do that”, but, remember, “we’ve talked about a decade of national renewal”, as it would take “some time to fix the deep structural problems” left by successive Conservative governments. At least he left himself a get-out clause, unlike David Cameron.

Rishi Sunak is a prisoner of his own policies. Unsurprisingly, the prime minister, backed by his new foreign secretary, Cameron, and his home secretary, James Cleverly, is believed to be very reluctant to give in to demands to block human rights laws, so that asylum-seekers can be sent to Rwanda. That would obviously undermine Britain’s standing as a law-abiding member of the ‘international community’, making it a lot harder for him and his ministers to lecture the likes of Valdimir Putin on the sanctity of the post-World War II international architecture.

There is also the fact that pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights, which the right dearly wants, could potentially sabotage the Good Friday agreement - Rishi Sunak having sweated blood over the Windsor framework. The same goes for the Rwanda scheme - the prime minister looking for some magical way of drafting a bill that sees the UK abiding by its international obligations, whilst at the same time also giving anti-ECHR Tory backbenchers what they want. An impossible trick, because you cannot hoodwink Suella Braverman and her fellow thinkers, who will always come back for more red meat, no matter how much you concede to their demands (as Brexit taught us).

No10 is also very aware that there could be a significant backlash if they did actually succeed somehow in reducing the numbers coming perfectly legally to Britain. As the ONS shows us, many of the arrivals have come to work in the NHS and care homes - so chucking lots of them out would only intensify the crisis in those sectors and make a lot of people even more unhappy with the Tory government, including potential voters. Similarly with the international student numbers. Clamping down on student visas could harm the finances of universities, which use overseas fees to cross-subsidise the studies of UK students.

That is something else that would seriously upset people in the run-up to a general election - how smart would that be?"

Keshet 12who has the record.

Blinken is said to have noted that there are currently two million Palestinians in southern Gaza, with almost the entire population of the north having fled there. “You have to evacuate more people from their homes, attack more precisely, not hit UN buildings and make sure there are enough protected areas,” Blinken said of the next phase of the war. ‘And if that doesn’t work?’ Then do not attack places where civilians are present.

Blinken also urged the Israelis to accelerate their war goal of destroying Hamas in Gaza. Defense Minister Yoav Galant said that Israeli society stands behind this goal, “even if it takes months.” “I don’t think you take credit for that,” Blinken responded.

During the meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke against the idea of ​​the Palestinian Authority controlling Gaza after the war. The United States and the European Union, among others, have suggested this, but Netanyahu said the Palestinian Authority “supports, trains and finances terrorism.” Blinken expressed his understanding of Netanyahu’s position, saying: “The best way to kill an idea is to come up with a better idea.” Other countries in the region need to know what you are planning to do."

‘As a diplomat, US envoy Peter Haas has to maintain some protocols in his activities and movements. We believe that he will follow that,’ he said, responding to a question about the US envoy’s movement and possible sanctions on Bangladesh at a briefing.

He said that AL neither wanted the US envoy to support them nor any political party.

‘They [US] told us that they did not support one party over another. We want a reflection of reality,’ he added at the briefing held at AL president Sheikh Hasina’s political office in the capital’s Dhanmondi area.

Quader, also the road, transport, and bridges minister, asked why the US would impose sanctions against Bangladesh as the government was determined to hold a free, fair, and peaceful election.

‘They [BNP] are attempting to foil elections through arson. Sanctions should be imposed on whoever is foiling the elections,’ he added.

Asked about the European Union’s demand for democratic, credible, peaceful, and participatory elections, he said, ‘We also demand the same as the European Union wants.’

He claimed that the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party had no option left to be called to join the election.

‘BNP has kept no room to be urged about anything. They [BNP] made their decision and are adamant not to take part in polls. There is no space left for the BNP to run in the election,’ said Quader.

Speaking about Raushan Ershad’s decision to skip the election, Quader said it was a decision of her party, the Jatiya Party.

Quader claimed that Raushan, the leader of the opposition in parliament, would now stand beside prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

He also termed Raushan the ‘biggest advantage’ of prime minister Hasina.

Asked about the United Nations’ decision to not send any observers for the 12th parliamentary polls, Quader said that it was the choice of the United Nations.

He, however, claimed that about 100 election observer groups, including those from the US, were willing to send observers to the elections.

Quader said that there was still time for sharing seats with its alliance partners.

‘They should submit nomination papers first,’ he said.

AL presidium member Jahangir Kabir Nanak, its joint general secretary, AFM Bahauddin Nasim, and office secretary Biplab Barua, among others, were present at the briefing."

1143608057,20231201,"The talks between the United States and North Korea in Beijing ended abruptly last week after North Korean officials declared that North Korea possesses a nuclear arsenal. As the Bush Administration continues to formulate a peaceful resolution to the nuclear standoff with North Korea, it should keep in mind that its principled policy of refusing to succumb to blackmail and pursuing a multilateral approach has been, and will continue to be, the best course of action.

Although North Korea's admission seemed shocking, in reality it only confirmed what the international community has long suspected: The North Korean regime has flagrantly violated four international agreements and developed nuclear weapons. While these initial meetings did not produce any tangible results, the United States should view them as the first step in a process of aligning the interests of regional players to denuclearize North Korea peacefully.

The Bush Administration should not rule out the possibility of future talks with North Korea, as long as they are continued within a multilateral setting and the goals are well coordinated among the allies. Future talks should test whether or not Pyongyang is sincerely willing to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, recognizing that if it does so, assistance from the international community will follow. The United States should also continue to internationalize the problem by engaging the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), China, and Russia.

Recent North Korean Actions

The Beijing talks were the first between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) since October 2002, when North Korea admitted to conducting a major clandestine nuclear weapons development program. This program clearly violated both the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the 1994 Agreed Framework, which called for North Korea to freeze its nuclear program in exchange for two civilian light-water nuclear reactors and heavy fuel oil. North Korea then violated the Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards Agreement by reactivating its plutonium facility in Yongbyon and expelling IAEA monitors.

Since initiating these provocative actions, North Korea has consistently demanded face-to-face meetings with the United States, despite the Bush Administration's position that it would address North Korea only within a multilateral setting. Then, in an about-face, North Korea agreed to meet with the United States in a multilateral forum.

U.S. insistence on a multilateral resolution to North Korea's nuclear proliferation is a necessity because it is not a bilateral issue; North Korea's provocations threaten the stability of not only the region, but indeed the entire global community. Moreover, any framework to address the North's nuclear program will require, at a minimum, the participation and cooperation of North Korea's regional neighbors to ensure Pyongyang's compliance.

Goals for the Bush Administration

As the Bush Administration formulates the next steps to end the nuclear standoff with North Korea, it should consider the following actions to achieve the immediate goal: convincing North Korea that it must cease its nuclear programs, including both its plutonium-based weapons program in Yongbyon and its clandestine, highly enriched uranium program.
• Engage in active shuttle diplomacy with regional players to coordinate strategy

Although South Korea, Japan, and Russia--the other major regional powers with direct interests in resolving the nuclear issue--were not present at the meetings in Beijing, each country has some influence with North Korea. Thus, the Bush Administration should seek their support in coordinating pressure on North Korea. The Administration should also coordinate with other allies, such as Australia, Canada, and members of the European Union, that have diplomatic relations with North Korea, encouraging them to base their relations with Pyongyang on the status of its nuclear programs.
• Work with regional players to establish future meetings

South Korean officials are scheduled to meet with their North Korean counterparts in Pyongyang this week. The U.S. should encourage such meetings and use them to establish the channels of communication for future multilateral interactions between the U.S. and North Korea. South Korea should insist that North Korea abandon its nuclear programs.
• Expand future talks to include the active participation of South Korea, Japan, and Russia

The United States should make clear to North Korea and China that any permanent solution must include the active participation of the other key regional players. This is critical not only because these countries must play a crucial role in overseeing North Korea's denuclearization, but also because North Korea's strategy has long been to divide the interests of America and its allies, South Korea and Japan. Furthermore, no country has a greater interest in a peaceful resolution to tensions on the Korean peninsula than South Korea, and it must play a central role in any solution that promotes stability on the peninsula.
• Seek a United Nations resolution that condemns North Korea's violation of previous U.N. agreements

 and urges North Korea's compliance by returning to the NPT and abiding by IAEA safeguards, verifiably ceasing plutonium reprocessing at the Yongbyon facility, and ending the highly enriched uranium nuclear programs.

Conclusion

Last week's meetings in Beijing are an important, but preliminary, step toward resolving North Korea's nuclear problem peacefully. The United States should approach the road ahead with cautious optimism, keeping expectations modest.

If history is any predictor, North Korea will continue to act provocatively while simultaneously making conciliatory gestures designed to divide Washington from Seoul and Tokyo. Such behavior by Pyonyang is to be expected, but observers should not use the North's recalcitrance as the short-term measure of the Bush Administration's steadfast approach to North Korea.0 Regardless of Pyongyang's machinations to obfuscate and confuse the issues, the Bush Administration should remain focused on the long-term goal of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region.

Mr Razaaly stated this during a joint meeting with four mayors in preparation for Ghana’s participation in the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28).

The mayors included those of Accra, Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi, Ningo-Prampram, and Awutu Senya East.

“Today’s roundtable is a testament to our collective resolve in tackling climate challenges head-on. It is crucial that these local insights and experiences from Ghana were brought forth at the upcoming COP28 to ensure global climate strategies resonate with local realities,” he stated.

Mr Razaaly, highlighting the significance of the gathering, stated that 70 per cent of the emissions that cause climate change occur in cities and municipalities, and that “all municipalities in the world share the same concern.”

He noted that the meeting provided an opportunity to exchange notes and better prepare Accra’s Mayor, who is representing all West African cities at COP28, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The meeting also examined what the EU was presently doing jointly with Ghana to effectively address the issue of climate change adaptation.

He stated that the EU and its Member States were the leaders in climate financing, spending 40 billion Euros globally to meet adaptation and mitigation activities.

The EU, according to the Ambassador, aspires to cut its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030 and has asked the world’s largest economies to join the effort.

The roundtable was as part of the EU Climate Diplomacy Week, aimed at addressing the pressing issue of climate Change challenges amid rising urbanization and population growth.

The European Union Climate Change Diplomacy Week is part of the EU and its Member States’ annual global drive to strengthen cooperation on climate change and inspire genuine action.

The 2023 COP28, which will be held from November 30 to December 12, at the Expo City, Dubai, is aimed at promoting the use of carbon pricing as a cost-effective tool to reduce emissions and raise revenue to finance the green transition.

It would also urge governments to move forward with the implementation of loss and damage financing mechanisms, including the establishment of a fund.

Ms Elizabeth Sackey, the Mayor of Accra said, “this roundtable has been a powerful platform for us to unite our voices and concerns.”

“As we approach COP28, it is clear that the challenges we face in Accra are shared by many, and together, we can advocate for meaningful global action and support” she said.

Other participants at the roundtable included Ms Anita Love Obo Amissah, Municipal Chief Executive of Awutu-Senya East Municipality, Mr Yohane Amarh Ashitey, Mayor of Tema Metropolitan Assembly, Mr Innocent Haligah, Metropolitan Coordinating Director, Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolitan Assembly and Mr Al-Latiff Tetteh Amanor, District Chief Executive of Ningo-Prampram District Assembly.

The mayors are members of the Covenant of Mayors in Sub-Saharan Africa (CoM SSA) initiative, which recognises the urgency and importance of collaborating to find sustainable solutions.

The mayors intend to implement comprehensive strategies to combat climate change at the local level.

These includes a focus on sustainable urban planning, green infrastructure development, energy efficiency, waste management, and adopting climate-smart technologies.

CoM SSA is the regional chapter of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM), the largest global initiative of cities addressing climate and energy challenges. This bottom-up initiative encourages cities to voluntarily set and achieve ambitious yet realistic climate and energy targets."

1143649792,20231201,"In a strategic move to amplify awareness about the role played by the Sector Skills Bodies (SSBs) in Ghana, the Commission for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (CTVET) hosted a media engagement event at its premises.



The event, organized in collaboration with GIZ under the Pact for Skills: Support to the Transformation of the TVET System in Ghana, served as a crucial platform to spotlight the significance of SSBs in shaping a skilled and responsive workforce.



The engagement brought together journalists, industry representatives, and SSB leaders to foster a comprehensive understanding of the initiatives undertaken by SSBs and how they contribute to the nation's economic development.



""As we look to transform our TVET system, it's crucial to recognize the pivotal role played by Sector Skills Bodies in aligning our training programs with industry needs,"" emphasized [CTVET spokesperson]. ""Their involvement ensures that our graduates are not only equipped with theoretical knowledge but also possess the practical skills demanded by the workforce.""



Ms. Ramona Simon, representing the German Government, underscored the collaborative efforts to enhance skills development. ""Germany has long recognized the critical role that TVET plays in promoting economic growth,"" she remarked. ""Our investment reflects our commitment to transforming the potential of skills development. By partnering with Ghana, we aim to create a workforce that meets the evolving demands of the global economy.""



Deputy Minister for Education, Hon Gifty Twum Ampofo, stressed the importance of industry involvement in TVET. ""To ensure maximum success, we considered it crucial to forge mutually beneficial partnerships with the private sector,"" she explained. ""Our vision is to bridge the gap between education and industry needs. Through initiatives like Apprenticeship, Curriculum Development, and Skills Gap Analysis, we aim to create a symbiotic relationship that benefits both students and employers.""



""We are committed to making TVET education a global competitor,"" emphasized Hon Ampofo. ""The government, in collaboration with Germany, has invested $119,000 in completed projects, with an additional €16 million fund under the Austrian government for the upliftment and upgrading of technical institutions. This underscores our commitment to providing state-of-the-art facilities and resources to support skills development.""



Dr. Fred Kyei Asamoah, Director General of CTVET, spoke on sustaining TVET platforms. ""If we can have the sector skills bodies support the government, we can continuously sustain our TVET platforms,"" he remarked. ""The $22 million commitment from the government of Germany and $60 million from the World Bank towards an apprenticeship program is a testament to the global recognition of the importance of TVET in shaping a skilled workforce.""



Madam Constance Swaniker, Chairperson of the Sector Skills Committee, highlighted the importance of agile policies and regulations to keep pace with industry changes. ""All the conversation we are having is about creating jobs for young people,"" she emphasized. ""Our goal is to ensure that our curriculum is not only current but also anticipates industry changes. It shouldn't be a talk shop; we have to bring down the cost of doing business to facilitate a smooth transition for young people into the workforce.""



 



Madam Ethel Cofie, CEO and Founder of EDEL Technology Consulting, echoed the concerns of employers. ""People come out of school, and they are not very useful to us,"" she said. ""There are things we need to fix in that process. So what India has done in terms of hi-sense, I think if we follow that path, we will build a good human resource who can work in the industry or build their own companies. One of the things to look at is the license of professional standards; we should make sure that even if a plumber comes to your house, you can check their certification.""



The media engagement session concluded with a panel discussion and a presentation on TVET reforms by Dr. Fred Kyei Asamoah. The event was held at the CTVET Head office on Trinity Avenue in East Legon.



About Pact for Skills: Support to the Transformation of the TVET System in Ghana:



The Pact for Skills: Support to the Transformation of the TVET System is a joint action partnership between the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and European Union (EU) in cooperation with the Government of Ghana. The near 4-year long project is implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft fürInternationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH in cooperation with the Commission for TVET, Ghana TVET Service, AAMUSTED and other public and private sector partners.



In Ghana, the proportion of secondary school graduates who opt for vocational training could be better. Additionally, women make up only around a quarter of trainees and are severely underrepresented in technical and craft occupations. In 2019, the Government of Ghana initiated a transformation of the TVET sector better known as “Harmonization of TVET”.



In this context, all 218 TVET institutions which were previously spread over 19 different ministries were organized under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education (MoE).



Two agencies were newly established: The Commission for TVET (CTVET) responsible to regulate, promote and administer TVET and the TVET Service (TVETS) responsible to manage, oversee and implement approved national policies and programmes relating to pre-tertiary TVET. These two agencies are, among others, responsible for the expansion of competency-based training (CBT) approaches in Ghana.



Over the years, GIZ on behalf of the German Government supported reform processes through the Ghana Skills Development Initiative (GSDI). The Ghana Pact for Skills: Support to the Transformation of the TVET System in Ghana project is a continuation of the support to the Government of Ghana in this regard."

“Free trade and debt are not just about money,” said Attac Maroc. There is a logic of domination behind them. Debt has historically played a central role in the colonial system in Africa, while international trade has been hijacked by imperialist powers to advance their interests.

At the end of the 19th century, for example, France, Spain and Britain all had their eyes on Morocco and wanted to control it. In 1856, Britain pressured Morocco into signing a trade agreement that allowed the British to penetrate the Moroccan market, giving them a commercial advantage over their local counterparts.

The imposition of the French protectorate in 1912 was the final blow to Morocco’s sovereignty, which was unable to resist European encroachment. Soon after, the weakened country faced droughts and needed aid to deal with the situation. Morocco then became indebted to the colonial powers. The debt increased as a result of colonialism and the construction of infrastructure to serve colonial interests. By the time of independence in 1956, Morocco was one billion dirhams in debt.

In the 1980s, the implementation of neoliberal policies under the structural adjustment Structural Adjustment Economic policies imposed by the IMF in exchange of new loans or the rescheduling of old loans.

 

 Structural Adjustments policies were enforced in the early 1980 to qualify countries for new loans or for debt rescheduling by the IMF and the World Bank. The requested kind of adjustment aims at ensuring that the country can again service its external debt. Structural adjustment usually combines the following elements : devaluation of the national currency (in order to bring down the prices of exported goods and attract strong currencies), rise in interest rates (in order to attract international capital), reduction of public expenditure (’streamlining’ of public services staff, reduction of budgets devoted to education and the health sector, etc.), massive privatisations, reduction of public subsidies to some companies or products, freezing of salaries (to avoid inflation as a consequence of deflation). These SAPs have not only substantially contributed to higher and higher levels of indebtedness in the affected countries ; they have simultaneously led to higher prices (because of a high VAT rate and of the free market prices) and to a dramatic fall in the income of local populations (as a consequence of rising unemployment and of the dismantling of public services, among other factors).

 

 IMF : http://www.worldbank.org/ programmes of the World Bank World Bank

WB The World Bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at Bretton Woods in 1944. Its capital is provided by member states’ contributions and loans on the international money markets. It financed public and private projects in Third World and East European countries.

 

 It consists of several closely associated institutions, among which :

 

 1. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, 189 members in 2017), which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy ;

 

 2. The International Development Association (IDA, 159 members in 1997), which provides less advanced countries with long-term loans (35-40 years) at very low interest (1%) ;

 

 3. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries.

 

 As Third World Debt gets worse, the World Bank (along with the IMF) tends to adopt a macro-economic perspective. For instance, it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries’ payments. The World Bank advises those countries that have to undergo the IMF’s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits, round up savings, enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders, or free prices and exchange rates.

 

 and the IMF IMF

International Monetary Fund Along with the World Bank, the IMF was founded on the day the Bretton Woods Agreements were signed. Its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates.

 

 When the Bretton Wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971, the main function of the IMF became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital: it acts as policeman when it enforces its Structural Adjustment Policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments.

 

 As for the World Bank, a weighted voting system operates: depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state. 85% of the votes is required to modify the IMF Charter (which means that the USA with 17,68% % of the votes has a de facto veto on any change).

 

 The institution is dominated by five countries: the United States (16,74%), Japan (6,23%), Germany (5,81%), France (4,29%) and the UK (4,29%). 

 The other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country. The most important one (6,57% of the votes) is led by Belgium. The least important group of countries (1,55% of the votes) is led by Gabon and brings together African countries.

In addition, free trade agreements, such as those signed with the European Union and the United States, increased the country’s trade deficit, which in turn reduced the income of the Moroccan economy.

The case of Morocco shows how closely debt and free trade are intertwined. Debt in the global South has increased the push for free trade agreements, which in turn has reinforced Southern countries’ dependence on rich economies.

The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is a World Bank arbitration mechanism for resolving disputes that may arise between States and foreign investors. It was established in 1965 when the Washington Convention of that year entered into force. 

 

 Contrary to some opinions defending the fact that ICSID mechanism has been widely accepted in the American hemisphere, many States in the region continue to keep their distance: Canada, Cuba, Mexico and Dominican Republic are not party to the Convention. In the case of Mexico, this attitude is rated by specialists as “wise and rebellious”. We must also recall that the following Caribbean States remain outside the ICSID jurisdiction: Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica (Commonwealth of) and Suriname. In South America, Brazil has not ratified (or even signed) the ICSID convention and the 6th most powerful world economy seems to show no special interest in doing so. 

 

 In the case of Costa Rica, access to ICSID system is extremely interesting: Costa Rica signed the ICSID Convention in September, 1981 but didn’t ratify it until 12 years later, in 1993. We read in a memorandum of GCAB (Global Committee of Argentina Bondholders) that Costa Rica`s decision resulted from direct United States pressure due to the Santa Elena expropriation case, which was decided in 2000 : 

 ""In the 1990s, following the expropriation of property owned allegedly by an American investor, Costa Rica refused to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration. The American investor invoked the Helms Amendment and delayed a $ 175 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to Costa Rica. Costa Rica consented to the ICSID proceedings, and the American investor ultimately recovered U.S. $ 16 million”.

Before the triumph of neoliberalism, international trade was used by European countries as an instrument of geopolitical and commercial domination for the past 500 years, as bilaterals.org recalled. Colonial companies and states joined forces to conquer territories and impose legal regimes that benefited Europeans. For instance, Hugo Grotius, considered one of the fathers of international law, was a lawyer for the Dutch East India Company.

In this sense, colonialism was as much about the conquest of territory and the exploitation of wealth as it was about the imposition of trade rules based on European notions of wealth, the environment, and so on. For example, during the colonial era, Europeans created special tribunals to settle trade and investment disputes related to their activities in colonies.

Since decolonisation, the World Bank has played a central role in continuing this parallel judicial system. In 1965, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), part of the World Bank Group, was established on the basis of principles drawn up by Hermann Josef Abs ABS

Asset backed security A generic term designating a security issued by an intermediate entity (SPV) between a transferor and investors in the context of a securitization operation. This security is a bond. When the assets backing these securities (called underlying assets) are made up of mortgage loans like subprime loans, they are called Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). MBS are subdivided into Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS), backed by mortgage loans made to private individuals and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS). The term Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) is used when the underlying assets are bonds issued by companies or banks, and Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) when these assets are bank loans. , a German banker, and Hartley Shawcross, a British oil industry executive. ICSID provides an arbitral tribunal to resolve disputes relating to foreign investments. Bilateral investment treaties and free trade agreements include references to ICSID in the event of a dispute between a state and a foreign investor protected by such an agreement. This process is known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS).

The ISDS mechanism has been criticised by social movements around the world as it has caused terrible suffering in many countries of the global South. In South Africa, for example, European investors challenged a law aimed at redressing the inequalities of the apartheid era, and succeeded in getting the law watered down so that their profits would not be affected too much. Pakistan was also ordered to pay six billion dollars to an Australian company for cancelling a mining concession contract that the country’s Supreme Court had ruled illegal, even though the company had only invested about $200 million. There are over a thousand such claims around the world, wreaking havoc on populations, the environment and countries’ finances.

ISDS was at the heart of the negotiations between the European Union (EU) and Tunisia on a “Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement” (DCFTA), which has so far failed to win the approval of the Tunisian side.

According to the Tunisian Observatory of Economy, the DCFTA was meant to further the economic liberalisation already implemented by the 1995 Association Agreement between the two parties. A neocolonial attitude on the part of the Europeans could be felt during the negotiations, as the trade agreement was more about imposing European interests than having an agreement that could be truly beneficial to both sides.

European negotiators argued that the DCFTA would lead to a harmonisation of standards between the parties, but it was more about Tunisia agreeing to implement European regulations. For instance, the EU pushed Tunisia to accept European standards on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The EU also tried to lure Tunisia with financial aid, which the country needed to deal with the debt that had grown since the 2011 revolution, as a condition for signing the FTA.

A sense of coercion was felt throughout the negotiations, leading to a large movement of resistance in Tunisia. “Even deep in the countryside, everyone understood that the trade agreement was lopsised,” the Observatory insisted. For example, the EU could subsidise its agriculture, but Tunisia could not. A broad coalition managed to derail the agreement by organising protests, lobbying and public relations work, demanding parliamentary accountability and blocking negotiations. Ultimately, the DCFTA was shelved and negotiations have not resumed since.

The situation in Kenya is different, as Kenya signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU in June 2023. The EPA was originally supposed to be signed with the entire East African Community regional bloc, and negotiations were completed in 2014. But Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi refused to sign. Under pressure from the EU, Kenya finally agreed to the deal on its own. As the only non-least developed country in the East African bloc, Kenya stood to lose preferential access to the EU market. Kenya had also accumulated debt over the years, the Kenyan Peasants League pointed out, and the EPA package came with a development fund.

The EPA will strengthen export-oriented and monoculture Monoculture When one crop alone is cultivated. Many countries of the South have been induced to specialize in the production of a commodity for export (cotton, coffee, cocoa, groundnuts, tobacco, etc.) to procure hard currency for debt repayments. agriculture in Kenya, undermining the country’s food sovereignty and putting local producers in unhealthy competition with highly subsidised European companies. The League added that tomato farmers in Ghana were suffering from imports of cheap European produce. Chicken farmers in Cameroon have suffered the same fate. Both countries have EPAs with the EU.

There are also concerns from neighbouring countries that Kenya could act as a gateway to the East African common market and, more broadly, to Africa. When EPAs came into force in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, EU products found their way into the common market area of the Economic Community of West African States.

These are some of the reasons why EPAs have earned the sobriquet “economic pauperisation agreements”.

While social movements have been vocal in their opposition to the EPAs, another neoliberal project is looming over the African continent : the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

The idea of creating a Africa-wide free trade area emerged in 2012 as an initiative of the African Union (AU). The agreement was signed in 2018, but some of its trade rules have only been implemented since October 2022 and between just seven states. As of today, Eritrea is the only AU state that has refused to sign.

The AfCFTA aims to liberalise 90% of non-sensitive products and establish a common external tariff with the rest of the world, explained CADTM Africa.

Under the guise of pan-Africanism, the AfCFTA is built on the dogma of free market capitalism. It promotes an export-led development model. It includes trade rules found in bilateral agreements that benefit elites and transnational capital at the expense of local communities.

Someone in the audience from Mali remarked that free trade zones have been very problematic in her country. They have had a negative impact on communities and have encouraged land grabbing. In addition, there has never been any kind of public consultation or information sharing on the implementation of these zones.

Now, the AfCFTA promotes the expansion of operations in free trade zones to further promote so-called development, while it has been argued that regional integration in Africa should rather be built on the original pan-African principles of solidarity and complementarity to stop the bleeding.

The workshop concluded that social movements, communities, citizens, etc. need to build a power struggle to reverse the trend. In Côte d’Ivoire, local people protested against the arrival of the Auchan supermarket, which led to the closing of local shops, and boycotted the French company. A similar public campaign also targeted Auchan in Senegal. Such product boycotts can have an impact on large foreign companies.

Ultimately, this is a global issue, not just an African one. The plundering of resources is everyone’s problem. To defeat imperialism, Thomas Sankara said everyone should consume and eat local. Debt and so-called “free trade” have been instrumental in imposing a neocolonial system of domination based on ever more exports and dependence on extractivism. Favouring the local over the international could well be one of the alternatives for societies to face the challenges of our time, including the climate crisis, migration, food and energy sovereignty. International mobilisations such as this counter-summit allow people from all over the world to connect and raise awareness on global issues, thus playing an important role in building solidarity for social justice."

1143652241,20231201,"During the first day of the COP28 Climate Summit, millions of dollars in donations are putting pressure on wealthy countries, such as China, to make pledges to help address the issue.

The UN climate summit kicked off on Thursday with a slew of nations contributing to help poorer countries cope with the effects of global warming. This was seen as a surprise development.

The nation that led the charge is the oil-rich host of the summit, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which made a $100 million pledge. The contribution defused months of criticism about whether or not it could properly serve as an honest broker in talks about addressing fossil fuel dependence worldwide.

One made by Germany matched the UAE's pledge and kicked off a series of contributions from other nations. The development marked a remarkable opening day for the 28th annual COP conference. The European Union said it would be giving at least $245 million, including Germany's, for the fund, as per Politico.

On the other hand, the United Kingdom added $50 million, while the United States pledged $17.5 million. The UAE suddenly received praise over its massive donation as EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra expressed her gratitude to the nation for ""leading the way for new donors.""

Hoekstra added that because of the EU's efforts, the fund is open to contributions from all parties that can provide resources. The climate envoy's comment clearly indicated that the pledge transcended a decades-old divide in climate talks between ""developed"" and ""developing"" countries.

This is particularly true regarding financial matters, and many activists and climate-vulnerable countries have long argued that wealthy, industrialized nations are responsible for most of the planet's warming emissions. They also demanded for these countries to take responsibility and take the lead on funding climate action.

Despite the relatively good news on the first day of the climate summit, the US is criticized for its ""embarrassing"" amount of money contributed. For years, the demand for a fund to channel money to developing countries stymied progress at yearly negotiations, according to CNN.

Earlier this month, the details of the fund were agreed upon at a pre-COP meeting and formalized on Thursday. The development was made in the hopes that it would allow for progress in other areas at the summit.

In a statement, COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber said that they have delivered history following the massive contribution of the UAE. He noted that it was the first time a decision had been adopted on the first day of any COP conference.

While the pledges mark a historic moment for the climate summit, world leaders still cannot agree on stopping the burning of fossil fuels even after 27 years of conferences. Scientists say this particular resource is the main driver of climate change worldwide.

Additionally, the COP28 event is being hosted in the UAE, a country that is increasing its oil production. It has also been accused of using its position as the summit host to strike oil and gas deals with other nations, said the New York Times.

1143657166,20231201,"Ghana is among 198 nations and the European Union Block, who have feverishly prepared to start another round of climate related negotiations at the 28th Conference of Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), from Thursday, November 30th to Tuesday, December 12th, in Dubai, UAE.

High on the nation’s priority for presentation and negotiation at COP28, is the importance of scaling up forest and nature-based solutions to climate change. This is underscored by the fact that half of the country’s national greenhouse gas emissions have been attributed to agricultural, forest and land use (AFOLU) activities.

Therefore, COP28 will be an opportunity for Ghana to demonstrate the effectiveness of her efforts at reducing emissions from the AFOLU sector.

These were some of the key issues highlighted at a pre-COP28 event organised by the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources (MLNR) in Accra on Monday November 30th, 2023.

Ghana’s Second Lady, Samira Bawumia, who was the special guest of honour noted that “climate change is an existential crisis that disproportionately affects us all.” She was particularly concerned that “the situation in Sub-Saharan Africa was more precarious because the Region is expected to experience a significant decline in agricultural input and this will pose a great threat in food security and livelihoods.”

Her Excellency Bawumia was also concerned that while women and children were highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, they also had the least access to resources, opportunities and decision-making power to cope with these challenges. “It is therefore imperative,” she stated, “that they are included in the design, implementation and development of climate change strategies.”

She urged them to commit themselves to work together to ensure that “the voices of women and children are not just heard, but are at the forefront of the fight against climate change.” Her Excellency Bawumia admitted that the journey will be challenging, but stressed that it must be undertaken, “for the sake of our shared future.” She added: “together we can open a new chapter in the story of our planet and our continent. A chapter, where humanity stands together as guardians of nature, safeguarding the earth for generations to come.” Her expectation was that “our collective voices at COP28, spur on the support, change and commitment we need so that our result will be a cleaner, greener and more sustainable continent that we all want.”

Earlier, in his brief to participants on the sector’s priority for presentation at COP28, the sector minister, Samuel Abu Jinapor said the pre-COP28 session was meant to solidify partners and stakeholders support to accelerate action on forest and nature-based solutions to climate change.

In a related development, the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI) organised a similar pre-COP28 event on Thursday 31st August 2023 to purposely inaugurate a multi-sectoral committee to plan and coordinate activities across sectors for successful participation in COP28. The sector minister, Dr. Kwaku Afriyie, inaugurated the 18-member committee, chaired by MESTI’s Director of Environment, Dr Peter Dery.

Meanwhile, members of Ghana’s civil society had also been actively preparing themselves for active participation in C0P 28 through various activities.

They include Friday, November 10th, 2023, workshop on Methane Action organised by Greener Impact International in collaboration with Kasa Initiative Ghana, the Hatof Foundation and the Ghana’s CSO platform on SDGs. The event served as a first step towards strengthening the cross collaborations between CSOs, local communities and policy actors to tackle methane emission in Ghana.

Then, last Monday, November 27th, 2023, Abantu for Development, PACJA and the @keepyourpromisecampaign on a Pre-COP28 Presser in collaboration with the Kasa Initiative Ghana, a Natural Resource and Environment (NRE) Civil Society Platform held a press conference in Accra. The purpose was to create public awareness on COP28 and demand that world leaders deliver on their promises to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change.

Also, on Wednesday, 22nd November, 2023 Kasa Initiative Ghana in collaboration with the Climate Change Unit of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) organised a COP 28 capacity building workshops for its members. As a result, the knowledge of CSO members on matters such as Carbon Trade, what it entails, who can engage in it and the process involved.

On the same day, the Youth Climate Council, Ghana also organised an event in Accra on Wednesday 22nd November, 2023 on “Capacity Building for Climate Justice: Storytelling as a Tool for climate Justice and Good Security,” for youth from different parts of the country in Accra.

It is worthy of note that the Strategic Youth Network for Development (SYND) utilized a greater portion of the month of November to roll-out several youth focused in-person and on-line events on different aspects of the UNFCCC and related protocols. The aim was to empower stakeholders especially the youth to contribute meaningfully to COP28 discussions and negotiations.

Therefore, Gifty Elikplim Agbenyefia of SYND is much more confident of a productive participation in COP28, which she sees as making space for young voices to call leaders to action. But most importantly, Gifty believes “COP28 is presenting an opportune period for the young voices to demand leaders to implement actions that will yield positive results especially when it comes to committing funds for actions under loss and damage.”

The term “Loss and damage” is used in UN climate negotiations to refer to the consequences of climate change that go beyond what people can adapt to. It additionally, refers to situations when options exist but a community does not have the resources to access or utilize these options. The crucial point of on-going discussion on loss and damages, is on why and how richer countries should compensate poorer countries for the effects of climate-related extreme weather effects.

Central to COP 28 is how far the world has come since the forging of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 with three main goals: keep global temperature rise to “well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels;” adapt to climate change and build resilience; and align finance flow with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

So, aside working towards the 1.5 degree Celsius goal and doubling up plans to reduce emissions which is key to preventing dangerous global warming, COP28 will discuss a number of issues – how to make countries move to clean energy sources more quickly; ensure richer countries provide more money to poorer countries to help them undertake more climate actions; and to work on a new climate agreement for developing nations.

Africa’s COP28 preparations were also energetic. The various in-country COP28 related dialogues and meetings culminated in the inaugural Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi, Kenya in September 2023, under the auspices of the African Union.

The summit concluded with the Nairobi Declaration, which presented an African position in the global climate change process that pushes for green growth and a transformed climate finance environment and which leaves no one behind. It calls for the global community to act with urgency to reduce emissions, honour past commitments and support Africa’s climate action.

Ultimately, this declaration will form the basis of the continent’s negotiations and guide the articulation of the African position at COP28. It is a verbatim declaration support by leadership for: “A SUCCESSFUL AND AMBITIOUS COP28 THAT GOES BEYOND MERE TALK.”"
1143663926,20231201,"Countries promise millions for damages from climate change. So how would that work?

As climate change negotiations kicked off in Dubai, countries reached a historic agreement for a new fund to help developing countries which bear the brunt of climate impacts.

More than $400 million was announced, with the largest pledges coming from Germany and the United Arab Emirates, to kick off the ""loss and damage"" fund. They are the first pledges since the fund was created at climate negotiations last year.

The idea is to aid developing countries that are already dealing with devastating impacts, like hurricanes, droughts and floods. But the initial funding is a tiny fraction of the overall need. A recent United Nations report found it will cost developing countries $215 to $387 billion per year to adapt to climate change.

Before the fund can make a difference on the ground, countries still have a number of issues to sort out, including which countries will pay into it and which countries will receive funding.

""Pledges should be commensurate with the scale of the needs for loss and damage, which is already costing hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars a year,"" said Angela Rivera, speaking for Colombia at the COP28 summit. ""We need to scale up quickly to make up for 30 years of lost time.""

What is loss and damage?

Here's the need that one country is facing: the small island nation of Antigua and Barbuda.

Like many Caribbean islands, it's extremely vulnerable to hurricanes that are becoming more destructive as the climate warms. In 2017, a massive category 5 storm, Hurricane Irma, hit the islands. The storm's size was larger than the islands themselves and left widespread destruction in its wake.

""You just have to replace every single thing,"" says Diann Black-Layne, climate change ambassador for Antigua and Barbuda. ""The homes are damaged, and there's no place to go. And the whole island gets hit - the entire population is affected.""

The cost of rebuilding has been challenging, she says. And rebuilding does not take into account preparing the country for the next storm. The island's homes and buildings are mainly built to withstand category 2 hurricanes. Upgrading them to withstand stronger storms, by adding features like wind-resistant roofs, just adds to the cost.

On top of that, rising sea levels are threatening coastal development, which means residents will need to be relocated. That also threatens their fresh water supply, as saltwater creeps inland. Dealing with and preparing for the impacts of climate change will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Black-Layne says.

""We are looking at 2 or 300 percent of our national GDP just to get ready,"" she says. ""Our way of life and our ability to live here, our ability to even have an economy is threatened.""

How will a loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries work?

For years, developing countries have sought compensation for the damages caused by climate change. Cumulatively, the U.S. and Europe are responsible for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions going back to the Industrial Revolution. Developing countries are bearing the brunt of the impacts, having contributed little to climate change.

""This climate problem was caused by the industrialization of rich countries,"" says Avinash Persaud, special climate envoy for Barbados. ""It is, in fact, how they got rich. And so they do need to show recognition and some responsibility in helping to finance the reconstruction and rehabilitation costs of climate impacts.""

A dedicated fund for loss and damage would be used to help countries prepare communities for the climate impacts that are already happening, as well as deal with the inevitable losses, like flooded burial grounds and other culturally important sites.

After a series of tense meetings over the last year, countries agreed to base the fund at the World Bank temporarily for four years. Some developing countries raised concerns that would burden them with high fees and too much influence from richer nations. As a result, developing countries will have equal representation on the board that controls the fund.

Who will pay for a loss and damage fund?

The initial contributions will mainly get the fund up and running. Germany and the United Arab Emirates both announced $100 million. The United Kingdom announced 60 million pounds and Japan announced $10 million. The European Union says it will pledge 225 million euros overall.

The United States announced $17.5 million as well. The Biden Administration generally faces opposition from Republicans in Congress over international climate spending.

Going forward, hundreds of billions of dollars will be needed annually. There's still debate over which countries will contribute as well. China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses currently, has not committed any funding, though some developed countries are pushing for it to contribute to the fund.

""We expect it will draw from a wide variety of sources,"" Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry said at the COP28 talks. ""The scale of the challenge is simply too large for any government to be able to finance alone.""

Richer countries are already behind on previous promises to provide financing for climate change. So some developing countries are proposing other ways of raising money for the loss and damage fund like a tax on oil sales or on methane, a potent greenhouse gas produced by agriculture and oil and gas companies. Those questions will be raised as the loss and damage fund is officially set up over the next year."
1143663927,20231201,"Profits jumped at Orla Kiely last year, as a revamp of its ecommerce business boosted sales at the brand worn by the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker and the UK’s Princess of Wales.

The clothing firm reported a profit after tax £870,000 (€1.01 million) for 2023, an increase of 61 per cent compared with a year ago, the company said in a statement referring to accounts filed for parent company Olive & Orange Ltd. Turnover surged 42 per cent to just over £5 million.

“The Orla Kiely brand has delivered another year of strong trading,” Dermott Rowan, managing director and co-owner of the business, said. “Our highly successful ecommerce operation has supported a significant jump in product income, as Orla Kiely products are enjoyed by more people in more countries.”

Much of the sales growth was driven by product revenue, which in turn is driven mainly by the ecommerce business. It jumped from £2.1 million to £3.3 million during the year, the company said.

“The launch of a new website has driven significant ecommerce growth in both UK and international markets. This was supported by the opening of a new hub in the Netherlands, supporting online customers across the European Union. The extended homewares range, a new initiative launched during the year, has also supported ecommerce growth,” it added.

Royalties income, which comes from manufacturers licensed to make and distribute Orla Kiely designed products wholesale increased to £1.6 million from £1.3 million. The business currently has relationships with eight active licensees, with new licences signed this year in the womenswear, children and baby lines.

The retail arm of the so-called historic Orla Kiely business went into administration in 2018. The brand relaunched a year later.

Public figures and celebrities seen wearing Orla Kiely designs have included the UK’s Princess of Wales, as well as Keira Knightley, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kirsten Dunst and Lena Dunham.

“I am deeply proud of the Orla Kiely team for building the brand into the powerhouse of mid-century design that it is today, with a growing and dedicated international customer base,” Mr Rowan said."

Funding will be in the form of a project-level grant commitment of up to â¬35,000,000 from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and â¬25,000,000 Venture Debt financing commitment from the European Investment Bank, both subject to the satisfaction of funding conditions. The funds are being made available through the EUâBreakthrough Energy Catalyst partnership.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231201183451/en/

Breakthrough Energy Catalyst funds and invests in first-of-a-kind commercial projects for emerging climate technologies. By investing in these opportunities, Catalyst seeks to accelerate the adoption of these technologies worldwide and reduce their costs.

The European Investment Bank, also recognizing the transformative potential of Energy Dome's CO2 Battery to combat climate change and be a clean technology champion in Europe, is expected to provide â¬25,000,000 of Venture Debt financing, backed by InvestEU, to the project. The EU aligns capital with Catalyst using funds available from Horizon Europe & Innovation Fund through the InvestEU Program with the European Investment Bank, as implementing partner of the European Commission.

This combined investment is an endorsement of Energy Domeâs ready-to-be-deployed, long-duration energy storage proposition. Energy Domeâs robust performance (high round-trip efficiency) and capital expenditure requirements are significantly more competitive than the Lithium-Ion benchmark, providing a solution to the critical problem of utility-scale long-duration energy storage, which is at the core of the renewable energy transition.

The project will use a standard frame 20MW/200MWh CO2 Battery, which can supply energy to the grid for ten consecutive hours. It will be the first of a series of identical units using the same technology design, allowing Energy Dome to unlock cost reductions and accelerate the bankability of future units of the modular, standardized CO2 Battery frames. The CO2 Battery does not use materials from rare metals and its main components are based on already existing and known supply chains enabling job creation within Europe.

The Commercial Operation Date of the storage facility is expected to take place in the third quarter of 2024.

Claudio Spadacini, Founder and CEO of Energy Dome, said: ""What better time than during COP28 to announce the collaboration with the EU-Breakthrough Energy Catalyst partnership, which is a true catalyst for our company. The collaboration will accelerate the commercialization of our market-ready technology and will be the first of many identical full-scale CO2 Batteries. We have already started to be at the core of the energy transition. Remember, our world canât wait.â

Gelsomina Vigliotti, EIB Vice-President, said: âAs the EU climate bank, the EIB is committed to building public and private partnerships to support the development of disruptive green energy technologies and to enable these to grow to scale in the short-term. I am delighted to announce the EIBâs intention to support Energy Dome with a EUR 25 million Venture Debt financing. It is an inspiring example of game-changing technology that we need more of in Europe and worldwide. At the same time, the project will promote job creation and economic growth in Sardinia.â

Mario Fernandez, Head of Catalyst at Breakthrough Energy, said: âLong-duration energy storage is a critical enabler of the clean energy transition and this partnership with Energy Dome, the European Commission and European Investment Bank will help scale the technology so it can be commercialized sooner. This announcement demonstrates the tangible impact of Breakthrough Energy Catalystâs approach to fund impactful projects that can move us closer to an emissions-free future.â

About the European Investment Bank 

The EIB is the lending institution of the EU, owned by its Member States and makes long-term finance available for sound investment to advance the EUâs policy goals. Between 2019 and 2022, the EIB Group provided more than â¬45 billion in financing for projects in Italy.

In 2019, the EIBâs Energy Lending Policy was adopted to end financing to any unabated fossil fuels energy projects, including natural gas, the first Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) to do so. In 2021, the EIB became the first MDB to align our financial activities with the Paris Agreement. Through its Climate Bank Roadmap, the EIB Group aims to support â¬1 trillion of investment in climate action and environmental sustainability through the critical decade, 2021-2030. The EIB committed to increasing investment in climate action and environmental sustainability to more than 50 % of the EIBâs annual lending by 2025 â last year, that was exceeded with 58%.

About the European Commission 

The European Commission is part of the executive of the European Union. The Commission has a range of policies and programmes to deliver on its climate ambitions. Under the European Green Deal, the âFit for 55' package was adopted in July 2021 with the aim of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. The EU-Catalyst partnership is one of the key actions through, which the European Commission seeks achieve this goal through mobilizing private funding through public support.

Horizon Europe is the EU's research and innovation framework programme worth â¬95.5 billion (2021-2027). It dedicates 35% of its budget to climate action. At the same time, the programme also supports a range of partnerships which mobilise private funding to deliver on pressing global challenges and modernise industry through research and innovation. The programme also includes the European Innovation Council (EIC) that supports start-ups and companies in the whole innovation chain, from research to validation, acceleration and commercialization.

The Innovation Fund is one of the worldâs largest funding programmes for the demonstration of low- and zero-carbon innovative solutions and technologies funded entirely from EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) revenues and estimated at â¬40 billion until 2030. The Fund has so far provided almost â¬7 billion in grants for over 100 projects through calls for proposals. On 23 November 2023, the Innovation Fund opened its 7th call for proposals and its first auction.

The InvestEU programme provides the European Union with crucial long-term funding by leveraging substantial private and public funds in support of a sustainable recovery. It also helps mobilise private investments for the European Unionâs policy priorities, such as the European Green Deal and the digital transition. The InvestEU programme brings together under one roof the multitude of EU financial instruments currently available to support investment in the European Union, making funding for investment projects in Europe simpler, more efficient and more flexible. The programme consists of three components: the InvestEU Fund, the InvestEU Advisory Hub and the InvestEU Portal. The InvestEU Fund is implemented through financial partners that will invest in projects using the EU budget guarantee of â¬26.2 billion. The entire budget guarantee will back the investment projects of the implementing partners, increase their risk-bearing capacity and thus mobilise at least â¬372 billion in additional investment."

Threads has been available in most markets worldwide since its launch in July and proved immediately successful. But Meta held off launching in the EU due to the union’s stringent regulations on social media and other online services. According to The Wall Street Journal’s sources, the planned launch in the EU shows that Meta is committed to the micro-blogging platform.

To comply with the EU’s regulations, EU users will be allowed to choose between using Threads for consumption only without a profile or creating a profile to post, the sources said. All Threads users will also soon be able to delete their Threads accounts without having to also delete the linked Instagram account.

The planned launch comes at a good time for many Dutch businesses, who have been pulling advertisements from X over Musk’s association with racist and anti-Semitic posts, as well as X scaling back on its moderation of hate speech. Bol.com, the State Lottery, and VodafoneZiggo are among the businesses no longer advertising on X.

Many Dutch businesses, including KLM, are also no longer offering client services on X. This has created fertile ground for fraudsters, who pose as companies to try and scam personal details out of unsuspecting X users."

1143696762,20231201,"Out along Europe’s western fringe, Ireland occupies a unique geographical and cultural space, where the continent ends and the vast ocean begins. Separated from Britain by as little as 12 miles (19 km), Ireland’s island history has been inextricably linked to that of its larger fellow island nation throughout the past, despite their deep current political differences. Curiously, due to the capricious winds of history, today it is the more geographically remote Republic of Ireland that shelters in the fold of the European Union, rather than Britain, with its robust record of involvement in the continent’s affairs. Buffered by the seas, Ireland has traditionally been overshadowed by Britain’s geopolitical machinations. In antiquity, when Britain was part of the Roman Empire, Ireland remained a barbarian land of myths, touched by Roman culture and trade but never by Roman politics or armies.

Because of its history, Ireland has become a sui generis creation on Europe’s edge, the farthest bank lapped by a broad stream of Northern European cultures that have flourished since the end of the last Ice Age, its people shaped by its isolation. The Emerald Isle is part of a larger story but comes bearing its own unique plot twists. It is also an island of unique genetic characteristics, most salient among them the highest frequency of red hair in the world, which is probably a legacy of migrations more than 4,000 years in the past.

The last light of the sun

Ireland remained neutral during World War II, and to this day, it stands committed to geopolitical neutrality. But even 2,000 years ago, its remoteness left it uniquely beyond Rome’s reach and geopolitical influence. Christianity did not spread to Ireland through pressure from the Roman Empire, nor did it arrive by winning over a powerful king, as occurred in most of Northern Europe. Rather, Irish Christianity developed organically through contact with Roman Britain (St. Patrick was in fact British), recruiting warlords of the island one by one over several centuries from 400 A.D. onward. Ironically, when Rome fell and Britain was conquered by pagan Saxons, Ireland instead remained a redoubt of Christianity, eventually sending missionaries to mainland Europe in the 500s and 600s who would found monasteries in the borderlands between Italy, France, and Switzerland. These Irish monks were also instrumental in converting the pagan Saxon kings of England to Christianity.

But Ireland’s remove from the currents of Northwest European history is not an eternal constant. The permanent human occupation of Ireland after the last Ice Age 12,000 years ago began as part of the broader resettlement of Europe’s deglaciated north that defined the early prehistory of Britain, Germany, and Scandinavia. The earliest Mesolithic hunter-gatherers relied on fishing and foraging along the maritime fringes after they arrived in Ireland, where the earliest archaeological sites cluster near the ocean. These earliest Irish foragers were genetically identical to their contemporaries in mainland Europe and Britain, and they all descended from small groups of humans who rode out the end of the Ice Age in favorable pockets of Southern Europe. When archaeologists began collaborating with geneticists ten years ago, submitting prehistoric remains to DNA-sequencing technology, they discovered that very little of modern Irish or Northern European heritage more generally derives from these first settlers, the “ Western Hunter-Gatherers.” One surprising aspect of these earliest inhabitants of Northern Europe was that they were strikingly physically different from today’s people in the region, with blue eyes but very dark skin.

Six thousand years ago, populous farming societies replaced the few thousand Irish Mesolithic foragers on the island. These people would usher in the Neolithic and eventually build vast passage tombs like Newgrange. A generation ago, there was a live debate as to whether these farmers were actually newcomers from the continent or foragers who adopted the practices of people to their south and east. Today, ancient DNA makes clear that on the whole, these were newcomers from the continent, part of a two-pronged push of agriculturalists from Anatolia that began nearly 10,000 years ago, spreading west across the Mediterranean to become the Iberian Cardial Culture and deep into the heart of Europe, via riverine valleys, to become the German Linear Pottery Culture. These two distinct streams of early agriculturalists eventually merged together in the northwest of the continent. But the Irish Neolithic people seem to have come more from the Iberian Cardial Culture, as the island’s farming societies show more genetic affinity with Iberian Neolithic people who drifted up along the Atlantic fringe than with farmers crossing over from northern Germany via Britain.

While the culture and history of Ireland over the last few thousand years have been marked by their distinctness from other societies, genetics and archaeology both indicate that during the Irish Neolithic, between 4000 and 2500 BC, the island was deeply integrated into the information and trade networks of continental Europe. Vast megalithic constructions, which reached their apogee in massive passage tombs, spread outward from Brittany 6,000 years ago, until they dotted the Atlantic coast of Europe from Denmark to Iberia, even reaching Malta in the Mediterranean. Genetically, we know the megalith builders were all the same people, Neolithic farmers most genetically similar to modern Sardinians. It is likely that they shared cultural affinities and adopted a new ideology during this period that involved the construction of monumental architecture.

Red hair as a trait in our species is not shocking, as many mammals and birds exhibit red pigmentation. The pigment that causes red hair, pheomelanin, is found in copious quantities in most humans. In most cases, we see it overwhelmed by the presence of eumelanin, the dark pigment that results in the majority of humans having black hair. Ultimately, the color of individual human hair is simply a function of the balance of these two pigments.

In Ireland, there are actually individuals buried in the great earth and stone tombs, and many have now been genetically analyzed by archaeologists and geneticists. Some of the results have been surprising. About 5,000 years ago, a high-status male was buried at Newgrange, and his genes suggest that his parents were probably siblings. Anthropologists note that this level of inbreeding is a hallmark of elites in societies that are extremely hierarchical, such as ancient Egypt or pre-contact Hawaii. The archaeologists also noticed that most of the elite males they found in other passage tombs across the island share the same Y chromosome, suggesting that the ruling class was defined by a particular paternal lineage, prefiguring the later Uí Néill (O’Neill) domination of Ireland. Finally, these elite individuals tended to look like most of the other people of Neolithic Europe, with dark eyes and hair and lighter skin, though a few had very dark skin indicative of some holdover ancestry from the earlier forager populations.

But affinities between the ancient and modern Irish only began to be established 4,500 years ago, with the arrival of a group from continental Europe to Britain and Ireland whom we term the “Bell Beakers” for their pottery style. As in Britain, the arrival of Bell Beaker people to Ireland was momentous, as over a few centuries the genetic profile of the island shifted from domination by people who resemble modern Sardinians to those broadly ancestral to the modern Irish. The arrival of these people brought a new paternal lineage: 90% of Irish and British Bell Beaker men seem to have carried Y-chromosomal haplogroup R1b-L21.

Today, two-thirds of Irish men bear this lineage, in contrast with 50% in Scotland and Wales and 20% in England. The divergence of Ireland from other regions of Northern Europe today appears to date from the Bronze Age 3,000 years ago, as subsequent waves of migrants and conquerors from the continent seem to have impacted Britain far more than Ireland (swamping out the British proportion of R1b-L21).

And it was with the arrival of the Bell Beaker people 4,500 years ago that the standard physical characteristics of modern Irish people also began to coalesce. It is then that samples from Beaker burial grounds first begin to indicate the presence of individuals with blue eyes, very light skin, and lighter hair. And notably among modern Western Europeans, it is populations from the Celtic fringe, Ireland and Scotland, that have the highest frequencies of red hair.

Pigmentation is one of any organism’s most obvious characteristics, and red hair is notable for its salience and rarity in humans. Celtic populations have very high fractions of red-haired individuals, around 10%, and this small minority often stands in for the whole group. The film ""Brave,"" which centers around a young Scottish woman, predictably depicted the protagonist with a wild mane of red hair.

Red hair as a trait in our species is not shocking, as many mammals and birds exhibit red pigmentation. The pigment that causes red hair, pheomelanin, is found in copious quantities in most humans. In most cases, we see it overwhelmed by the presence of eumelanin, the dark pigment that results in the majority of humans having black hair. Ultimately, the color of individual human hair is simply a function of the balance of these two pigments. Most humans have both pheomelanin and eumelanin in abundance, so their hair is one dark shade or another. The coppery undertones evident in some individuals are simply due to the presence of pheomelanin that in others is more thoroughly dominated by the darker pigment. Those with very little of either variety of melanin may have blond hair. Finally, those individuals with very little eumelanin and copious pheomelanin will have red hair.

The combination of characteristics needed here, a great deal of the red pigment that is normally masked by the dark pigment alongside very little of the latter, illustrates why red hair is not common and often mistakenly perceived as “recessive.” The genetic variants associated with red hair have been localized to the melanocortin 1 receptor or MC1R. A critical regulatory gene in mammals relating to pigmentation, MC1R was the subject of much early work on pigmentation and coat colors in model organisms like mice. Twenty years ago, to explore pigmentation meant to examine MC1R, so its connection to red hair has long been established. In contrast, more recent pigmentation genetic variants discovered since the year 2000 have tended to account for variation in eye and skin color.

In fact, variation in this gene causing red hair probably predates modern humans. Some Neanderthals, who separated from our own lineage more than 600,000 years ago, likely had red hair. Obviously, we lack photographic evidence, but in 2007 geneticists managed to retrieve DNA from Neanderthal remains, and the region around MC1R exhibited all the hallmarks of numerous mutations that broke the function of the gene, resulting in loss of pigmentation. But this was more than just an educated guess. The team actually inserted an MC1R sequence with Neanderthal mutations into a bacterium to see if the gene would express the protein associated with a normally functioning gene, and it did not.

This prompted many to wonder if modern Europeans inherited red hair from Neanderthals. The genomic evidence says no, as modern Europeans have a new cluster of mutations that cause the red hair phenotype, distinct from those seen in their Neanderthal ancestors. In fact, though in mainland Europe red hair is most common in the far northwest, in Ireland and Scotland (the correlation between the R1b-L21 Y chromosome and the frequency of red hair is actually quite high), it is also common on the far northeastern edge of Europe, among tribal Uralic people like the Udmurts.

As the same genes are implicated in pigmentation variation right across species (the gene most responsible for lighter skin in Europeans, SLC24A5, was first discovered in small fish), it is no surprise that MC1R can mutate to produce red hair in separate human lineages in different ways. Not only does MC1R have a major role in pigmentation (as the name would indicate, melanocortin being implicated in the production of melanin), but it is also involved in our inflammatory response and development of cartilage, as well as correlated with different cancer risks.

Perhaps the most curious aspect of red hair in humans is its strong association with the need for greater anesthesia levels due to higher pain sensitivity. Unsurprisingly, both humans and mice with MC1R mutations need higher levels of painkillers to experience the same effect as those with more common genotypes.

Today, thanks to ancient DNA and archaeology, we know that the people who brought red hair to Ireland and the related Celtic nations of Wales and Scotland were likely the Bell Beakers, carriers of the Y-chromosomal haplogroup R1b-L21. This association is even present in southwestern Norway, where the fraction of red hair and R1b-L21 is higher than in the rest of Scandinavia (this was an area where during the Dark Ages, Vikings brought Irish slaves back with them). Looking at patterns in the ancient DNA, it is now likely that the genetic and cultural differences between Ireland and England only began to accumulate 3,000 years ago, as Ireland remained insulated from migrations and movements that repeatedly overwhelmed its eastern neighbor. The unique character of the modern Irish, then, goes back to the Beaker people 4,500 years ago, as the dark-skinned Mesolithic foragers and the dark-haired builders of Newgrange left little genetic legacy in the modern people.

But mysteries remain to be unpacked. We know that the modern Irish have among the highest frequencies of red hair, but we do not understand the evolutionary adaptation that drove this trait to become somewhat common among the Bell Beakers’ descendants. It is perhaps too coincidental that Neanderthals, Celts, and the Udmurt all occupy very high latitudes in Eurasia, suggesting some possible compensation for limited sunlight. But then again, Scandinavia is dark for much of the year, and red hair there is rather uncommon. The reality that MC1R regulates many characteristics, from pain to cancer risk, points to the possibility that there is an unknown benefit to red hair in certain populations to which we remain oblivious.

Perhaps, then, Ireland’s genetic and cultural isolation for the last 3,000 years can be seen in this light, as a separate and distinct laboratory of evolution from other regions of Northern Europe. This is not to say that Ireland was entirely isolated, as Britons brought Roman Christianity and Vikings founded settlements like Dublin and Cork around the fringe of the island more than 1,000 years ago. But its unique geographic position, facing onto the unbounded Atlantic ocean to its west and insulated even from Britain to the east, has allowed Ireland to slowly careen off on its own idiosyncratic path, buffered from the turbid tides of much of European history since the time of the Greeks and Romans.

MINSK. Dec 1 (Interfax) - Over 2,300 trucks were waiting to cross into the European Union from Belarus on Friday morning, the Belarusian State Border Committee said in a statement.

""The number of trucks headed to the EU reached 2,300 by the weekend. As of 10 a.m., the busiest route to the EU goes through the Polish Kukuryki checkpoint [Kozlovichi on the side of Belarus], where more than 730 trucks are waiting to cross into the adjacent territory. The controlling services admitted less than half of the normal number of vehicles, 45%, over the day,"" the statement said.

About 1,500 trucks are waiting to cross the Belarusian-Lithuanian border. ""The smallest number of vehicles has been cleared at the Medininkai checkpoint [Kamenny Log on the side of Belarus] - 7% of the normal number, or one truck out of 20 possible within an hour. The most congested checkpoint in this area is Shalcininkai (Benyakoni),"" it said.

Forty-three percent of the normal number of trucks have crossed into the EU through the Latvian checkpoint Paternieki (Belarus' Grigorovshchina) over the day, the committee said.

It said on Thursday that the total number of trucks stranded at the Belarus-EU border had topped 2,000, compared to approximately 1,400 the day before."

1143714425,20231201,"At a press conference of the summit of OSCE foreign ministers, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made another round of cynical statements about Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He began to claim that Russia is allegedly at war with the West, while Ukraine refuses to negotiate with the aggressor.

The head of Russia's ""diplomacy"", in his usual boorish manner, said that instead of negotiating a ""tango"", Kyiv and the West ""break-dance"" and that Moscow ""sees no reason to revise the goals of the special operation"". Lavrov's statements, made in Skopje, North Macedonia, are being replicated by Russian journalists.

According to Lavrov, the aggressor state is willing to negotiate, but the unwillingness of Kyiv and Ukraine's Western partners to stop Russian aggression against Ukraine allegedly stands in the way.

""It takes two to start a political process. It's like a tango. But the guys on the other side are not dancing tango, but breakdancing. You have to solo there,"" the Russian Foreign Minister said.

He recalled a recent statement by the head of the Servant of the People party faction in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, David Arakhamia, who said that in March 2022, during the Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul, ""peace agreements"" were allegedly almost reached. At the same time, Lavrov expectedly blamed the then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the failure to conclude these agreements. The fact that the world then saw the atrocities committed by the Russian military in the Kyiv region, according to Lavrov, had nothing to do with Ukraine's unwillingness to negotiate with war criminals.

Lavrov also complained that no one wants to capitulate to Russia, which is destroying Ukrainian cities, killing Ukrainians, occupying part of Ukraine and committing many war crimes against our country.

""So far, we have not seen any signals from either Kyiv or its hosts that they are ready to move to the political process. We don't see any. Moreover, a year and a half ago, Zelenskyi signed a special decree prohibiting negotiations with Putin's government, so this is a court case. He is not going to cancel it,"" Lavrov said.

He repeated the Kremlin's traditional mantra that Russia is allegedly at war not with Ukraine, but with the entire West. And that Western countries are ""unreasonably"" afraid that the aggressor's appetite will only increase if Ukraine is captured.

""And if you listen to what they are saying and what all the secretaries general of NATO and the European Union are saying, they are saying only one thing: that we must support Ukraine, because if Ukraine fails, it will be a defeat for the whole West. And lately, they have started to add that after Ukraine, Russia, Putin, will go to the Baltic States, Poland, and other neighboring countries. This was not said by some fringe politician. This was said by the head of the Pentagon, Mr. Austin. He said that Russia will not stop at Ukraine, so we have no right to lose in Ukraine. Whether they lose or win, they don't hide it. They are waging a war,"" the Russian Foreign Minister skillfully blamed the sick head on the healthy one.

Lavrov also spoke about the ""goals of the SMO"". They have apparently changed again. This time, according to the Russian Foreign Minister, the aggressor state intends to ""force"" Ukraine to comply with its own constitution. According to the Kremlin's interpretation, it obliges Ukraine, for example, to abandon teaching in public schools in Ukrainian in favor of Russian. Lavrov's speech was also not without the old tales of ""oppression of ethnic Russians"" in Ukraine.

Lavrov assures us that Moscow does not intend to ""revise"" these constantly changing ""goals.""

""I proceed from the fact that the leadership of our special military operation knows what goals it is achieving. This operation is controlled on a regular basis by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, and we see no reason why our goals should be revised. At least for the sake of returning these people to the implementation of their own constitution,"" the head of Russian ""diplomacy"" said.

As a reminder, Russia has recently made a new statement about negotiations with Ukraine and the goals of the ""SVO"". While Lavrov says that Ukraine and the West do not want to negotiate, and that Russia, like a professional ""tango dancer,"" is waiting for the consent of its ""partners,"" his subordinate, Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Riabkov, says the exact opposite.

According to Riabkov, Moscow is not ready to negotiate with Ukraine because it does not accept Ukrainian peace proposals. Moreover, the Kremlin understands the word ""negotiations"" in a very specific way - as the unconditional fulfillment by Ukraine and the West of all ultimatums put forward by Russia.

But the European Commission vice-president, Margaritis Schinas, added that Hamas had forfeited the right to be part of any political settlement.

The Israel Defense Forces resumed combat in Gaza after a tentative truce expired on Friday, with the IDF accusing Hamas of violating the terms of the temporary ceasefire by firing towards Israeli territory.

In an interview with Guardian Australia, Schinas said the war must be carried out “according to international law”, but he stopped short of making any assessment about compliance to date.

“Well, this is something that is not easy to establish when you discuss a situation thousands of miles away, either in an office in Brussels or in the parliament building in Canberra,” he said during a visit to Australia.

Schinas said the world must also “start thinking about the day after – the post-conflict horizon – where I think Australia and the European Union view things in the same way”.

He called for the international community to help create conditions for stability “so that Israel and Palestinians can live in peace and security in the clear perspective of a two-state solution”.

Schinas said that could include support “in terms of reconstruction, humanitarian assistance and building up structures of a new state”.

He said the EU had tripled humanitarian aid to Gaza and intended to play a supportive role after the conflict “and I understand that Australia is on the same wavelength”.

While pushing for a two-state solution, Schinas argued that there must be “no role for Hamas in any post-conflict horizon”.

“Hamas lost the right to be part of a post-conflict horizon on 7 October,” the former Greek politician said.

Schinas, whose responsibilities at the commission include fighting antisemitism, also vowed to step up the fight to counter growing prejudice.

“The Holocaust and the Shoa are the stain in Europe’s history; these are the darkest chapters of our history books and we are determined not to relive them,” he said.

The comments come amid increasing concerns about a fracturing of social cohesion in Australia, including rising levels of antisemitism and Islamophobia.

Family members of Israelis killed or kidnapped by Hamas reiterated during a visit to Australia this week that they wanted to make “a very strong distinction” between the terrorist group and the Palestinian people.

“They [Hamas] came to kill – they simply came to kill everybody,” said Tali Kizhner, whose son Segev, 22, was killed on 7 October at the Supernova music festival in Re’im.

“I have two kids at home – 17 years old and nine-and-a-half – and they deserve to live in a country where they can be allowed to go to dance and not be killed. And they have the right to live in the country when they can go out and come back home to their mums.

“Hatred is a disease and we do not want to be ill.”

The delegation of Israeli relatives and friends said they felt unsafe after a pro-Palestinian protest occurred on Wednesday night in the lobby of the Melbourne hotel where they were staying.

The demonstration prompted condemnation from Australian politicians, but the uproar also largely overshadowed a piece of good news for one member of the visiting Israeli delegation.

Mika Shani, 18, flew home early on Thursday after learning that her brother, Amit Shani, 16, had been freed when Hamas released another group of hostages in return for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

“I’m beyond happy,” she said.

The Israeli delegation visited Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday to share their stories with senior MPs, including the prime minister, Anthony Albanese.

The following day, a pro-Palestine delegation also visited Canberra to raise alarm about the “humanitarian catastrophe that is engulfing the whole of Gaza” and to urge MPs to back calls for a full ceasefire."

The meeting came hours after Israel announced a resumption of hostilities against Hamas and began military operations in southern Gaza.

While Mr. Modi called for ensuring regular humanitarian supplies to the Palestinian population, he did not call for a ceasefire. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who also met the PM in Dubai, made a strong appeal to end hostilities, calling the situation in Gaza an “epic humanitarian catastrophe”.

“Prime Minister expressed his condolences on the loss of lives in the October 7 terror attacks and welcomed the release of hostages,” said a press release issued by the Ministry of External Affairs detailing the discussions with Mr. Herzog. “[Mr. Modi] reiterated the need for continued and safe delivery of humanitarian aid for the affected population. He emphasised on India’s support for a two state solution and early and durable resolution of Israel Palestine issue through dialogue and diplomacy,” it added.

The PM also held informal talks with leaders from Jordan, Bahrain, and Qatar, and other regional leaders present during the day. The MEA added that the PM had “exchanged views on Israel-Hamas conflict” during a bilateral meeting with United Arab Emirates President Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

In a social media post, the Israeli President — who posted a photo of his meeting with Mr. Modi, as well as his meetings with leaders from the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Brazil — said that he had made Israel’s case for “self-defence”.

“This morning at the [climate summit], I met dozens of leaders from around the world,” Mr. Herzog wrote, adding that he spoke about how Hamas violated the ceasefire, which Israel claims was the reason it resumed military operations in Gaza.

“I repeated again and again the demand to place the release of the hostages at the very top of the international community’s agenda, alongside respect for the right of the State of Israel to defend itself,” he added.

In the past few days, Hamas has freed more than 100 hostages as a part of a negotiated deal with Israel. In exchange, Israel stopped bombing Gaza, released more than 200 Palestinian prisoners, and allowed aid trucks with much-needed food, fuel, and water to enter south Gaza. However, on Friday, Israel restarted the bombardment of Gaza and combat operations, citing rockets fired by Hamas. It has now told the residents of south Gaza to evacuate the area, including about a million people from the northern part of the enclave who are now taking shelter there.

On Friday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that he “deeply regretted” the resumption of hostilities in Gaza. “The return to hostilities only shows how important it is to have a true humanitarian ceasefire,” Mr. Guterres said in a statement.

The MEA said that Mr. Modi and Mr. Guterres had held talks in Dubai, but did not specifically mention the conflict. “Both leaders exchanged views on priorities and concerns of the Global South related to Climate Action, climate finance, technology and reforms of the multilateral governance and financial institutions, including the UN,” the MEA statement said."

1143736829,20231201,"(CP) The European Union's highest court has ruled that member state governments can prohibit public employees from wearing religious attire, such as Muslim female head coverings.

The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in the case of OP v. Commune d'Ans on Tuesday, siding with a Belgian municipality of Ans, which barred a Muslim woman from wearing a hijab while at work.

The EU court was asked whether the municipality's rules prohibiting public employees from wearing ""signs of conviction,"" like religious attire or political messages, violated the European Union's equality framework directive banning discrimination based on disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief and age in the workplace.

The court concluded that the rule was not directly discriminatory to Muslim women because it applied to ""any manifestation of belief, including religious belief, without distinction.""

""[T]he desire of a public body, such as the municipal authority, to pursue a policy of political, philosophical or religious neutrality is, in absolute terms, capable of constituting a legitimate aim,"" the court's opinion states.

The EU directive allows member states a ""margin of discretion"" to take ""account of the diversity of their approaches towards the place accorded to religion or belief within their respective systems,"" the court ruled, adding that states have discretion when it comes to maintaining a ""fair balance"" between ""achieving the necessary reconciliation of the different rights and interests concerned.""

The ruling drew strong condemnation from the Muslim rights group Council on American-Islamic Relations, which also urged the U.S. State Department to condemn the ruling. The group contends that such legislation meets the U.S. International Religious Freedom Act's definition of a religious freedom violation and warrants condemnation from the U.S. government.

""The Court of Justice of the European Union has trampled on the basic principles of religious freedom by denying Muslim women the right to wear a hijab at work,"" CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper said in a statement. ""This decision and past rulings in European nations clearly target Muslims and seek to eliminate expressions of Islam from public spaces.""

For the past several years, many European nations have debated whether to restrict or ban certain traditional Islamic head and face coverings for Muslim women, citing reasons such as adherence to secular principles and preserving national identity.

In 2011, for example, France passed a ban on wearing full-face veils in public that carried the punishment of fines and/or citizenship training. The European Court of Human Rights upheld the law in a 2014 decision.

John Dalhuisen, Europe and Central Asia Program director at Amnesty International, said in a statement that he believed the 2014 ruling was ""deeply disturbing to all those who value the freedom of expression.""

""If one strips the court's ruling to its barest essence, it is saying you cannot wear full-face veils because it makes people feel uncomfortable. This is not grounds to ban behaviour or a form of expression — religious or otherwise — that in itself does no harm to others,"" stated Dalhuisen at the time.

""[T]his ruling will end up forcing a small minority to live apart, as it effectively obliges women to choose between the expressing [of] their religious beliefs and being in public.""

The EU court ruling comes as assorted measures aimed at curbing religious expression among public employees in the United States are being removed.

In November, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a law that eliminated a 1949 measure that banned public school teachers from being allowed to wear religious attire.

Known as Senate Bill 84, the proposal had received overwhelming bipartisan support."

First reported a week ago, the disappearance of a fishing boat raised fears of new piracy activity in the northwestern Indian Ocean off Somalia and came days before the assault on the tanker Central Park, which the U.S. blamed on pirates.

Media reports in Somalia last week highlighted the of the ALMERAJ 1 possibly as a stateless vessel involved in illegal fishing activities. The report said that pirates had seized the fishing dhow and were demanding $400,000 in ransom while threatening to use the vessel as a mother ship for additional assaults on commercial shipping.

The European Union Naval Force Operation (EUNAVFOR) ATALANTA which monitors shipping to maintain security in the region reports it was informed of the incident on November 22 by the commander of the Somali Coast Guard. EUNAVFOR began investigating the reports of an abduction of what they are calling an Iranian-flagged fishing dhow off the coast of Eyl (Puntland, Somalia).

Operation ATALANTA monitored the dhow closely for more than 230 nautical miles away from the coast of Somalia. This included the deployment of an unarmed drone and the involvement of the EU embassy in Mogadishu and the Somali authorities. An Italian and a Spanish warship are currently deployed to the area of operation for Operation ATALANTA.

EUNAVFOR reports tracking the vessel including through the use of a drone (EUNAVFOR)

“Ultimately, having also lost its two towed skiffs in adverse weather, ALMERAJ 1 reversed course toward the Puntland coast and reached the Somalia territorial waters,” reports the command of the EU operation. After being closely monitored by ATALANTA units, they communicated its last known position to the Somali police forces. “Eventually, Somali police forces took over the escort to shore, and for following actions with regard to the suspected pirates.”

EUNAVFOR reports that the last piracy incident in the region took place in 2019. The operation remains vigilant to any maritime security events in its area. They also strongly recommend merchant and other vulnerable vessels register in the Maritime Security Centre - Horn of Africa's Voluntary Registration Scheme, to provide the most effective monitoring and response by ATALANTA forces and their partners in countering maritime security threats.

Operations and the registration requirements transitioned to a voluntary basis after the successful efforts reduced the risk and ended the frequent actions against merchant ships in the region. However, with renewed tensions across the region, the U.S. and UK issued new security warnings this week for all ships operating in the areas ranging from the Gulf of Aden, the Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf."

The top American and European diplomats, who were attending the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) summit in Europe, both left the event early because they were simply too afraid to engage in a frank and substantive dialog with Russia, RT quoted Lavrov as saying at a press conference in Skopje, North Macedonia, on Friday.

Lavrov told reporters after the OSCE summit that Blinken had left the ministerial meeting before his arrival, “fleeing” from the event.

The top Russian diplomat also noted that some local newspapers were trying to cast a shadow over Russia by publishing a photo of the summit’s participants with the Russian foreign minister conspicuously absent, in an apparent effort to convince the public that Moscow was isolated over the Ukraine conflict.

Lavrov explained that those pictures had been taken before the official opening of the summit, stressing that photos published on the next day showed all the participants, including the top Russian diplomat.

The top Russian diplomat pointed out that at the Skopje summit, foreign ministers from Ukraine, Poland and Baltic states were all absent, adding that, “I believe both Blinken and [top EU diplomat Josep] Borrell left as well. They might say that they are emphasizing their intention to isolate Russia, but I think they are just afraid, scared of an honest conversation with facts at hand.”

According to Lavrov, some European foreign ministers were trying to avoid talking about Western “shenanigans” aimed at denying Russian diplomats access to various international events, including UN and UNESCO meetings.

The Skopje summit had been boycotted by Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In a joint statement, the three countries claimed that Lavrov’s attendance at the event “risks legitimizing aggressor Russia as a rightful member of our community of free nations.” Polish Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek shared these countries’ position, saying that Warsaw could not ignore the fact that Lavrov “will be present at the table of the organization that is supposed to build peace and security in Europe.”

The top Russian diplomat, nonetheless, took part in the summit and held high-level meetings with several participants on the sidelines of the Skopje summit.

Lavrov also delivered an important speech to those at the summit, sounding the alarm for fellow European members that the OSCE had digressed into a “deplorable state” due to “short-sighted” choices that were made by some Western states.

In his address to the OSCE Ministerial Council on Thursday, Lavrov said the future of the OSCE is “unclear” and after decades of efforts to build the organization, it was now “on the brink of the abyss.”"
1143779178,20231201,"A famous work of street art has gone down with its ship.

In the coastal English town of Dover, a landmark piece by the long-celebrated street artist Banksy has been destroyed as a result of its building’s demolition — but parts of the work may still get another life, CNN reported.

The mural, which depicted a laborer breaking a star off the European Union’s blue and gold flag, appeared on the structure’s side in 2017, a year after the UK voted to withdraw from the EU.

It quickly became a tourist attraction, and was at one point valued to be worth over $1.2 million, before being whitewashed one 2019 night, according to CNN.

Attempts were made, unsuccessfully, to restore the mural, but it was ultimately determined to be too expensive for town residents. And now the building is gone, knocked down for a larger regeneration program.

“Prior to authorizing the demolition, and having taken professional conservation advice, [Dover City Council] determined that the Banksy could not be viably conserved without considerable costs to local taxpayers, even if it were technically possible,” a Dover City Council spokesperson told CNN in a statement.

Still, contractor DDS Demolition, which knocked down the building, “is attempting to see if the Banksy artwork can be conserved in any way,” according to a post about the regeneration program on the Council’s website.

“There is no certainty that this will be successful given the fact that the artwork was whitewashed and the poor state of the render,” the post adds.

DDS is meeting “all additional costs and risks that they incur in attempting to recover the Banksy,” it further notes. “Should their attempts be successful, any elements of the Banksy would be the property of DDS Demolition in line with the terms of the contract which, as is standard practice with demolition projects, gives them the ownership of any salvageable materials from the buildings.”"

1143781080,20231201,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Mandy Cohen told Congress on Thursday there is “no new or novel pathogen” behind the wave of pediatric respiratory illness spreading across China, so there is no reason for Americans to be concerned about a new virus escaping from China like the Wuhan coronavirus did.

Cohen concurred with Chinese doctors that northern China’s unusually severe cold and flu season, which has overwhelmed hospitals in Beijing and other cities, is not the work of some new illness.

“These [cases] are related to existing pathogens – COVID, flu, RSV and mycoplasma, a bacterium that can infect the lungs,” Cohen told the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on Thursday.

Cohen said this conclusion was supported by “other sources from our European Union partners and others to make sure that we are getting a complete picture.”

Some of the House subcommittee members noted similarities between the current outbreak and the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, which China also insisted was a minor local problem under complete control before it spread from Wuhan and ravaged the world.

“The lack of reliable information coming out of China is a troubling parallel to 2020,” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) said.

“We are hoping that you can put some pressure in an attempt to try to get China to not mislead the world as they did with Covid-19,” Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee chairman Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) told Cohen.

One reason for international apprehension about China’s respiratory virus outbreak was the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) seeming skepticism about early reports and requests for more data from China. W.H.O. appears to be satisfied with China’s response, but not everyone is satisfied with W.H.O., as the House committee members made clear.

McMorris Rodgers, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, cowrote a letter to Cohen the day before she testified criticizing CDC for its “failure to communicate accurate information in real-time during the Covid-19 pandemic.”

The letter, cowritten by Griffith and Subcommittee on Health chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY), said it was important for the CDC to restore the trust it lost with the American people during the coronavirus pandemic — beginning with full transparency about China’s current epidemic of respiratory illnesses.

The letter to Cohen said:

The letter asked several pointed questions about the CDC’s interactions with Chinese health officials, including how much data China has shared, and if Chinese officials refused to answer any questions. The letter also asked if the CDC has prepared for the possibility of respiratory diseases and pneumonia surging in the United States.

The Washington Post on Thursday quoted some independent health officials who agreed with Cohen and W.H.O. that no evidence of a novel pathogen has surfaced in China, although some of them agreed skepticism of China’s response is warranted.

“The problem remains there, so we cannot just categorically take wholesale what the government says. There’s no serious dialogue between the two governments on how they should be cooperating with each other,” Yanzhong Huang, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) senior fellow for Global Health, said.

The prevailing theory of the Chinese outbreak is that coronavirus lockdowns prevented the normal development of immune responses, leading to more cases of highly contagious respiratory illness. A similar effect has been observed on a smaller scale in the U.S., where lockdowns were not quite as severe as China’s infamous citywide imprisonments.

Cohen predicted respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases are approaching their peak in the United States, but flu season is just beginning, and Wuhan coronavirus infections are still leading to hospitalization. On Friday, Massachusetts joined Ohio in reporting a major surge in pediatric pneumonia cases. Massachusetts health officials attributed the surge to RSV.

Forbes noted that Thursday marked Cohen’s first testimony to Congress since she was appointed CDC director in June, replacing controversial pandemic-era director Rochelle Walensky. Cohen was generally defensive of CDC’s conduct during the pandemic under questioning by subcommittee Republicans.

1143786177,20231201,"(Reuters) - A Virgin Atlantic passenger jet powered by 100% SAF completed a London-to-New York jaunt on Tuesday, showcasing the potential of low-carbon options, which are a tiny fraction of the industry's fuel mix.

The flight is not the first time the industry has staged demonstrations to highlight its aspiration to reduce emissions - and appeal for government support. Indeed, Tuesday's flight carried only Virgin's billionaire founder, Richard Branson, and a few others, and it is set to return to London using conventional jet fuel.

Airlines are banking on fuel made from waste to reduce their emissions by up to 70%, but the high cost and tight supply of materials needed to make SAF make large-scale production difficult. SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of total global jet fuel in use today and costs three to five times as much as regular jet fuel.

The flight, operated by a Virgin Boeing 787 powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, is the first time a commercial airliner has flown long haul on 100% SAF. It had no paying passengers or cargo.

""It's going to take a while before we can get enough fuel where everybody's going to be able to fly. But you've got to start somewhere,"" said Branson in London before the plane took off.

Aviation is not an easy industry to decarbonize compared to road travel, and it accounts for an estimated 2-3% of global carbon emissions.

Engines in commercial use are not yet certified to fly on more than 50% SAF and the vast majority of flights blend in a much lower amount of SAF with traditional jet fuel.

SAF is already used in jet engines as part of a blend with traditional kerosene, but after successful ground tests, Virgin and its partners Rolls-Royce, Boeing, BP and others won permission to fly using only SAF from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Canadian and UK regulators.

The flight took off at 1149 GMT from London's Heathrow Airport with Branson, Virgin Atlantic Chief Executive Shai Weiss and Britain's transport minister, Mark Harper, on board. It landed at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport at 1405 EST (1905 GMT), 35 minutes early, where it was met by U.S. Deputy Transportation Secretary Polly Trottenberg, among others.

Harper told Reuters after landing in New York that the flight was uneventful.

""If you hadn't known it was a 100% SAF flight, no one would have noticed,"" he said, calling the flight a key milestone toward 100% SAF adoption. Data from the flight ""will be as close to running a regular flight as you can get.""

He and Trottenberg plan to meet Wednesday with the investor community in New York ""about what they look for when they invest in SAF production - are there any barriers, are there any market failures, are there things governments need to do to help get this stuff over the line.""

The fuel used to power Tuesday's flight is mostly made from used cooking oil and waste animal fat mixed with a small amount of synthetic aromatic kerosene made from waste corn, Virgin Atlantic said.

The industry hopes that the Virgin flight will highlight to governments the need for them to provide financial support to make SAF more readily available.

The key to decarbonizing long haul aviation is through SAF, and for that, everyone needs to share the burden, Weiss said. He added that going forward, prices for sustainable aviation fuel will increase and they'll ""have to share it with consumers, with businesses, with the oil majors"".

""What is urgently needed is to reduce the burning of fossil jet fuels, which means reducing flights wherever possible,"" said Magdalena Heuwieser, who represents the network.

A UK military version of the Airbus (AIR.PA) A330 airliner flew on the fuel last December, fuel supplier Air bp said. Dubai's Emirates said last week it had flown an A380, the world's largest airliner, using SAF for one of four engines.

Last week, a Gulfstream G600 business jet using the same fuel successfully crossed the Atlantic.

Many European airlines - including Virgin, IAG-owned British Airways, and Air France (AIRF.PA) - have said they want to be using 10% SAF by 2030. The industry's goal of ""net zero"" emissions by 2050 relies on that share rising to 65%.

Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgic said SAF was the only solution to decarbonise commercial flights in the medium term, but analysts say the 2030 target looks challenging given SAF's small volumes and its high cost.

Talking to a private television channel in a current affairs programme, the minister said the caretaker government would fulfill its legal and constitutional responsibilities by providing financial and administrative assistance as well as security to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for conducting the elections.

Rejecting rumours about the delay in elections, he said the ECP had already released the final lists of constituencies after completing the delimitation exercise across the country.

Solangi said conditions and environment were conducive to hold the elections in the country. “All political parties will be given 54 days for their election campaign,” he added.

He said the caretaker government wanted the country to be led by its representatives in accordance with the law and constitution. It was clearly stated in the preamble of the Constitution that the country would be run by elected representatives.

On February 8, the people of Pakistan would make their decision that who would lead them, he added.

 “If any political party faces any injustice, they have the right to file a complaint,” he said, adding all the state institutions were working freely in the country.

To a query, he said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf freely holding its conventions in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

 “No minister of the caretaker government or any of their close relative would contest the election,” the minister categorically stated.

To another query, he said the caretaker government was mandated to assist the ECP for holding elections in accordance with law and the Constitution.

He said the results of elections would not be monitored by the independent observers only but also by the media which would be playing a crucial role in this regard.

Ruling out any chances of rigging in the upcoming elections, he said over 150 million people with mobile phones in the country were nothing less than a broadcaster.

He said the European Union had issued its final report on 2018 election results that detailed irregularities in the polls.

 The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) was established during the tenure of the previous government, the minister said, adding the initiative would continue to pay dividends in future.

The SIFC had full legal and constitutional cover, he said in response to another query."

1143790744,20231202,"The joint EU-sponsored force responsible for maritime security along the East African coast including Somalia reports that it has tracked and provided details to the Somali police forces for follow-up on the recent security incident. First reported a week ago, the disappearance of a fishing boat raised fears of new piracy activity in the northwestern Indian Ocean off Somalia and came days before the assault on the tanker Central Park, which the U.S. blamed on pirates.

Media reports in Somalia last week highlighted the of the ALMERAJ 1 possibly as a stateless vessel involved in illegal fishing activities. The report said that pirates had seized the fishing dhow and were demanding $400,000 in ransom while threatening to use the vessel as a mother ship for additional assaults on commercial shipping.

The European Union Naval Force Operation (EUNAVFOR) ATALANTA which monitors shipping to maintain security in the region reports it was informed of the incident on November 22 by the commander of the Somali Coast Guard. EUNAVFOR began investigating the reports of an abduction of what they are calling an Iranian-flagged fishing dhow off the coast of Eyl (Puntland, Somalia).

Operation ATALANTA monitored the dhow closely for more than 230 nautical miles away from the coast of Somalia. This included the deployment of an unarmed drone and the involvement of the EU embassy in Mogadishu and the Somali authorities. An Italian and a Spanish warship are currently deployed to the area of operation for Operation ATALANTA.

“Ultimately, having also lost its two towed skiffs in adverse weather, ALMERAJ 1 reversed course toward the Puntland coast and reached the Somalia territorial waters,” reports the command of the EU operation. After being closely monitored by ATALANTA units, they communicated its last known position to the Somali police forces. “Eventually, Somali police forces took over the escort to shore, and for following actions with regard to the suspected pirates.”

EUNAVFOR reports that the last piracy incident in the region took place in 2019. The operation remains vigilant to any maritime security events in its area. They also strongly recommend merchant and other vulnerable vessels register in the Maritime Security Centre - Horn of Africa's Voluntary Registration Scheme, to provide the most effective monitoring and response by ATALANTA forces and their partners in countering maritime security threats.

Operations and the registration requirements transitioned to a voluntary basis after the successful efforts reduced the risk and ended the frequent actions against merchant ships in the region. However, with renewed tensions across the region, the U.S. and UK issued new security warnings this week for all ships operating in the areas ranging from the Gulf of Aden, the Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf."

1143816986,20231202,"A logo of the COP28 is pictured ahead of the United Nations climate summit in Dubai on November 28, 2023. The UN chief urged world leaders to take decisive action to tackle ever-worsening climate change when they gather at the COP28 summit in Dubai starting this week.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — More than 110 countries want the COP28 climate negotiations to adopt a goal of tripling renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency by 2030, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday.

The European Union first appealed for the new target earlier this year, and the cause has since been taken up by COP28 hosts the United Arab Emirates, then the G7 and G20 groups of nations.

G20 nations alone account for nearly 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Von der Leyen told leaders at the UN climate talks in Dubai that it was ""fantastic"" that more than 110 nations had already embraced the goal.

""I call now on all of us to include these targets in the final COP decision, because this sends a strong message to investors and consumers alike,"" she said from the podium.

The discussions about the renewables goal are both separate but closely linked to far more difficult negotiations about whether a final COP28 deal will commit nations to phasing down -- or phasing out -- all fossil fuels.

In September, when G20 nations committed to ""encourage efforts"" towards tripling renewables capacity, their final statement remained silent about the future role played by fossil fuels, which account for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions.

All credible pathways for achieving global carbon neutrality by mid-century depend on massively scaling up wind, solar, hydroelectric and other renewable energies such as biomass to displace the demand for planet-heating oil, gas and coal.

This is ""the single most important lever"" for reducing carbon pollution from burning fossil fuels, and capping warming under the Paris Agreement's ambitious threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with the pre-industrial period, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said.

There has already been progress. Between 2015 and 2022, renewable capacity increased on average by 11 percent each year.

Against a backdrop of soaring oil prices and energy insecurity linked to the war in Ukraine, the IEA forecasts unprecedented growth of about 30 percent in 2023.

Not all countries will have to make the same efforts to slash emissions. Of the 57 nations analysed by the think tank Ember, more than half were on track to meet or exceed their 2030 targets.

But other large emitters such as Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates still have plenty of room for improvement."
1143824216,20231202,"In a landmark decision on the very first day of the COP28 summit in the United Arab Emirates, nearly 200 nations rallied to create a ""loss and damage"" fund, a significant stride toward supporting countries like Nepal that are grappling with the severe consequences of global warming. The urgency of this moment cannot be overstated, especially as the UN has warned that 2023 is poised to become the hottest year in human history. The establishment of this fund is undoubtedly a historic achievement. But it is imperative to underscore the critical need for substantial funding and simplified operational processes to effectively address the climate damage faced by nations, particularly echoing the concerns raised by Nepal. President Sultan Al Jaber's proclamation that the decision is evidence that COP28 can deliver raises expectations. However, mere establishment without robust financial commitments and streamlined operations will not translate into tangible relief for the vulnerable nations. The need for expedited action to transition to clean energy and curb emissions is apparent, yet a central focus of COP28 remains the stocktake of global progress, an evaluation that must be met with concrete steps and not just rhetoric.

The financial commitments made by the UAE and the European Union, though commendable, fall notably short of the $100 billion demanded by developing nations. While the announced $100 million from the UAE and $246 million from the EU are steps in the right direction, they are a fraction of the $400 billion annually estimated by the Loss and Damage Collaborators to effectively address climate damage. These pledges should be seen as initial contributions, not the final commitment. The scale of the climate crisis demands a substantial and sustained financial commitment from the wealthier nations responsible for the majority of emissions. Nepal, in particular, has been vocal about the necessity for the establishment of the fund but emphasizes the need for a simplified operational process. Dr. Deepak Kharal, secretary at the Ministry of Forests and Environment, rightly points out that while the long-standing demand has been fulfilled, the operational process requires streamlining. The lessons learned from the committee formed in Egypt and its subsequent recommendations should guide the operationalization of the fund to ensure efficiency, transparency, and equitable distribution of resources.

The disparity between the funds demanded and the contributions pledged highlights the urgent need to mobilize more substantial financial commitments. Climate experts rightly warn against letting the announcement of a few million dollars overshadow the actual requirement of $1.5 trillion. This is not a time for token gestures; it is a moment to acknowledge the enormity of the challenge and act accordingly. International organizations advocating for climate justice, like ActionAid International, rightly emphasize that while the establishment of the fund is an important step, it is only the beginning. Climate disasters continue to escalate, necessitating ongoing, substantial financial support. The fund must not be seen as a one-time solution but as a sustained commitment to mitigating and addressing the evolving impacts of climate change. COP28's decision to establish the Climate Damage Fund is a historic moment, but the real work lies ahead. Mobilizing adequate funds, simplifying operational processes, and ensuring that wealthier nations meet their commitments are non-negotiable steps for COP28 to deliver on its promise. The urgency of the climate crisis demands nothing less than a concerted and immediate global effort. The world is watching, and future generations depend on our collective resolve to address the climate challenges we face today."

The distinguished gathering also included Her Excellency Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and His Excellency Ajay Banga, President of the World Bank.

Expressing gratitude to the European Union for organizing the event, President Hichilema underscored the vital role of the EU’s support to Zambia, particularly in terms of institutional and technical capacity aligning with the Paris initiative on carbon markets. The President emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts in addressing global climate challenges.

During his keynote intervention, President Hichilema shared Zambia’s commitment to environmental sustainability. He revealed that Zambia has implemented a national climate adaptation policy, actively promoting the development of carbon markets. Furthermore, he highlighted ongoing legislative efforts to address climate change, with specific provisions aimed at advancing the country’s engagement in carbon markets.

President Hichilema stressed the significance of ensuring that rural communities, heavily reliant on natural resources, are actively involved in carbon projects. He asserted that for meaningful participation, it is crucial to clearly define and demonstrate the benefits of carbon markets to these communities.

“We believe that for carbon markets to truly contribute to sustainable development, it is imperative that the benefits are accessible and well-defined, particularly for our rural communities whose livelihoods depend on natural resources,” President Hichilema stated.

President Hichilema concluded by affirming his commitment to further engagements at the event, expressing optimism that these discussions will lead to positive outcomes that benefit not only Zambia but also its citizens, particularly those in rural areas."

More than 20 nations including the United States called for a tripling of nuclear energy to drive down emissions on Saturday as world leaders assembled for a second day at UN climate talks in Dubai.

With smoggy skies in Dubai highlighting the challenges facing the world, other pledges are expected at the COP28 conference, including stepping up the deployment of renewable energy and cutting methane emissions.

The use of nuclear power as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels is highly controversial as environmental groups are concerned about safety and the disposal of nuclear waste.

But more than 20 nations ranging from the US to Ghana, Japan and several European countries said in a declaration that it plays a ""key role"" in the global goal of achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century.

They called for the tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050 from 2020 levels.

""We are not making the argument to anybody that this is absolutely going to be a sweeping alternative to every other energy source,"" US climate envoy John Kerry said at the COP28 conference in Dubai.

""But we know because the science and the reality of facts and evidence tell us that you can't get to net zero 2050 without some nuclear,"" he said.

The other signatories include Britain, France, South Korea, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates, but nuclear powers Russia and China did not sign up.

Environmental group 350.org said the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 in Japan highlighted the dangers of atomic power.

""While we appreciate that the Biden administration is looking to invest in alternatives to fossil fuels, we don't have time to waste on dangerous distractions like nuclear energy,"" said its North American director Jeff Ordower.

The declaration came as more world leaders took the stage at COP28 for the second day in a row, though US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are skipping the talks.

""We want to make the energy transition a global success story. It has to be now,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.

""We all have to demonstrate the same determination to phase out fossil fuels, beginning with coal,"" he said.

Nations at the COP28 talks are also expected to adopt a goal of tripling renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency by 2030.

The European Union first appealed for the new targets earlier this year, and the cause has since been taken up by COP28 hosts the UAE, then the G7 and G20 groups of nations.

The discussions about the renewables goal are closely linked to far more difficult negotiations about whether a final COP28 deal will commit nations to phasing down—or phasing out—all fossil fuels.

The United States and China, the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, and the UAE will host later Saturday a summit on methane emissions.

Methane, a non-CO gas, is the second largest contributor to climate change, accounting for around 16 percent of the warming effect.

China agreed for the first time to include all greenhouse gases in its next national climate pledge for 2035 in an agreement with the US last month.

But Beijing has stopped short of joining a US-backed Global Methane Pledge that has been signed by more than 150 countries and seeks to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030.

Methane ""is the most destructive gas"", Kerry said."

Brazil who is handing the Mercosur rotating chair to Paraguay during a ceremony and regional summit in Rio do Janeiro next 7 December´, is working overtime to finalize important milestones for the trade block during its presidency, among which discussions with UAE, closing a deal with Singapore, making official Bolivia's incorporation and equally outstanding even possibly signing the definitive agreement with the European Union.

The signing of the agreement with Singapore is already on the summit agenda, a great advance since it is the first reached with a Southeast Asian country, allowing for the expansion of trade and investment with a hub that is center piece of the most dynamic economic area of the globe.

As to Bolivia's incorporation as full member of Mercosur, formalities are in the process of completion: the Brazilian senate approved the treaty earlier this week, and it has all been arranged for the Bolivian parliament to make the official approval during the regional summit next week in Rio. Bolivia will thus become the sixth member of Mercosur, together with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela currently suspended for its repeated disruption of the democratic institutions and order.

But as Valor Economico points out, the trade and cooperation agreement with the European Union after more than two decades pending, has been recently beginning to move under Brazilian impulse and positive prospects from the incoming Argentine government, decisively in favor of open markets and free trade.

In effect European negotiators who are in Brazil have held meetings in Brasília and a new round is scheduled in Rio. “It will be days of intense mobilization in the technical area and at the highest political spheres,” revealed a Brazilian diplomat.

The trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA, formed by Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein) is also expected to be finalized. Due to the concentration of efforts on negotiations with the EU, the signing may be postponed and take place under the presidency of Paraguay, which takes over the bloc during the summit. Discussions on other free trade agreements are also planned, including the United Arab Emirates.

As to more internal issues of the block, Brazil is expected to settle most of its debts to Mercosur institutions, in particular the payment of more than US$ 90 million to the Structural Convergence Fund for Mercosur (FOCEM), a joint financing mechanism for member countries that aims to reduce asymmetries and promote the weaker economies.

During the previous administration of president Bolsonaro, Brazil suspended debts and commitments with various international organizations, given its erratic foreign policy and disregard for Mercosur and lack of chemistry with some regional leaders..

Another important factor in the current equation has been president elect Javier Milei’s victory in Argentina, which prompted Lula da Silva to intensify efforts to conclude the agreement with the European Union during Brazil’s Mercosur presidency.

During a visit to Brazil over the weekend, the future Argentine foreign minister, Diana Mondino, (and despite Milei having labeled Lula da Silva a 'communist'), gave assurances that the incoming administration is interested in the agreement and will not stand in the way of the process.

“The new Argentine government supports this effort and we are now working intensively with Spain that currently holds the presidency of the European Union,” said Ms Mondino. Allegedly the future minister also presented Lula with a personal invitation to attend Milei's taking office ceremony, who had anticipated he was offended because he had been accused of being a 'communist' .

However it´s not a trail of roses since European countries continue questioning environmental issues, which had been holding up the conclusion of the agreement. Still on the agenda are discussions about the criteria that will be adopted to comply with the European anti-deforestation law, which bans the import, from the end of 2024, of commodities grown in recently cleared forest areas."
1143854077,20231202,"(IN BRIEF) The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group has introduced the EU4Business Guarantee Facility, in collaboration with the European Investment Fund, aimed at supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in Eastern Partnership countries, including Armenia. This initiative provides partial portfolio guarantees to local banks and financial intermediaries, allowing them to offer SMEs favorable financing terms with reduced collateral requirements. Backed by an 80% guarantee on each loan, the facility is expected to unlock over €250 million in additional financing for SMEs, contributing to job creation and economic opportunities in the target countries. The European Union is providing €40 million in financial support for this initiative, which aligns with the EU’s efforts to promote economic resilience and sustainable development in the region. The EU4Business Guarantee Facility succeeds its previous phase, extending its geographical reach to five Eastern Partnership countries.

(PRESS RELEASE) LUXEMBOURG, 2-Dec-2023— /EuropaWire/ — The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group launched the EU4Business Guarantee Facility, in line with the Global Gateway strategy. The facility provides partial portfolio guarantees to local banks and other financial intermediaries in Armenia and other Eastern Partnership countries.

By providing an 80% guarantee on each loan, the facility will enable participating financial intermediaries in these countries to offer finance to local small and medium businesses (SMEs) on favourable terms, including reduced collateral requirements. Implemented jointly with the European Investment Fund, it is expected to unlock at least €250 million of additional financing for SMEs, ultimately sustaining jobs and new business opportunities in the target countries.

The European Union is providing €40 million of financial support for the facility under its EU4Business initiative covering EU-funded programmes devoted to SMEs in Eastern Partnership region.

The facility succeeds the previous EU4Business Guarantee Facility – Phase I, extending its geographical coverage to five Eastern Partnership countries. Building on the success of Phase I, which facilitated a €472 million debt finance portfolio with a focus on SMEs in Ukraine, this new phase demonstrates the EIB Group’s continued commitment to promoting economic resilience and development in the region.

The facility is instrumental for the Economic and Investment Plan for the Eastern Partnership, through which the European Union aims to support the partner countries’ socioeconomic recovery while pursuing the green and digital transitions.

The EIB Group presented the new EU4Business Guarantee Facility and ongoing Armenian Economic Resilience Programme to Armenian banks at an event hosted by the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA), a long-standing EIB partner. The EIB and the CBA recently signed the fourth financing agreement under the programme, amounting to €70 million. Thanks to this loan, financial intermediaries and SMEs can also receive technical assistance funded by the Eastern Partnership Technical Assistance Trust Fund and Green Financial Systems Programme. This operation builds on the success of three previous lines of credit totalling €150 million to facilitate access to finance for Armenian SMEs.

As highlighted by CBA Governor Martin Galstyan, “The EIB and the CBA initiated financial collaboration in 2014 that has proven to be highly successful. This partnership significantly boosted Armenia’s private sector by channelling funds through financial institutions to SMEs, creating more than 4 000 jobs. The new €70 million loan facility has set ambitious goals, aiming to support SME investments in green projects, women’s empowerment, business process automation and digitalisation. For this new phase, ten partner financial institutions have already been selected as intermediaries for the facility.

The CBA also welcomes the EIB Group’s initiative to launch the EU4Business Guarantee Facility in Armenia for the first time and encourages financial institutions to use this credit risk sharing opportunity to build a new portfolio of SME debt transactions.”

EIB Vice-President Teresa Czerwińska, responsible for operations in Armenia, remarked, “Support for SMEs is one of the EIB Group’s key priorities because, by funding them, we are boosting economic development, innovation and employment. With EU financial support, we are delighted to launch this new facility to enhance access to crucial financing so that SMEs can continue to develop new projects and generate growth.”

Ambassador Vassilis Maragos, Head of the EU Delegation to Armenia, explained, “Financial inclusion fuels economic growth and reduces poverty. That’s why the European Union and the EIB have created a guarantee facility — it opens doors for more Armenian SMEs to secure financing and growth. This facility will bring additional resources contributing to the implementation of the EU Economic and Investment Plan for Armenia. We’re happy to see the Armenian banking sector’s strong interest in this initiative. “

 The mayors included those of Accra, Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi, Ningo-Prampram, and Awutu Senya East.



 ""Today's roundtable is a testament to our collective resolve in tackling climate challenges head-on. It is crucial that these local insights and experiences from Ghana were brought forth at the upcoming COP28 to ensure global climate strategies resonate with local realities,"" he stated.



 Mr Razaaly, highlighting the significance of the gathering, stated that 70 per cent of the emissions that cause climate change occur in cities and municipalities, and that ""all municipalities in the world share the same concern.""



 He noted that the meeting provided an opportunity to exchange notes and better prepare Accra's Mayor, who is representing all West African cities at COP28, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.



 The meeting also examined what the EU was presently doing jointly with Ghana to effectively address the issue of climate change adaptation.



 He stated that the EU and its Member States were the leaders in climate financing, spending 40 billion Euros globally to meet adaptation and mitigation activities.



 The EU, according to the Ambassador, aspires to cut its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030 and has asked the world's largest economies to join the effort.



 The roundtable was as part of the EU Climate Diplomacy Week, aimed at addressing the pressing issue of climate Change challenges amid rising urbanization and population growth.



 The European Union Climate Change Diplomacy Week is part of the EU and its Member States' annual global drive to strengthen cooperation on climate change and inspire genuine action.



 The 2023 COP28, which will be held from November 30 to December 12, at the Expo City, Dubai, is aimed at promoting the use of carbon pricing as a cost-effective tool to reduce emissions and raise revenue to finance the green transition.



 It would also urge governments to move forward with the implementation of loss and damage financing mechanisms, including the establishment of a fund.



 Ms Elizabeth Sackey, the Mayor of Accra said, ""this roundtable has been a powerful platform for us to unite our voices and concerns.""



 ""As we approach COP28, it is clear that the challenges we face in Accra are shared by many, and together, we can advocate for meaningful global action and support"" she said.



 Other participants at the roundtable included Ms Anita Love Obo Amissah, Municipal Chief Executive of Awutu-Senya East Municipality, Mr Yohane Amarh Ashitey, Mayor of Tema Metropolitan Assembly, Mr Innocent Haligah, Metropolitan Coordinating Director, Sekondi- Takoradi Metropolitan Assembly and Mr Al- Latiff Tetteh Amanor, District Chief Executive of Ningo-Prampram District Assembly.



 The mayors are members of the Covenant of Mayors in Sub-Saharan Africa (CoM SSA) initiative, which recognises the urgency and importance of collaborating to find sustainable solutions.



 The mayors intend to implement comprehensive strategies to combat climate change at the local level.



 These includes a focus on sustainable urban planning, green infrastructure development, energy efficiency, waste management, and adopting climate-smart technologies.



 CoM SSA is the regional chapter of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCOM), the largest global initiative of cities addressing climate and energy challenges. This bottom-up initiative encourages cities to voluntarily set and achieve ambitious yet realistic climate and energy targets."

Methane emissions are a significant contributor to global warming, so sharply reducing them could help slow temperature rise. If the companies carry out their pledges, it could trim one-tenth of a degree Celsius (0.18 degrees Fahrenheit) from future warming, a prominent climate scientist calculated and told The Associated Press. That is about how much the Earth is currently warming every five years.

The announcement by Sultan al-Jaber, president of the climate summit known as COP28 and head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., comes as he and others have insisted his background would allow him to bring oil companies to the negotiating table. Al-Jaber has maintained that having the industry’s buy-in is crucial to drastically slashing the world’s greenhouse emissions by nearly half in seven years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times.

Signing on to the pledge were major national oil companies such as Saudi Aramco, Brazil’s Petrobras and Sonangol, from Angola, and multi-nationals like Shell, TotalEnergies and BP.

“The world does not work without energy,” said al-Jaber, speaking in a session on the oil industry. “Yet the world will break down if we do not fix energies we use today, mitigate their emissions at a gigaton scale, and rapidly transition to zero carbon alternatives.”

As if anticipating critiques, al-Jaber added: “Is it enough? Hear me out, please. No, it’s not enough. I say with full passion and conviction, I know that much more can be done.”

For months leading up to COP28, there was speculation of action on methane. Not only do methane leaks, along with flaring, which is burning of excess methane, and venting of the gas, all contribute to climate change, but these problems can largely be solved with current technologies and changes to operations. Indeed, oil and gas companies could have taken such measures years ago but largely have not, instead focusing more on expanding production than focusing on the byproduct of it.

In that way, the methane deal represented a potentially significant contribution to combatting climate change that also largely maintained the status quo for the oil and gas industry. Many environmental groups were quick to criticize it.

The pledge is a “smokescreen to hide the reality that we need to phase out oil, gas and coal,” said a letter signed by more than 300 civil society groups.

Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said “the commitments to cut methane are significant, but they address the symptom, not the source.”

But Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp said Saturday’s deal “could be the single most impactful day of announcements from any COP in my 30 years at the Environmental Defense Fund.”

Methane has caused about half of the world’s warming since pre-industrial times, al-Jaber said, promoting the deal as significant. However, methane escaping from oil and gas drilling is only about 23% of the world’s methane emissions, with agriculture and waste being bigger culprits, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, the climate scientist who calculated the proposal would trim a tenth of a degree from future warming.

“It would be a significant, but not a fundamental contribution” to making sure average temperatures don’t rise beyond 1.5 degrees, Hare said. To keep within that limit, the world needs to cut carbon dioxide about 40% and methane by about 60% by 2030, he said.

Methane can be released at several points along the operation of an oil and gas company, from fracking to when natural gas is produced, transported or stored. Over a shorter period, it’s 86 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. However, methane stays in the air only a couple decades — unlike thousands of years for carbon dioxide — so reducing methane faster is “low-hanging fruit” because it’s easier and changes future warming more, al-Jaber said.

Marcelo Mena, CEO of Global Methane Hub, an alliance of philanthropies and organizations focused on reducing methane emissions, said that having near-zero methane emission commitments should not be seen as delaying a phase out of fossil fuels, as some environmental groups claimed.

“We wouldn’t let oil companies leak into the ocean until phase out, so why would we let them leak out methane to super charge climate change?” said Mena, a former environment minister in Chile.

Still, Mena said that self-reporting didn’t go far enough to push oil and gas companies to make changes. Instead, he said putting a price on pollution, or companies finding themselves shut out of markets that require high standards with leaks, would force change.

Stricter regulations are beginning to take hold. On Saturday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a final rule aimed at reducing methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants generated by the oil and gas industry. It targets emissions from existing oil and gas wells nationwide. Previous EPA regulations only focused on new wells. It also regulates smaller wells that will be required to find and plug methane leaks.

The United States will now have “the strongest methane regulations in the world,” White House climate adviser John Podesta told the AP.

Earlier this year, European Union negotiators reached a deal to reduce methane emissions from the energy industry across the 27-member bloc. The agreement bans routine venting and flaring, and mandates strict reporting. By 2027, it will expand those norms to oil and gas exporters outside the bloc.

Saturday’s announcement did not address the oil and natural gas being burned off by the end users, so-called Scope 3 emissions, which can be motorists in their cars or plants powering cities. In his speech, al-Jaber said oil and gas companies needed to do more to research solutions to Scope 3 emissions.

The Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter is backed by both the United Arab Emirates and neighboring Saudi Arabia, two OPEC heavyweights. Saudi Arabia’s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, makes it one of the world’s least expensive places to produce crude. Both Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC and Aramco, the world’s third-most-valuable company, have signed onto the pledge.

Separately, organizers said more than 100 countries have signed onto a pledge to triple the world’s installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, something pledged in September by leaders of the so-called Group of 20. Their countries emit 80% of all planet-warming gases.

The Ministry of Emergency Situations for the Sakhalin Region said the Boeing 777 aircraft carrying 4 crew members and 408 passengers had a warning about a drop in pressure in one of the landing gear wheels during the flight.

An Aeroflot plane flying from Moscow was forced to make an emergency landing on Friday, the latest in a string of such incidents to hit Russia’s sanctions-stricken aviation industry in recent weeks.

Several similar incidents have been reported in recent months – in August, passengers on a Red Wings flight were stuck in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg for 24 hours due to simultaneous “technical malfunctions” on the only two available aircraft.

The same month a Russian Pegas Fly plane was delayed in Thailand due to faults with its weather monitoring system.

At the start of October, the state airline Aeroflot suffered three technical failures to its planes in a single day.

The latest incident comes just a few days after hack of Kremlin records revealed Russia’s airline industry is “on the verge of collapse” due to inadequate spare parts, uncertified repair services, and other systemic maintenance problems caused by sanctions.

Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense (HUR) posted the details of its latest “special cyber operation” on its Telegram channel.

This action was a hack into Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency “Rosaviatsiya” computer system on which it records all data relating to flight safety records, including reports on “emergency events.”

The huge volume of data obtained by HUR covered more than eighteen months’ worth of records from 2022 and 2023.

Their analysis of the information obtained led the intelligence staff to one inescapable conclusion – Russia’s civil aviation “is on the verge of collapse.”

Why is it collapsing?

The majority of planes operated by Russian airlines are made by either Airbus or Boeing, Western companies that have stopped doing business with Russia.

The main problems for Russian airlines center around engine maintenance and computerized control systems.

The sector, heavily reliant on international suppliers, has been among the hardest hit by Western sanctions resulting from Moscow's assault on Ukraine.

Cut off from Europe's Airbus and US-based Boeing, Russian airlines are facing particular trouble securing and maintaining both the physical parts and advanced software needed to keep planes in the air, experts say.

What have been the wider effects on the industry?

S7, Russia's largest private airline, will reduce the number of flights by 10-15 percent over the 2023-2024 autumn/winter period due to maintenance problems concerning the US-made engines for its Airbus planes, Russian media reported.

Unable to secure original parts for their Western-made jets, Russian companies have resorted to cannibalizing their existing fleet – grounding entire planes to strip them for parts.

Such a solution is seen as merely a short-term fix.

What has the Kremlin said?

The Kremlin has acknowledged that all is not well in Russia's aviation industry.

“We are facing new challenges, and we are looking for new ways to resolve them,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, when asked about the headwinds buffeting Russia's aviation sector.

Russian politicians have pinned their hopes on domestic manufacturers building hundreds of planes to replace the Western models.

But Russia's recent record in aircraft making is erratic.

The country's main post-Soviet model – the Sukhoi Superjet – had already earned a reputation as being prone to breakdowns and accidents even before Western sanctions kicked-in.

Plans for a new medium-haul jet, the Irkut MS-21, have fallen far behind schedule. In April, a Russian airline association expressed concern over the slow production schedule for new domestic planes that they need to replace their Western-made fleet.

“Maintaining the airworthiness of the foreign aircraft we have requires significant expenditure,” the Russian Association of Air Transport Operators said in a report.

Unless Moscow succeeds in either circumventing Western sanctions to secure aircraft parts or flying under-maintained planes, Russia's fleet numbers could drop by more than a third – from 850 to 554 – by 2033, analysts at consultancy Oliver Wyman say.

What happens if Russia can’t fix things?

Russia is no stranger to air disasters as a result of pressure on the industry.

The country saw a string of crashes that killed hundreds in the 1990s and early 2000s, due to an ageing Soviet fleet and poorly maintained aircraft.

Permanently cutting down on air travel altogether is also a non-starter in a country that spans 11 time zones. Western countries, including the European Union, US and Britain, have banned Russian airlines from operating in their airspace.

So far, domestic air traffic inside Russia has not markedly fallen since the start of Russia's offensive on Ukraine.

The Aviation Safety Network (ASN) also reported the number of aviation incidents in Russia over the period has stayed within the range recorded in previous years.

But as time passes, the risks are likely to increase."

1143892903,20231202,"DUBAI, Dec 2, 2023 (BSS/AFP) - More than 110 countries have signed up to a 

 commitment to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030, the COP28 

 climate talks UAE hosts said Saturday.

The countries will ""work together"" to bring global renewable energy 

 generation capacity to at least 11,000 gigawatts by the end of the decade, 

 said the COP28 presidency in Dubai.

""They also commit to work together in order to collectively double the global 

 average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements"" to more than four 

 percent per year, it said.

COP28 president Sultan Al Jaber said 117 countries had signed up, one more 

 than previously announced by the hosts of UN negotiations, though the final 

 number was expected to grow.

""But I do need more, and I'm kindly requesting all parties to come on board 

 as soon as possible please. This can and will help transition the world away 

 from unabated coal,"" Jaber said.

The European Union first appealed for the new target earlier this year, and 

 the cause has since been taken up by COP28 hosts the United Arab Emirates, 

 then the G7 and G20 groups of nations.

However, the commitments are non-binding.

Scaling up wind, solar and other renewable energies are crucial to the global 

 goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The pledge to triple renewable energy sends ""a very strong message to 

 investors and financial markets"" that ""the whole world is moving towards that 

 goal"", European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told AFP.

""I'm confident that we will reach that goal. The point where we still have to 

 work very hard (on) is speed,"" she said.

The nearly 200 nations negotiating a COP28 climate deal face tougher talks 

 over the next two weeks on the fate of fossil fuels."

1143905045,20231202,"President Bola Tinubu on Saturday pledged Nigeria’s commitment to end gas-flaring as part of its contribution to the global push to reduce methane emissions.

“We are committed to critical steps to reduce methane emissions by ensuring gas flaring is eliminated, There is a huge penalty for that. There is equally a huge incentive to do so,” Tinubu told world leaders on Saturday at the COP28 Summit on Methane and Other Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gases,’ in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.

Tinubu spoke alongside the COP28 President, Dr. Ahmed Al-Jaber; the United States Special Envoy on Climate, John Kerry, and the Chinese Envoy on Climate, Xie Zhenhua, saying Nigeria has incentives and punitive measures to encourage compliance and punish defaulters.

Commending the Emirati government for its drive to reduce GHGs, the President welcomed new developments made by the entities, harping on the need for participants to implement their net zero commitments.

“Sitting here in this room, I know that we have to commit ourselves. We have been doing so before today.

“The measures that are taken here are a welcome development, no doubt about that. I am with the leadership of the UAE for the commitment shown so far.

“We are consolidating on gas export, usage domestically and export to other countries. I can assure you that we will be partners in progress to achieve renewable energy,” said Tinubu.

Tinubu who spoke in his capacity as leader of Africa’s largest economy and the most populous black race then enumerated practical steps Nigeria has taken toward the global goal.

He remarked, “We are committed to energy mix, we are providing cooking gas for our large population. We will continue to do that.

“We have signed off on the reduction of methane. We will leverage new technology and we hope that the two giant nations and the Emirates will be able to help us.”

Tinubu called out the world’s biggest economies, the US and China, who he said are the biggest culprits in GHG emissions, urging them to act “real fast” because the earth needs urgent healing.

“What I know of Africa is the fact that de-risking in additional investment and technological know-how is very necessary and the largest economies that have benefitted immensely should do more real fast because the earth needs healing and needs more attention,” he affirmed.

Speaking earlier, COP28 President Sultan Al-Jaber opined that the efforts made so far prove that success is possible in the objective to limit rising temperatures.

He argued that eliminating all CO2 gases is possible with the necessary cooperation and hard work on the part of the countries.

Meanwhile, US Envoy, Kerry announced over $1bn new grant funding mobilised since COP27 in Sharm el-Shiekh, Egypt.

He enthused over more countries such as Turkmenistan who have made new methane pledge endorsements.

“Earlier today, the United States finalized standards to sharply reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations. And those efforts will achieve a nearly 80 per cent reduction and we, the United States, are planning a rulemaking review on methane emission standards for landfills.

“The United States and the European Union launched a global methane pledge two years ago in Glasgow, with 100 countries joining. At COP 27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, we were able to grow the list of endorsements to 150 countries.

“And I’m pleased today to announce a new global methane pledge endorsements from Angola, Kenya and Romania. And I’m particularly excited that Turkmenistan Kazakhstan joined yesterday and Kosovo President Costco is here to join today. We’re working to turn the pledge itself into action,” Kerry revealed.

Kerry announced that parties successfully raised funds five times their initial target of $200m even as the $1bn received would be channeled into methane-lowering efforts.

“To help support this country’s efforts, my friends, President Biden launched the methane finance sprint at the April 2023 major economies forum he hosted at the White House. That had the aim of raising $200 million to help us go forward.

“Well, I’m very pleased to announce today that the United States, the European Union, other governments, philanthropies and the private sector significantly exceeded that target.

“And together, we have mobilized over $1bn in new grant funding since COP27 for methane that has more than tripled previous annual methane grant funding,” said Kerry.

He added, “We will leverage the score in project investment. And these funds are going to support cutting methane emissions across all sectors with a focus on low and middle-income countries.”

On his part, the Chinese Envoy said his country was willing to cut down GHG emissions but lacked the full capacity to do so.

Therefore, Zhenhua called for support from the international community."
1143917727,20231202,"Rishi Sunak has been accused of hypocrisy on the international stage after pushing for a phase-out of fossil fuels at the UN Cop28 climate summit in Dubai – weeks after backing more oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.

The prime minister’s lack of “consistency” over climate policy was ridiculed by several senior Conservatives, as well as the former US vice president Al Gore, while members of other international delegations said the UK’s incoherent approach meant it was no longer a global leader on climate issues.

More than 150 world leaders are gathered in Dubai for Cop28 this weekend. One of the most contentious issues is a resolution backing the phasing out of fossil fuels. Proponents say a global commitment to end their use is essential to put the world on track to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

Oil-producing countries stymied attempts to introduce such a commitment at last year’s meeting. But the European Union, along with more than 100 countries, including the US, the UK and many developing nations, are now backing a strong commitment to phase out fossil fuels at this year’s summit. The host country, the United Arab Emirates, a major oil producer, has signalled that the final agreement must address fossil fuels in some way.

But the UK’s support for such a declaration has only highlighted the glaring lack of consistency with its domestic policy. Only last month, Sunak dismayed environmentalists when he announced legislation in the king’s speech for a new annual system of oil and gas licensing in the North Sea. This followed a scaling back of other green commitments including delays to a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers.

Gore, speaking in an interview with the Observer at Cop28 said: “I am not impressed with prime minister Sunak’s climate policies. I think they’re terrible. They’re very disappointing.”

The UK, he said, normally “punched above its weight” in international affairs. “When its policies are supporting the flourishing of humanity and solving the climate crisis, it can have a very big impact for the good. When it is backsliding, it tends to sometimes give permission to other nations to backslide more than they might otherwise do,” he said.

“It does hurt the efforts here at Cop28 to have a UK prime minister adopting policies that can seem to only benefit the fossil fuel industry.”

International leaders noted that Sunak spent less time at this Cop meeting than the opposition leader, Keir Starmer. Several senior Tories also expressed disquiet. Lord Deben, a former cabinet minister who chaired the climate change committee for many years, said: “It’s clearly not credible to ask others to phase out fossil fuels when the UK has given permission for a new coalmine – from which 85% of the production will be exported – and intends to max out production of oil from the North Sea.

“The oil decision means that the UK no longer leads the world on climate; it undermines confidence in our commitment to net zero, and it makes it much harder to get the foreign investment we need. The decision to grant oil licences is economic nonsense.”

Lord Goldsmith, a former environment minister, told the Observer: “The PM’s approach to the environment is an incoherent mess. The UK has gone from being a world leader to being seen by our friends and allies as an unreliable nuisance.”

A senior ally of Boris Johnson remarked that “making progress on this hugely important agenda is all about consistency. It is of critical importance that the UK remains a world leader in this effort.”

Sir Alok Sharma, a former Cop president and ex-cabinet minister, said he welcomed the UK’s international move but added: “Now it is important to have domestic policies which are consistent with our international stance.”

Representatives of several countries also told the Observer they were disappointed at the UK’s stance. Teresa Ribera, Spain’s environment minister, said it was “good to see the leaders of each country stating and reassuring and investing his or her own political capital and making things easier”. Asked whether she thought Sunak had done this, she said: “I don’t.”

At Cop28, Sunak insisted that the UK was “leading the charge”. “We’re absolutely committed to our net zero targets,” he told reporters. “We’ve already decarbonised faster than any other major economy. Our emissions are down 48% since 1990.”

He added: “We’re also one of the largest climate donors, because we want to help those suffering the impacts of climate change.”

Labour sources accompanying Starmer and Ed Miliband found other international delegations bemoaning the UK government’s approach. Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for net zero, said Sunak was taking “double speak” to new levels, “telling other countries to phase out fossil fuels” while “seeking to extract every last drop at home”.

Jamie Peters, head of climate at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the world watching at Cop28, these contradictory messages are further undermining business confidence and the UK’s international climate credibility.”

Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, which campaigns against the use of fossil fuels, said: “This confirms that Rishi Sunak understands the desperate need to phase out fossil fuels to address the climate crisis, but that he lacks the courage to stand up to the oil and gas industry at home.

“The biggest capitulation came in September when he gave in to the Norwegian oil giant Equinor and sanctioned the enormous Rosebank oil field off the Shetland coast, not just adding fuel to the climate fire but subsidising the project, which is mainly oil for export, to the tune of billions. The UK government can no longer have it both ways.”"

Separately, organizers said more than 100 countries have signed onto a pledge to triple the world’s installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, something pledged in September by leaders of the so-called Group of 20. Their countries emit 80% of all planet-warming gases.

1143950741,20231203,"The military leaders of Burkina Faso and Niger said Saturday they would quit the G5 anti-jihadist force in Africa's Sahel region, the latest blow to the fight against insurgents in one of the world's most troubled zones.

The G5, created in 2014, has secured only meagre results, with Mali also quitting the original five-nation force last year in the wake of a military coup.

Leaders of the five countries agreed to deploy a joint anti-terror task force backed by France in 2017, but the military rulers of Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali have all accused Paris of having an outsize role after years of French deployments on their territories.

Burkina and Niger ""have decided in full sovereignty to quit all instances of the G5 Sahel, including the joint force"" as of November 29, the two countries said in a statement.

""The organisation is failing to achieve its objectives. Worse, the legitimate ambitions of our countries, of making the G5 Sahel a zone of security and development, are hindered by institutional red tape from a previous era, which convinces us that our process of independence and dignity is not compatible with G5 participation in its current form,"" they said.

In a veiled reference to France, they added that ""the G5 Sahel cannot serve foreign interests to the detriments of our people, and even less the dictates of any power in the name of a partnership that treats them like children, denying the sovereignty of our peoples.""

Military leaders headed by Captain Ibrahim Traore seized power in Burkina Faso in September 2022, vowing to improve security after years of jihadist attacks by groups affiliated to Al-Qaeda and Islamic State.

Relations with France quickly broke down, with Traore's government ordering French forces that had been helping the under-equipped Burkinabe army to quit the country in February.

More than 17,000 people have died in attacks since 2015 in Burkina Faso, according to a count by an NGO monitor called the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), and two million people have been uprooted by the violence.

On Saturday, Burkina Faso suspended ""all distribution methods"" of Le Monde daily after the French newspaper published an article on a deadly jihadist attack in the north.

The Burkinabe authorities in recent months have suspended the French TV outlets LCI and France24 as well as Radio France Internationale and the magazine Jeune Afrique.

France has also begun withdrawing its 1,500 troops from Niger following demands by the military rulers who ousted President Mohamed Bazoum in July.

Niger's foreign minister Bakary Yaou Sangare on Saturday said the new US ambassador, Kathleen FitzGibbon, who arrived in August, would soon present her letter of assignment to authorities to take up her post.

Washington, which withdrew non-essential staff from its embassy in August, indicated at the time that FitzGibbon would not present her credentials to Niger's new authorities, as the United States did not recognise them.

The West African nation is battling two jihadist insurgencies -- a spillover in its southeast from a long-running conflict in neighbouring Nigeria, and an offensive in the west by militants crossing from Mali and Burkina Faso.

Along with Mali, which saw a military coup in 2020, Burkina has backed Niger's military, with the three nations on Friday supporting the creation of an Alliance of Sahel States, setting up closer economic ties and mutual defence assistance.

The military regimes have also formed close ties against international pressure for a swift return to civilian rule, and to combat the long-running jihadist insurgencies raging in the three countries.

Only Chad and Mauritania now remain in the G5, whose military deployment is largely financed by the European Union.

The French deployment in the region goes back over a decade to 2013, when then president Francois Hollande sent troops into Mali to help fight a jihadist insurgency.

But the military successes have contrasted with political failure, as democracy regressed rather than developed in a region also plagued by a flood of disinformation that Paris blames on Russia.

France also began pulling its troops from Mali last year, ending what became known as the Barkhane mission.

On the ground, few joint G5 operations have actually been carried out and the security situation has continued to deteriorate.

In late November, at least 40 civilians were killed by a major jihadist attack against a military base at Djibo in northern Burkina Faso, according to the United Nations."

The Programme’s Managing Authority is the Dipartimento della Programmazione of Regione Siciliana which, together with the Funds and Programmes Division within the Ministry for the Economy, European Funds and Lands, is responsible for the programme’s sound management in the Maltese and Italian territories.

The Programme had been allocated a budget of €51,708,438, with 85% of the resources provided by European Union’s co-funding through the European Regional Development Fund and 15% by the national contribution of each member State. The sector that received the most resources within the planning context was the Environment Risk Prevention and Management sector, with 28% of the budget; this was followed by the Environment Protection sector (27% of resources), Competitiveness and Employment (23%), ending with Research and Innovation (22%).

Cooperation between the two territories contributed to the objectives of the European Cohesion Policy by promoting the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of the cross-border area and improving the competitiveness of the two territories, reducing discrepancies and disparities and acting on behalf of more fragile people. There were 158 beneficiaries for the 2014/2020 planning cycle of the Programme in the following categories: Public Administrations, Universities and Research Institutions, Clusters and Districts, micro enterprises and SMEs, Chambers of Commerce, Higher Technical Institutes and protected areas Management Authorities. The Programme involved the entire Maltese territory, with Malta, Gozo and Comino, and all the Provinces of Sicily: Trapani, Palermo, Messina, Agrigento, Caltanissetta, Enna, Catania, Ragusa and Syracuse.

With eight funded projects (Itama, Itama Cap, Mediwarn, Natiflife, Bythos, Bythos Extend, MicroWatts and I-Access), the programme supported Research and Innovation in key sectors that are more challenging for territorial growth and development: environment, cultural heritage, quality of life and health of citizens.

Competitiveness of micro enterprises and SMEs and support for Employment and Occupational Mobility were the focus of the programme’s actions, with 6 projects funded in this area (Enisie, I Know, Job Match 2020, Men, Move On and Crosswork), which encouraged social innovation practices, supported the creation/enhancement of enterprises working in the sectors of sustainable tourism, protection of the environment and quality of life, also contributing to the integration of the cross-border labour market and the circulation of human capital.

Protection of the Environment and sustainable development were the common thread of the 2014-2020 planning cycle, and with respect to these the programme funded 11 projects (Simaseed, Simaseed Plus, Harmony, Fast, Bioblu, Senhar, Capsenhar, Corallo, Corallo +Si, Amppa and Seamarvel) supporting initiatives for the protection of the Natura 2000 network sites, the conservation/restoration of natural habitats and of threatened or rare species and promoting environmental awareness campaigns for the responsible use of natural heritage.

Protection of the environment was also supported through Risk Prevention and Management actions for natural risks and/or risks deriving from human activities, the main cause of the abnormal Climate Change with respect to which the programme has acted through initiatives for prevention of the causes and mitigation of negative effects by funding 8 projects: Calypso South, Beyond Calypso, News, Simit Tharsy, BESS, I-Wavenet, GIFLUID and REMACO.

“In bringing to a successful conclusion the 2014-2020 Italy-Malta programme - stated Anthony Camilleri, General Director of the Funds and Programmes Division - Malta intends to continue its participation in the 2021/2027 INTERREG VI-A Italy-Malta programme, with the aim of replicating the positive results achieved and improving cross-border capabilities, in addition to strengthening the strong cooperation and collaboration in place between the two islands”.

The Programme has a budget of €57,604,032 for the 2021/2027 period and is co-funded for 80% by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund. The programme focuses on four priority areas: Research, innovation and skills for competitiveness (30% of resources), Climate change, protection of the environment and circular economy (45% of resources), Culture and sustainable tourism for economic development and social inclusion (10% of resources) and Cross-border area governance (15% of resources).

The first area, Research, innovation and skills for competitiveness, supports projects promoting collaborative research between enterprises and research centres, the provision of services for the creation of new enterprises, support for innovation and mobility of human capital. Targets for projects in this area will be authorities and institutions, public agencies, universities and research centres, enterprises and schools.

The second area, Climate change, protection of the environment and circular economy, encourages interventions to promote adaptation to climate change, the prevention of disasters and the resilience of the cross-border area, also promoting transition to a circular economy. The programme also focuses on conservation of Mediterranean biodiversity, strengthening green infrastructures and reducing pollution. Targets for projects in this area will be authorities and institutions, public agencies, universities and research centres, enterprises, schools, reserves managing entities, parks and protected areas, civil society organisations, associations, Chambers of Commerce.

The Culture and Sustainable tourism area promotes projects for economic development and social inclusion through the regeneration of spaces and cultural places and cultural and creative initiatives. Targets for projects in this area will be authorities and institutions, public agencies, universities and research centres, enterprises, schools, associations active in environmental sectors and in the enhancement of the natural and cultural heritage, entities and associations for the promotion of the active participation of disadvantaged subjects.

Lastly, in the Governance sector, the programme aim is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of cooperation in the cross-border area by supporting initiatives exchanges for the improvement of public authorities’ ability to define integrated cross-border strategies, identify and respond to crises and emergencies and ensure synergy with other programmes. In this case, subjects involved will be political decision-makers, public administrations, education and training organisations, associations and enterprises.

During the event that took place on 14 November in Malta, the representatives of the Funds and Programmes Division and the Managing Authority illustrated the Programme’s operative mechanism and the characteristics of the projects that will be funded. “We are getting ready to publish the first call for cooperation projects - stated, Hon. Chris Bonett, Parliamentary Secretary for European Funds within the Ministry for the Economy, European Funds and Lands- for which a budget of €27,669,483 has been provided by the European Regional Development Fund, corresponding to 65% of the Programme’s financial budget”.

In his intervention, the Parliamentary Secretary also restated that the collaborative spirit and the mutual trust earned in almost 20 years of work will further consolidate in future years from a point of view of strengthening territorial cohesion in the Mediterranean.

The landmark deal was forged on the first day of the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), setting a positive start to the global climate talks, the DENR said in a statement.

Loss and Damage Fund is one of 7 major streams being worked out by the country’s 151-member delegation led by Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga.

The Philippines one with developing nations is pushing for the creation of a loss and damage fund to respond to the adverse impacts of climate change.

While carbon emission of developing countries is minuscule versus global levels, it is disproportionately affected by extreme weather events.

“The Philippines calls for the immediate operationalization of this Fund to assist developing and vulnerable countries to respond to droughts, floods, and rising sea levels exacerbated by climate change,” President Marcos said in his message delivered by Special Assistant to President Antonio Lagdameo Jr.

“We urge our partners from the private sector, civil society, partner countries and governments, and development funding institutions to support the Philippines in this bid,” Marcos added.

“You have been there for meaningful collaboration with our government to tackle the climate crisis.”

“Operationalizing the loss and damage fund is important for us, and this was a hard-fought outcome that would enable us to catalyze assistance for the irreversible impacts of climate change such as extreme weather conditions and slow-onset events which are beyond our ability to finance,” said Yulo-Loyzaga, who also stood as the official representative of the President to the Climate Change Commission while concurrently serving as the head of the Philippine Delegation to COP28.

In an earlier interview, Loyzaga noted that while the Fund is a milestone for global climate action, it is important to ensure that the loss and damage fund is accessible, and can be tailored to specific needs of each country. “It is a very encouraging sign that developed countries are beginning to recognize common but differentiated responsibility and respective capacity. And we want to be at the forefront of that. The President has announced that the Philippines will pursue the hosting of the Loss and Damage Fund Board and we hope to be able to also have a seat on that Board.”

Following the adoption of the agreement to operationalize the fund, several countries pledged over USD270 million for its start-up phase. The fund is designed to receive contributions from a wide variety of sources, with the World Bank initially hosting it, subject to review after four years.

Earlier, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber said the United Arab Emirates would commit USD100 million to the fund; Germany pledged USD100 million; the United Kingdom, USD50.5 million; Japan, USD10 million; the United States, USD17.5 million; and the European Union pledged USD225 million, which includes Germany’s contribution.

Loyzaga earlier said that what is also important is the loss and damage fund may be broadly based. “So not just the developed countries, there may be opportunities for the International Financial Organizations. There may be opportunities for private sector philanthropies to also contribute to this fund. All of this is part of what will be negotiated now in this COP.”

“We are open to broadening the sources and that’s where the use of private sector funding, the use of innovative financing from the different international financial organizations is the most important as well,” Loyzaga said.

Article 8.1 of the Paris Agreement states “Parties recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, and the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of loss and damage.”

COP28 will run from November 30 to December 12, 2023, at the Dubai Expo City."

The dreamed-of transition to a fully electric future within the next 10 years has sparked a worldwide race to mine and refine this new white gold to fuel the transport of tomorrow.

Home to more than 65 percent of the world’s known reserves, could Latin America’s “Lithium Triangle” formed by Argentina, Bolivia and Chile become

the Saudi Arabia of the 21st century?

Lithium (Li) is a chemical element that at its purest takes the form of a soft silver metal. Present in more than 145 types of mineral ores, it is never found in its native metal form. Instead, it can be extracted from hard rock, as in Australia, or recovered by solar evaporation in large saltwater brine basins, as in the South American Andes – the simplest and cheapest method. In 2020, the EU declared lithium a “critical raw material” along with cobalt and nickel, which are also used to make the batteries needed for the energy transition.

Lithium-ion batteries are based on a flow of lithium ions between a positive electrode containing cobalt or manganese and a negative graphite electrode. Developed in the 1970s, lithium batteries have since become the most efficient means of storing electricity. The technology has been widely adopted by the automotive industry over the past decade, and the need for lithium will likely multiply by a factor of 18 by 2030, and a factor of 60 by 2050.

How much lithium is there in an electric car?

Electric car batteries can weigh up to 400 kilograms and contain at least 10 kg of pure lithium. A Tesla contains 80kg of lithium, an electric bike 300 grams and a bus as much as 200kg.

How many electric cars are there in Europe?

One in five cars sold in the European Union in August 2023 were 100 percent electric, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). Factoring in hybrid models, sales of electric cars have reached almost 50 percent of new vehicles sold since the start of 2023. But according to Eurostat, at the end of 2022, they still accounted for just 0.8 percent of the total number of vehicles currently in circulation in Europe. The ban on combustion engines in the EU is set to take effect in 2035.

When will the ban on the sale of combustion engines take effect?

US:

2030: Half of all cars sold in the US have to be “zero-emissions” vehicles.

2035: Ban on the sale of combustion engines in California and New York State (with the exception of plug-in hybrids).

Asia:

By 2025: China is aiming for 20 percent of vehicles to be powered by “new energies” (electric, hybrid or fuel cell), which are set to become the “mainstream” by 2035, according to a document published by Beijing at the end of 2020.

2030: India has set itself the objective of 30 percent electric vehicle sales.

2035: Japan plans to ban the sale of combustion engine-powered vehicles, with the exception of hybrid cars.

How much does lithium cost?

The price for a tonne of lithium was about $6000 in 2020 and reached a peak of $88,000 at the end of 2022. It is currently trading at around $27,500. The value of lithium represents just 1 to 2 percent of the final price of an electric vehicle battery.

From lithium to electric batteries: A new geopolitics of energy?

European governments and manufacturers have been slow to realize the consequences of banning the sale of combustion engines on the continent as of 2035. Carmakers need to secure access as soon as possible to the raw materials needed to make lithium-ion batteries and take ownership of the other stages of their production. Dependent on imports and a production chain largely dominated by China, the Europeans are racing against the clock to carve out a place for themselves in the new world of lithium-powered electric transport.

The European automotive industry imports 100 percent of its lithium needs. The main producers are currently Australia, Chile, China and Argentina.

Where are the main known lithium deposits?

At least 60 percent of the world’s available lithium resources are found in South America’s ABC triangle (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile), according to the US Geological Survey. More precisely, they are found in the salt flats of the Andean highlands – such as the Uyuni salt flats in Bolivia or the Atacama Desert in Chile.

What are the main steps for processing lithium for electric batteries?

In saltworks, lithium extraction involves boring a well to pump salt-rich water into large, shallow basins, where it is evaporated by the sun. It takes between 18 and 24 months to produce a brine rich in lithium chloride. Around 2 million liters of water evaporate for every tonne of lithium produced.

Several chemical processes are then used to obtain lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which is bought by electric battery manufacturers. Five major corporations dominate this market: Albemarle (US), Ganfeng Lithium (China), SQM (Chile), Tianqi (China) and Livent (US).

Battery manufacturing and assembly



After making anodes, cathodes and separators, manufacturers produce lithium-ion cells that are integrated into a shock-resistant battery equipped with a heating and cooling system and electronic control unit.



This is where the famous giga factories come in, massive assembly plants whose vast output is measured in gigawatt hours. The term was introduced by US automotive multinational Tesla in 2013 to describe the first giga factory producing batteries for its electric cars. In years to come, these giga factories could also recycle used batteries and integrate the assembly lines of the electric cars themselves.



Right now, Chinese businesses account for around 70 percent of the electric vehicle battery market, followed by Korean and Japanese manufacturers. Fully one-third of the world’s electric vehicle batteries come from the Chinese corporation CATL alone.

China is today leading every step in the electric vehicle production chain. Although its corporations only account for 14 percent of the actual lithium mining, they are responsible for 89 percent of its refining. With 75 percent of the world’s lithium-ion cell manufacturing and 70 percent of its battery production plants, China is also the leading producer of electric vehicles, responsible for 43 percent of global production.

Faced with the challenge of transitioning to widespread electric car use over the next decade, the EU has invested massive public support in catching up with China in battery production. This policy has been both risky and ineffective, according to a report by the European Court of Auditors released in mid-June 2023.

The EU is also trying to secure its access to lithium, as demonstrated by the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Argentina on June 14 on essential raw materials, including lithium.

Some 40 giga factories are either planned or already up and running in the EU, including four in France, to keep up with competition from China and the US. The stakes are high: independence and sovereignty.

Since the Spanish conquistadors first set foot in South America in the 16th century, extractivism has brought little happiness to Latin Americans. Instead, the continent’s mineral wealth has often been synonymous with vast fortunes for the privileged few and abject poverty for the many.

With its immense lithium deposits – 65 percent of the known global reserves are found in a triangle formed by Argentina, Bolivia and Chile – South America is determined not to let the revenues from this indispensable metal slip away. Across the continent, governments dream of mastering the exploitation of this new white gold that will power the vehicles of tomorrow.

Martin Obaya, a lithium specialist and an economist at Conicet, Argentina’s National Scientific and Technical Research Council, spoke with FRANCE 24 about the lofty ambitions and stubborn realities of the three countries that make up the “Lithium Triangle”.

FRANCE 24: With its lithium reserves, could Latin America become the Saudi Arabia of the 21st century?



Martin Obaya: The short answer to that question would be no. It’s true that the majority of the world’s lithium resources are found in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. But we mustn’t lose sight of the fact that the extractive industries are very dynamic and that as prices and needs increase, new deposits will very likely be found in other parts of the world.



New deposits are being discovered – in the US as well as in Europe – that are often non-traditional, like for example Germany’s geothermal deposits. This is because lithium is a very geologically abundant resource on Earth.

Lithium is a very geologically abundant resource on Earth

Certain kinds of deposits are not economically viable with the technology that we have at our disposal today. But as new technologies are developed and the price of lithium remains relatively high, new sources of lithium supplies are likely to emerge.



We should also note that of these three countries, Bolivia alone accounts for around 22 percent of the world’s lithium resources. But Bolivia has run into difficulties because its saltworks are very rich in magnesium.

FRANCE 24: How is the lithium industry developing in Argentina, Chile and Bolivia?



Martin Obaya: The three countries have adopted very different development models. The triangle metaphor hides importance differences.

Three lithium-mining models in South America



Argentina: Huge potential for expansion through the private sector, with little state involvement.



Bolivia: Highly state-controlled mining operations, making the development of industrial-scale businesses very difficult. 



Chile : Guidelines set by the state. The country with the most experience, and the most production.

In Argentina, lithium is mined within the general regulatory framework for mining operations, which is very liberal and which was adopted in the 1990s. That means that lithium projects can be freely leased to the private sector. Furthermore, Argentina is the only country in the region with a federal system, which means that lithium mining is administered by the provinces. Each province grants concessions and sets environmental controls. There are currently more than 30 projects in development across the country.

In 2008, Bolivia adopted a strategy of strong state control, which gives the state the monopoly on saltworks operations with the state-owned company YLB (Yacimientos del litio boliviano), which was created in 2017. In 2010, its strategy was to create pilot plants, an industrial plant capable of producing 15,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate and a battery production plant. So far, it has only been able to build the pilot plants. This year, Bolivia launched a new partnership strategy with Chinese and Russian consortia to develop a direct extraction method – something that is still experimental.

Chile has had a very dynamic system somewhere between the two since the 1990s. In Chile, the state owns the deposits. They can’t be leased to private companies. But the state has signed contracts that have allowed private extraction in exchange for royalties. In 2023, the government announced a new national lithium strategy as well as the creation of a public company. It’s very likely that the state will try to renegotiate with SQM (Editor’s note: Sociedad Química y Minera, a private Chilean lithium mining company and a major player in the sector) by becoming a partner. This strategy also leaves open the possibility for the Chilean state to exploit other saltworks through this new company.

FRANCE 24: What do Chile and Argentina export? The raw material or a product that has already been processed?



Martin Obaya: People often talk about the need for our countries to stop exporting raw materials. In the case of lithium, though, there is a distinction to be made between the extraction of lithium from rocks and that which is made through evaporation in saltworks.

Australia, the world’s leading lithium producer, practices rock-based extraction. They export a rock that has undergone very little chemical treatment, resulting in a product that contains six percent lithium. Almost 100 percent of this is exported to China. In Argentina and Chile, lithium is exported directly in the form of lithium carbonate and, in the case of Chile, there is even small-scale production of lithium hydroxide.

Lithium carbonate has a much higher price. Its degree of sophistication is also increasing as the technical specifications set by the automotive companies and the battery cell manufacturers become more and more precise. The product therefore has a much higher export price than that which is exported by Australia.

FRANCE 24: Having traditionally been exporters of raw materials, Latin American countries want to use lithium to become exporters of high value-added products. Is this ambition achievable?

I think that what’s becoming very clear now is that it’s hard to produce batteries in Latin America. The global market for batteries is growing, and this production goes hand in hand with the development of an electromobility industry. It’s complicated enough to produce batteries. Even Europe has struggled to develop production plants.

Our politicians think that since we’re producing lithium, we can make batteries. This idea is a little simplistic, as the development of batteries needs to be very close to the major (automotive) markets and we have to remember that lithium represents less than 10 percent of the production cost of a battery.

FRANCE 24: With their lithium reserves, can Latin American countries build a new relationship with China?

China occupies a dominant position in every part of the chain. Many lithium deposits are controlled by Chinese companies. But China’s presence extends equally to other types of natural resources.

From a political point of view, the negotiating capacity of the Argentine government, which is also financially dependent on the Chinese government, is reduced. Argentina has tried to stay equidistant from the US and China in terms of natural resources, but China is the main buyer of its raw materials and agricultural products.

The Bolivian government has chosen China as a partner to develop new direct-extraction technologies, because it believes that China is more in line with its geopolitical interests.

China’s domination of access to natural resources is pretty worrying

I think that China’s domination of access to natural resources is pretty worrying. And above all, to be honest, it seems to me that Europe is not in a favourable position.

Europe has been weakened by the difficulties that it has faced in establishing stable and secure supply lines for raw materials over time. One of the main concerns of European automotive manufacturers is how to secure the raw materials to be able to make batteries and not to buy them from China. But they’re far behind schedule.

European carmakers are far behind schedule in securing their access to raw materials"
1144057331,20231203,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The U.N. climate summit kicked off Thursday with a parade of wealthy nations offering big-money pledges to help poorer countries cope with the ravages of a warming world — a surprise that turns up the pressure on countries like China to open their checkbooks.

Leading the charge was the summit’s oil-rich host, the United Arab Emirates, whose $100 million (€92 million) vow seemed designed to defuse months of criticism about whether it can serve as an honest broker in talks about ending the world’s fossil fuel dependence. Its offer matched one from Germany.

The maneuver certainly turned heads — and kicked off a cascade of contributions, making for a remarkable opening day at the 28th annual COP conference. The European Union said it would give at least €225 million for the fund (including Germany’s pledge). The United Kingdom tossed in £40 million, or approximately €46 million.

Trailing far behind: the United States, at $17.5 million, or roughly €16 million.

Suddenly, it was the UAE getting the praise. EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra thanked the country for “leading the way for new donors.”

He added: “Thanks to the EU’s efforts, the fund is open to contributions from all parties that have the capacity to pay.”

His comment was a clear nod to the fact that the pledge transcended a decades-old divide in climate talks between “developed” and “developing” nations, particularly on financial matters. Many activists and climate-vulnerable countries have long argued that rich, industrialized countries responsible for the bulk of planet-warming emissions should take the lead on funding climate action. Even the Paris Agreement echoes this point.

Now, however, the spotlight will turn to countries like China, the world’s second-largest economy, and Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two small yet affluent countries. All three are still considered “developing countries” under the U.N. climate framework despite amassing considerable wealth in recent generations.

“We are building bridges between traditional donor countries and new, non-traditional donors,” said German Development Minister Svenja Schulze, who announced Berlin’s $100 million contribution via video link in the plenary, in a statement.

Without mentioning any country in particular, she added: “After all, many countries that were still developing countries 30 years ago can now afford shouldering their share of responsibility for global climate-related loss and damage.”

An age-old battleMost developing countries want to maintain their existing categorization, which harkens back to an early rubric used to define which countries are rich and poor.

But developed countries like the U.S. and those in Europe are campaigning for high-polluting emerging economies to contribute funding, a push aimed at broadening the donor base as financial needs grow.

The countries’ commitments will go into what’s known as a “loss and damage” fund in U.N. jargon. The money is intended to help compensate for the destruction wrought by extreme weather and other consequences of global warming.

Delegates from nearly 200 countries signed off on the initiative only hours into the summit, a positive sign given the issue was mired in fractious talks in the weeks before COP.

The U.S. pledge, small as it was, was still notable given that Washington has historically been reluctant to offer specific dollar amounts for the new fund. In recent weeks Biden administration officials have indicated their support for the fund but said they wanted to see it finalized before considering donations.

That said, even the $17.5 million may never come to fruition, as the White House could need sign-off from a Republican-controlled House that has been hostile to such efforts and is already stymied on other international aid decisions.

Still, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry was bullish on Thursday.

“We also expect the fund to be up and running quickly,” he said. “We expect that will help address priority gaps in the current landscape of support, and we expect it will draw from a wide variety of sources.”

In the absence of direct bilateral aid, the U.S. is working to draw in more money from the private sector and has supported the idea of funding from more innovative sources, which could include things like levies on air travel.

Behind the U.S. was Japan, which said it would give $10 million.

“While the overall signal from today’s pledges is positive, it is disappointing that the United States and Japan chipped in so little,” said Ani Dasgupta, president of the World Resources Institute. “Given the size of their economies, there is simply no excuse for their contributions to be far eclipsed by others.”

Dasgupta called the UAE pledge “particularly notable,” since it broadens the group of nations providing climate finance.

Making historyThe deluge of announcements came after delegates approved the framework for the new climate disaster fund, a landmark decision that prompted a standing ovation at the summit.

“We have delivered history today,” COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber — who also heads the UAE’s state-owned oil company — told delegates, adding that this marks “the first time a decision has been adopted on Day One at any COP.”

Delegations and civil society organizations broadly welcomed Thursday’s announcements and U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said the development gave the conference “a running start.”

But some warned of a yawning gap between the initial pledges and countries’ financing needs.

“The initial funding pledges are clearly inadequate and will be a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of the need they are to address,” said Mohamed Adow, director of the nonprofit Power Shift Africa.

“In particular, the amount announced by the U.S. is embarrassing for President Biden and John Kerry,” he added. “It just shows how this must be just the start.”

As for China, “I don’t think they will pledge,” said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “But this highlights the urgency for China to consider its evolving responsibilities when it comes to finance.”

Still, the $200 million from Germany and the UAE will cover the cost of getting the fund set up under the World Bank, allowing additional pledges to flow into the fund itself.

“This day is doubly auspicious due to the immediate commencement of the capitalization process,” said Pa’olelei Luteru, a Samoan diplomat who chairs an alliance of island nations long pushing for the fund.

“This is an encouraging beginning,” he added, “but there is much work ahead of us.”"

1144077013,20231204,"An article on the World Socialist Web Site exposing the slavish support of the Workers’ Cause Party (PCO) for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s reactionary capitalist government in Turkey has provoked an angry reaction from that pseudo-left Brazilian organization.

Unable to dispute the principled exposure published by the WSWS, the PCO wrote a contemptible statement aimed at slandering the Socialist Equality Group (GSI) in Brazil and the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI), which it accused of being a “pro-imperialist gringo group.”

This reactionary petty-bourgeois nationalist attack was extended into a personal slander of the author of the WSWS article, Eduardo Parati, a leader of the GSI and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) in Brazil. The PCO stated that Parati, “despite being Brazilian, demonstrates that he has the mentality of a North American and, with that, a total lack of understanding of what politics is in a country like Brazil and in backward countries in general.”

The PCO’s attacks are aimed against the building of the Trotskyist movement in Brazil. They are designed to pollute the political environment with a chauvinist hysteria that identifies internationalist socialists as “external agents” and legitimizes the persecution of the GSI and its members. This threat is especially serious given that the PCO is openly oriented towards unity of action with fascist organizations on the basis of their common nationalist program.

The PCO’s virulent response underscores the correctness of the WSWS’s characterization of this organization as a petty-bourgeois nationalist tendency categorically hostile to the working class and socialism.

The ICFI defends the political independence of the working class in Turkey and Brazil

The PCO accuses the WSWS of falsifying the group’s attitude towards the Erdoğan government. As explained by Parati: “[It is] in their choice of international allies that organizations like the PCO demonstrate their reactionary character. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s recent [electoral] victory was enthusiastically celebrated by the PCO, which tried to present him as an anti-imperialist leader.” Quoting this excerpt from the WSWS article, the PCO writes:

And further on:

How did the WSWS falsify the PCO’s positions on Turkey’s elections? It merely cited the PCO’s own statements.

On May 28, shortly after Erdoğan’s re-election was announced, the PCO declared on its official Twitter account:

The circulation achieved by this tweet was celebrated in a May 31 article on the party’s Causa Operária website, entitled, “PCO goes viral on social media by defending anti-imperialist position.” It gloated in the tweet having been viewed by “more than 290,000 people,” and its receiving comments of praise from Erdoğan’s supporters in Turkey. The tweet likewise received laudatory coverage by Anadolu Ajansı, Turkey’s state-run news agency.

PCO readers would have serious difficulties concluding from these lines that “bourgeois nationalism is incapable of defeating imperialism” and that the “only social class capable of doing so is the world working class,” since they advocate just the opposite.

Its regurgitation of formal Marxist phrases notwithstanding, the real goals of the PCO’s intervention are unequivocal: to subordinate the Turkish and Brazilian working classes to the ruling classes of their respective countries, to dissolve the specific class interests of the workers into the “general interests of the nation” and to amalgamate mass opposition to imperialism with the defense of the bourgeois national state.

That intervention acquired a particularly sinister character because it was fraudulently presented to the Turkish public as the position of “Brazilian Trotskyists.” This fact alarmed the Sosyalist Eşitlik Grubu (Socialist Equality Group, SEG), the Turkish section of the ICFI, which saw Trotskyism being falsely identified with support for Erdoğan.

As the legitimate representative of the international Trotskyist movement, the SEG was the only organization during the presidential elections in Turkey to wage a campaign for the political independence of the working class.

In its manifesto on the elections, the SEG strongly rejected “the claim that the masses of workers and youth have to choose between the two right-wing bourgeois alliances,” explaining: “The fight against imperialist war, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the cost of living and social inequality and authoritarian forms of rule requires the international revolutionary mobilization of the working class against capitalism on the basis of a socialist program and the taking of power.”

The WSWS article exposing the PCO is an example of the internationalist practice and political orientation of the Trotskyist movement. The decision to write that article was the product of discussion between the Socialist Equality Groups in Brazil and Turkey, initiated by a warning from the SEG to its Brazilian comrades.

On May 29, a comrade from the SEG wrote to us: “That tweet had some influence here. A lot of replies came from Turkey, basically saying: ‘Brazilian Trotskyists support Erdoğan’. So if genuine Trotskyists in Brazil expose these reactionaries, I think it would be important for Turkey, Brazil and internationally.”

This form of political work is absolutely alien to a petty-bourgeois nationalist organization like the PCO. Their international relations are on the level of bourgeois state diplomacy: once the bourgeois elections are over, the PCO salutes the “Turkish workers” for their results, and, in return, receives “messages of appreciation from Erdoğan’s supporters.”

Stung by the WSWS’s exposure of its bankrupt program based on subordination to the national bourgeoisie, the PCO seeks to justify itself through a grotesque falsification of Trotsky on the anti-imperialist struggle in the oppressed countries.

After stating that it never claimed that Erdoğan “acts on the basis of a supposed interest in defending the population who are victims of imperialism’s wars,” the PCO continues:

In other words, regardless of their will, the Turkish bourgeoisie and that of other semi-colonial countries are driven to confront imperialism and secure their national interests. According to the PCO, by contradicting this basic principle, “the WSWS writer, despite claiming to be a Trotskyist, takes a totally anti-Trotskyist position.” Justifying this accusation, the PCO writes:

This section is emblematic of the PCO’s political charlatanism. In a totally artificial manner, it conflates Trotsky’s quote, asserting the necessity to defend an oppressed country against an imperialist one in war, regardless of the character of their respective regimes, with its own petty-bourgeois nationalist maxim: “one should always side with the nationalist government,” including in bourgeois elections.

Seeking to erase Trotsky’s uncompromising defense of the complete political independence of the proletariat, the PCO removes the excerpt of his interview from any historical and political context. The hypothetical scenario of a conflict between Brazil and England was raised by the leader of the Fourth International as he specifically fought to untangle the confusion created by the Stalinist Popular Front policy, which subordinated the international working class to Moscow’s “democratic” imperialist allies.

However, Trotsky’s arguments to support semi-colonial Brazil in a war against imperialist Britain did not imply any political support for the semi-fascist Brazilian government, as the PCO fraudulently seeks to present it. On the contrary, such policy could only be developed in line with the Transitional Program, that defines the Fourth International’s attitude to a war between an imperialist and a colonial country or the USSR in the following way:

Moreover, the conception that the struggle against imperialism leads the working class and its party to the “side of the nationalist government” is, in reality, the complete opposite of the Theory of Permanent Revolution and its programmatic implications.

As he fought Stalin’s catastrophic imposition of the two-stage theory of revolution in China, which subordinated the Chinese Communist Party to the Kuomintang party of the national bourgeoisie, Trotsky wrote in 1927:

The PCO reproduces the entire reactionary essence of the Stalinist program which led to the crushing of China’s revolutionary working class. However, it does it under objective historical conditions that make it even more destructive and politically criminal.

While Stalin’s promotion of the Kuomintang was largely based on the argument (already refuted by the Russian Revolution) that, given the predominantly rural and peasant population of China, the working class was not yet sufficiently mature to fight for political power, the PCO seeks to impose this same reactionary program on contemporary Brazil and Turkey. That is, on countries with the largest urban concentrations in South America and in Europe and West Asia; with massive working classes that operate key sectors of global industry; and where the national bourgeoisies have a long history of counterrevolutionary collaboration with imperialism.

The WSWS article attacked by the PCO particularly emphasized the Erdoğan regime’s collaboration with NATO’s imperialist wars over the last decades. Parati explained that Erdoğan remains “fully capable of promoting imperialist interests” amid the escalating US-NATO war against Russia.

The WSWS has never characterized Turkey as an “imperialist government.” However, the real aim of the PCO’s attack is the Marxist conception, based on the Theory of Permanent Revolution, that the Turkish and Brazilian bourgeoisies are essentially instruments of imperialism. Trotsky left no doubt that this was the character of Getúlio Vargas’ “nationalist government.” In a discussion with members of the Fourth International, also in 1938, he explained: “If the national bourgeoisie is obliged to give up the struggle against the foreign capitalists and to work under the direct tutelage of the foreign capitalists, then we have a semi-fascist regime, as in Brazil for example.”

Having begun by justifying its defense of the Erdoğan government based on its supposed conflict with imperialism, the PCO ends up declaring its support for bourgeois nationalism regardless of the conditions. The Turkish regime’s collaboration with NATO’s imperialist wars and its “bargaining” to submit the country to the imperialist yoke of the European Union are shamelessly supported by the PCO, because Erdoğan “doesn’t stop being a nationalist government because of that”!

At the dead end of nationalism, the pseudo-left embraces fascism

The WSWS precisely identified the global political implications of the PCO’s promotion of Erdoğan’s and other bourgeois nationalist regimes. Parati wrote:

Having celebrated the Russian invasion of Ukraine with an article titled “Here’s to Vladimir Putin!”—in which it declared that “Seeing someone stand up to our enemies is always encouraging. But Putin has gone much further”—the PCO was infuriated by Parati’s sharp exposition.

It answered with a desperate attempt to disqualify the WSWS’s arguments by turning them inside out. They claimed that by characterizing the ongoing war as “imperialist” and its aim as a “redivision of the world” Parati is “demonstrating that his analysis is that China and Russia are ‘imperialist powers.’” This is nothing more than a play on words, the political method of the dishonest and the demoralized petty-bourgeois.

The section distorted by the PCO clearly refers to the NATO imperialist powers and the war they are waging against Russia and preparing against China. Although today they are waging a united offensive under the direction of Washington, the rival imperialist powers gathered in NATO are each stubbornly seeking to secure their own greater share of the spoils of war and to rebuild their military power and global influence. The resurgence of open inter-imperialist conflicts, as in the two previous world wars, is an inevitable outcome and is already developing.

The PCO’s attribution of the theory of “Russian/Chinese imperialism” to the WSWS is a lie that stands in contradiction to the solid political record of the International Committee of the Fourth International. A significant part of the more than 1,000 articles published by the WSWS on the war in Ukraine has been dedicated to debunking the pseudo-left’s justifications for US-NATO imperialist aims, particularly the anti-Marxist theory of “Russian imperialism.”

Raising the “Russian/Chinese imperialism” theory as a political straw-man, the PCO conveniently shrugs off the task of responding to the Parati article’s characterization of their own perspective on the US-NATO war. They evade criticism with rhetorical statements about having already clarified their disagreements with “analysts who claim that we are facing the emergence of a ‘multipolar’ world.” However, this supposed alternative vision to the “multipolar world” theory is never presented in a coherent form.

The PCO’s variant of “multipolarism” came out particularly clearly from the mouth of the long-time national leader of the PCO, Rui Costa Pimenta, in a discussion about “The war in Ukraine and Brazil” promoted by the pro-PT Brasil 247 in March 2022. Pimenta explained the international conflict in the framework of a “collapse of globalization,” pointing to its political consequences:

The perspective laid out by the PCO leader is the absolute opposite of Marxism. The fundamental contradiction of the capitalist system, between the integrated character achieved by global economy and the crippling barriers imposed by the national states, is not to be resolved by the working class carrying out the international socialist revolution. For Pimenta only a major historical retrogression, which passes through the retraction of global economies and the reactionary policies of national capitalist elites against “internationalization,” can prompt the “political recovery of the world working class.”

The most sinister aspect of this ultra-reactionary orientation is expressed in the banality with which the leader of the PCO assumes the confluence of his objectives with those of the extreme right.

The identification made by Pimenta between the supposed “anti-imperialism” defended by his party and fascist “anti-globalism” is a critical point. In our previous article, we charged PCO with seeking to divert opposition to imperialism into the reactionary channels of nationalism. An addendum is necessary: they are seeking to divert it, more specifically, into the arms of fascism.

In the last period, the PCO established a sordid alliance with the New Resistance (NR), Brazilian followers of the Russian fascist ideologue Alexander Dugin. In classic fascist language, the NR declares that its “objective is to erect a New World and a New Homeland, through a New Order, built by a New Man” and “to forge a politically solid project consistent with what Brazil is in its essence: an Empire.”

While promoting “multipolarism” and “anti-globalism,” the New Resistance directs its attacks against the “globalist left” and what they identify as the “anarcho-Trotskyist rabble.” Like the PCO, it worships Getúlio Vargas, calling him the “Brazilian Caesar.” They specifically praise the fact that Vargas “ruled with the Integralists [the Brazilian brown shirts],” “collaborated with Nazi Germany, supported the Nationalist gang in the Spanish Civil War, correctly deported the criminal Olga Benário [the German-Brazilian Communist Party member who was gassed in a Nazi concentration camp].”

In a video widely circulated by the PCO, Pimenta promoted his party’s criminal collaboration with this fascist organization: “Unlike the left who already wants to label them [the NR] as fascists or something like that, we look at them as a group that is trying to define a political position.” This is pure cynicism. The NR has a well-defined ideology, which is precisely what attracts the PCO. “Insofar as they have a nationalist position,” Pimenta continues, “I think we can have a common activity.”

The PCO’s programmatic defense of a political alliance with fascism led it to react rabidly to the ICFI’s exposition of the reactionary Rage Against the War Machine demonstration held in Washington D.C. in February. Convened by demoralized pseudo-lefts and libertarians together with open fascists, it aimed to promote the politically criminal idea that the fascist wing of the US ruling class linked to Donald Trump is against war.

In an article attacking the US Socialist Equality Party’s principled opposition to this deeply reactionary movement, the PCO declared that an anti-war movement in the United States must naturally include Trump supporters, once “Trump is an obstacle to the policy of imperialism.” This spurious position is based on a thorough rejection of the revolutionary character of the American working class, whose interests are objectively united with the workers in the backward countries, and whose role is decisive in the struggle to overthrow imperialism and world capitalism.

Behind the reactionary attacks on the Brazilian Socialist Equality Group as being a “gringo group” with an “American mentality” lies the PCO’s deep hostility to the assertion of the political independence and revolutionary unity of the working class in the US, Brazil and across the world, represented by the International Committee of the Fourth International. This rabid reaction to socialist internationalism is, in turn, the most concrete manifestation of the PCO’s chauvinist alliance with the New Resistance fascists.

The PCO’s embrace of fascism is the deplorable result of a long political trajectory marked by national opportunism. The PCO traces its origins in the opportunist political operations of the Pabloite renegade Pierre Lambert in Latin America after his break with the ICFI and Trotskyism.

The Workers’ Cause (CO) emerged from an unprincipled split with the Brazilian Internationalist Socialist Organization (OSI) linked to Lambert in 1979. Over the following decades, it remained strictly subordinate to the Workers Party (PT) and the union bureaucracy of the Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT), just like its former OSI partners. Even after being expelled from the PT and founding the PCO in 1995, it remained inflexibly oriented towards the PT, the CUT and the Brazilian state.

The political conditions that gave rise to the opportunist national activity of the PCO and other Pabloite organizations are now collapsing under the impact of the capitalist crisis and the advance of global war. The fascist coup plotted by former president Jair Bolsonaro and the military, and the sharp turn to the right by the Workers Party are demonstrations of the inability of the bourgeois state to hide its essence as an instrument of social counter-revolution.

The pseudo-left, with its nationalist programs, find itself at a dead end. Its political development can only give birth to monsters such as the alliance with fascism advanced by the PCO. But the same historical shift that leads to the political degeneration of Pabloism and the entire pseudo-left is producing the conditions for building Trotskyist parties affiliated to the ICFI as the political leadership of the working class in Brazil and internationally."

Trade Minister Don Farrell walked away from the bloc's latest offer after it failed to come to the table with an agreement that would provide Australian farmers with more access to European markets.

Any deal has essentially been put on ice for the next year or two as Europe enters its domestic election cycle, the government has flagged.

""Our trade ministers will ... reprise this negotiation next year if possible,"" Senator Wong told a joint press conference with her French counterpart on Monday.

""We might see how we can pursue the conversation if there is any will on your side as well,"" Ms Colonna told the National Press Club in Canberra before a ministerial meeting.

EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis recently cancelled a trip to Brazil in a setback for the bloc's aim to net a trade agreement with a group of South American nations by the end of this year.

It was untenable to have European farmers making efforts to decarbonise but then being undercut by allowing in products from Brazil that didn't follow such rules, he said.

But the impasse in negotiations between Europe and Australia was mainly related to agriculture, not environmental standards, Ms Colonna said."
1144106807,20231204,"I’m a Chilean-Spanish journalist, and I write to you from Madrid. In 2006, my team and I were one of the first broadcast teams in Chile to get into Guyana to film a documentary about your country, completely unknown for most Chilean people. In that time the bridge between Bonfim, Brazil, and Lethem was still under construction. We got to the Guyanese border by a little boat. We ride after, the 500 kms. to Georgetown in many hours, crossing the beautiful sabana (savannah) and Amerindian villages, under very difficult dirt roads, and we started to discover a new and dazzling land; full of beauty, landscapes and diversity, completely different to all Latin America. Because that’s the (obvious) fact that the tyranny of the dictator Maduro seems to not understand: Guyana is not Latin, is Caribbean, and thank Lord it is.

A proud Guyanese could never be Venezuelan, no matter the citizenship you offer. We all know, of course, the true reasons about your neighbour’s satrap in doing this unacceptable “referendum”. He consumed all Venezuelan oil and resources and needs more. Would be a pity to see how a beautiful nation as Guyana gets consumed into an evil Bolivarian experiment. Everybody knows how it (will) end, whenever it happens. In that order, l prefer to silence also my opinion about the languid attitude of the ICJ in this case. I still can say, with humility, that I’m one of the Chilean journalist who most knows about Guyana, even Surinam and the French Guyana (where I’ve been too).

Three extraordinary but still unknown territories for almost all the southern continent.

I still remember when I was interviewed on Guyanese television for the great businessman Yesu Persaud (RIP), who was very interested in our trip and why, finally, the press of a big country in the region, Chile, was suddenly interested in your tiny land. I shared with him a lot of impressions and I still remember the vehemence, love and conviction in the future of Guyana in Mr. Persaud’s eyes. He was completely right. Guyana is one of my favourite countries in the world (I have been in many) and I can’t wait the moment to come back. This is a battle that the tyrant must not win. You have our support, the support of most countries in South America, the support of the European Union, United States and UK. And many others. Guyana never will be “Latin”. And thank God it is not."
1144108621,20231204,"Demetra Kalogerou was the longest serving Chair at the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission with a reputation for building new markets, but also being tough when integrity was at stake.

Her impressive record in reshaping the financial industry at a time when the banking scandal wreaked havoc with billions in losses, she helped build resilience and prosperity.

She also took a leading part in the independent investigation committee that was set up three years ago following the Al Jazeera investigation of the Cyprus Citizenship by Investment programme which uncovered how massive abuses of the system led to thousands of passports being issued illegally, even to some of the most notorious criminals in the world.

Now as the ‘Cyprus Confidential’ files continue to unfold by exposing the Putin regime’s practices to undermine the West, many have argued that Cyprus’ reputation has taken a new hit. President Christodoulides was particularly alarmed by the new revelations and vowed to take strong action to defend the country’s reputation.

We discussed with Kalogerou these issues and how the country can emerge from this new scandal. Having comprehensive views from experts of such calibre can only help restore trust and confidence in the system. Thankfully she did not minced her words.

What went wrong that resulted in the spectacular failure of the citizenship programme, especially after the government introduced new tougher regulations.

Cyprus’s heavy reliance on the Cyprus Investment Program (CIP) for financial recovery following the banking crisis in 2013 has brought attention to a conflict between economic interest and compliance with broader EU regulations and ethical conduct. Specifically, this conflict arises from the recent anti money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations that were transposed to our national legislation obligating the supervised entities to adhere to them. While the programme has generated significant revenue for our economy, it was perceived as exploiting EU membership for financial gain, potentially jeopardising the integrity of the financial system of the EU.

The OCCRP investigation at the beginning of 2019, followed by the Al Jazeera investigation in August 2020 known as “The Cyprus Papers” revealed that numerous dubious applicants, including individuals with criminal background were granted Cypriot citizenship and subsequently became EU citizens. This led the government and the Attorney General to announce independent investigations into the programme.

These investigations revealed that the CIP had been operating from 2007- 2020 with significant gaps and shortcomings. These deficiencies were attributed to an inadequate legislative framework that allowed questionable individuals to obtain citizenship often in exchange for funds of unknown origin.

In essence, certain service providers, primarily lawyers and accountants, but also other fiduciaries were not playing by the rules of AML and KYC. That’s because the acquisition of citizenship was not a regulated service at the time.

The investigation revealed that in many cases these clients were also provided with administration services that do fall under the AML rules. Therefore, the service providers should have conducted thorough checks on the funds’ origins and performed KYC procedures on the investors before submitting the applications to the Ministry of Interior as the first line of defense.

However, both the Ministries of Interior and Finance as a second line of defense, lacked the necessary tools, systems, personnel and experience to effectively supervise the programme. Instead, they relied heavily on information provided by the service providers, the banks and other government bodies, which proved to be grossly inadequate for conducting comprehensive background checks.

Moreover, it was discovered that the ministries failed to take action even when they possessed disqualifying information about certain investors indicating a lack of due diligence and oversight in the programme. The banks on the other hand, were more focused on their relationships with the local developers and service providers, neglecting to properly monitor clients’ accounts or report suspicious transactions.

Lastly, the final approval of an investor’s citizenship was carried out by the Cabinet, serving as a third line of defense. Unfortunately, this approval process seemed to be almost automatic, without any questioning or any evaluation of potential conflicts of interest. The findings from the investigative committees emphasised the possibility of political, supervisory, administrative, and criminal responsibilities and made several recommendations.

In response to these findings, the government has implemented a series of actions including the establishment of a special committee responsible for revoking passports of investors with criminal records, those wanted by Europol or Interpol, individuals subject to sanctions, or those with tarnished reputation. Up to now the government has revoked a total of 222 passports, which includes 63 investors and 159 of their relatives.

Additionally, authorities like the Unit for Combating Money Laundering, the tax department, and all the competent authorities responsible for the oversight of the legal or otherwise regulated entities have been urged to enhance their supervision and thoroughly investigate all the parties involved, including the service providers/promoters and other parties associated with the scheme, for any potential wrongdoing or violations of AML/CFT laws and sanctions.

Furthermore, the findings of these investigations were submitted to the Attorney General’s office for further examination of possible criminal offenses. The Attorney General has initiated legal action against serious cases of the CIP programme. It is important to note that legal processes, including trials and potential convictions can be time-consuming, especially in complex cases like those associated with this scheme.

The government officially terminated the CIP programme in August 2020 following the Al Jazeera investigation which also led to the resignation of the Speaker of the House and two more members of parliament.

Has the reputation of Cyprus been tarnished and if so, to what extent?

The Al Jazeera investigation significantly tarnished the country’s reputation to a great extent by associating it with financial crime and highlighted a lack of due diligence in granting Cypriot passports, often with political interference. Unfortunately, this exposure led to reputational damage not just for Cyprus, but also for the European Union given that the Cyprus citizenship provided access to the EU.

Moreover, recently another investigation by the international consortium of investigative journalists (ICIJ) called the “Cyprus confidential” revealed how Cyprus has facilitated transactions and services to evade sanctions and channel payments through a limited number of service providers. Again, these revelations have the potential to further damage Cyprus’ global financial reputation, portraying it as a haven for illicit financial activities and sanctions evasion.

Cyprus might also face increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies including the EU potentially leading to stricter financial regulations and closer oversight.

In response to this report, the government announced that financial crime experts will conduct investigations and that any infringements of the law will not be tolerated by anyone stressing the importance of Cyprus’ reputation and credibility.

Is our country really a state that can easily launder money?

Just like in the rest of Europe, there is the appropriate European framework and the necessary mechanism and tools to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Over the last seven years, Cyprus has implemented numerous reforms and remains fully aligned with all the European regulations on AML/CFT while also adhering to policies and recommendations of the financial action task force FATF.

Additionally, all competent authorities have strengthened their supervision and enforcement of their supervised entities

The key findings of the Moneyval Report in February 2020 acknowledged the progress made by Cyprus in implementing an enhanced AML/CFT framework, thereby supporting the international community’s fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. The positive assessment is a vote of confidence that Cyprus is heading in the right direction. However, it is essential to recognise that there is always room for improvement, something that we need to address on an ongoing basis.

So, what should be done to avoid scandals of similar nature in the future and help Cyprus build a good reputation as a sound investment destination bearing in mind that our banking system is still reeling from its own failure a decade ago?

A series of steps should be taken in that direction with government initiative where such action is warranted from past experience and global regulatory developments.
• Continuous improvement of regulatory frameworks is crucial to align with international standards particularly those set by the FATF. Timely transposition of European AML/CFT regulations (6th AML directive) into national legislation as well as a commitment to implement the recommendations provided in Moneyval’s latest assessment report.
• Accelerating investigations and ensuring that their findings can help build strong anti-money laundering cases with good chances of conviction. Delivering harsh verdicts in such cases can clearly serve as the best deterrent.
• Improving transparency in financial transactions and corporate ownership is essential for detecting illicit activities. This includes enforcing the AML laws around beneficial ownership and monitoring high risk sectors more closely.
• Establishing an independent supervisory authority as announced by the government, so that the administrative service providers can further enhance the supervision of this sector. The allocation of adequate resources toward this objective is important to ensure effective oversight and enforcement. In 2019/2020 while I was still Chair at CySEC, I submitted to the previous government a proposal for the creation of such an independent authority. I also suggested that CySEC could undertake this role if given the power to monitor the fiduciary industry in terms of AML. Had this proposal being adopted we could have prevented a great deal of damage and defended the credibility and trust of the system.
• Engaging in greater international cooperation and information sharing can aid in the fight against cross-border financial crimes.
• Continuously assessing the effectiveness of measures in place and being willing to adopt to new threats and changes in the global financial landscape.
• Most importantly, promoting a culture of ethics and integrity within the financial sector and among public officials can help prevent corruption and financial crimes.
• Finally, implementing an effective communication strategy is crucial to improve Cyprus’ image abroad. Proactive and transparent communication about the efforts and improvements made in addressing AML/CFT issues can help rebuild trust on an international scale.

He expressed optimism that the positive recommendation would be taken into consideration by the 27 EU member states.""On November 8, the European Commission provided a positive recommendation to 27 states to grant Georgia candidate status. I sincerely hope that the 27 states will take into account this positive recommendation.

I am glad that the government acted promptly and submitted the 9-step action plan to Brussels a few days ago. My colleagues at the European Commission will review this action plan, and they will provide feedback.Everyone should work together to complete these nine steps, requiring inclusiveness from the government and a constructive approach from the opposition,"" he added.December 3 marks the International Day for the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In a released statement, the Georgian Government reaffirmed its commitment to giving top priority to safeguarding the rights of individuals with disabilities and integrating their interests into state policies.""It is important to highlight that in 2023, the state submitted a report on the rights of persons with disabilities to the UN Committee, outlining the legal status of persons with disabilities in the country. Subsequently, the committee issued recommendations to the state.The interdepartmental coordination committee for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, established at the initiative of the Prime Minister in 2021, will persist in promoting and coordinating the implementation of the recommendations received from the committee, working in conjunction with the Advisory Council of Persons with Disabilities.As per the Law of On the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, public institutions continue to collaborate with organizations dedicated to the rights of persons with disabilities to develop and execute annual action plans.On September 5, 2022, the Government of Georgia approved the second national strategy for the protection of human rights for 2022-2030, and on March 23, 2023, the strategy received parliamentary approval.

1144144102,20231204,"Zimbabwe has become obstructed with falsehoods deliberately designed to undermine Government.

Recently a rumour that Vice President Chiwenga had been fired made rounds on social media. The idea of such rumours is mostly designed to tarnish the image of the Government.

Falsehoods have also been circulating that the increase in passport fees by the Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube when he presented the 2024 national budget is meant to ban Zimbabweans from travelling.

This is aimed at setting the people against their Government. Misinformation pervades Zimbabwean politics and it spreads faster than the wild fires.

The outcome of the 2023 harmonised elections is perhaps the most pressing issue in point.

Every serious-minded political and legal inquiry into the subject including reports by institutions such as the SADC and European Union have rejected former CCC’s assertion that the opposition party did not lose the elections.

Major media organisations now routinely label these statements “lies.” Yet CCC’s unfounded claims have gained wide traction among its followers.

Misinformation and the political effects of rumours is so damaging to any system.

There is an African saying which says, “A home is not built on gossip and rumours.” True to that, power is not gained through misinformation and gossip.

Misinformation has affected Zimbabwean politics, from the early days of independence to today.

Today, in the age of social media, citizens are actively engaged in crafting and spreading information to others and in some cases without verifying the facts.

Surprisingly often, these rumours share similarities to conspiracy theories and portray the ruling party as “evil”.

In the age of social media, the spread of political rumours is fast.

Why are people susceptible to political rumours? How does the rumours affect political trust, and when can their potential harmful effects be remedied? These questions have been asked in all circles of politics.

Rumours and misinformation play a role in Zimbabwean politics-and a dangerous one with direct consequences, such as wrecking trust in Government, promoting hostility towards truth-finding and swaying public opinion on otherwise popular policies.

If misinformation crowds out the truth, how can Zimbabweans communicate with one another about important issues?

It is sad that political rumours exist and persist despite the unsubstantiated and refuted claims. Unfortunately, many people are most likely to believe falsehoods and this causes a stir in the political arena.

Many political actors and their handlers have weaponised mistruths.

Coming to grips with misinformation is really hard in this day of social media as anyone with a phone can become a journalist.

There is need to accept the challenge and reframe our thinking about misinformation.

We must not just think about the message we must also think about the messenger.

While not many people believe a lot of false political rumours, others believe and that is enough to cause confusion and distress.

Some people accept political rumours and genuinely believe them; at the same time, partisanship heavily influences what people are willing to believe.

As a country we need to worry about the people spreading falsehoods and those who are gullible to the rumours.

Falsehoods have the potential to undermine democratic functioning of our society and as Zimbabweans we must rise against rumours and its mongers.

We must not only focus on how to set the record straight but how to stop and punish the perpetrators of such destructive practices.

On the other hand, it is much more effective when a political leader tells the truth to their followers, at the expense of their own self-interest.

We must learn to be responsible leaders and wedge a political fight honestly and fairly without spreading lies about those around us.

Those who spread falsehoods through social media should have their accounts closed.

The prevalence of anti-Government falsehoods in Zimbabwe, may have an effect on people’s trust in authorities.

The opposition uses misinformation to promote falsehoods to reduce citizens’ trust in the Government.

Falsehoods will erode political support in any state.

The ‘Jingoes’ who… sang “We’ve got the ships, we’ve got the men, we’ve got the money too” accurately diagnosed the three essential elements of political power: armaments, man-power, and economic power.

But man-power is not reckoned by mere counting of heads. The art of persuasion has always been a necessary part of the equipment of the political leader.

It is the duty of the media to accurately inform the audience and to put the record straight on certain issues.

By correctly packaging and disseminating news through the proper channels, it is possible to alter the public’s perception of false news.

As a country we must have responsible politicians.

It is not easy to find politicians who will willingly speak out against their own perceived self-interest, even in service of the truth.

It took the courage of Sengezo Tshabangu to wave a magic wand and whip CCC into line. He managed to bring them down to earth.

It can be debated how costly or not it would be for certain politicians to make those statements and take a bold move like Tshabangu.

Overall, though, significant evidence points to the powerful role that politicians play in shaping public beliefs, misinformation is difficult to combat because of the way it aligns with partisan interest.

It should be clear that misinformation is evil and fighting it is easier with responsible leadership. Misinformation strives in situations which are exacerbated by the lack of credible public information from media.

Rumours can also be detrimental in democracy. Falsehoods can be even more destructive to democratic governments, since they are an alternative form of media that directly competes with official information and mainstream media, and therefore constitutes a counter-power against official power and official truth.

Sanctions have been imposed on Zimbabwe because of such falsehoods against Government.

While opposition propaganda is in most cases inaccurate, exaggerated or purely fabricated, these claims and myths have been accepted by some individuals and organisations.

Although rumours can circulate via various means of communication, internet rumours especially social media (for example, microblogging), have dramatically increased the ease, speed and extent of rumour propagation.

Despite the presence of censorship, the internet has become the most dynamic, contentious, and even chaotic battleground for information and ideas in Zimbabwe.

Understanding the political challenges posed by information on the internet will enable people to survive the wave of falsehoods that circulate in the country.

Citizens are susceptible to thinly evidenced anti-Government falsehoods, but they can also be persuaded by the authorities if the latter can bring forth powerful evidence to support their story or win the endorsement of public figures widely perceived to be independent.

Unless the underlying political and socio-economic issues are somehow addressed, rumours will erode political support in any state.

A professor of Politics, Prof Berinsky says, “It’s that politicians are not behaving in a responsible way. We shouldn’t only blame the people. We should blame the politicians who are spreading misinformation”

Indeed, he adds, “If we’re looking for a lasting fix to the problem, it’s not that we can inoculate people against misinformation, or come up with a perfect way to correct for misinformation after the fact. What we need to do is reduce the misinformation coming from politicians. That’s easier said than done.”

To deal with misinformation Government should introduce laws which will deal with whoever originates or distribute falsehoods in any form.-[email protected]"

1144175786,20231204,"In a published Saturday, U.K. legislators in the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons – the lower chamber of Parliament – expressed their concerns about the U.K.’s plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a February consultation. The government was “likely needed” in the future.

Countries around the world are looking into CBDCs as a way to improve payments and make central banks embrace digital finance. While the U.S. is still undecided on whether a digital dollar is worth the fuss, all eyes are on Europe, where the U.K. and the European Union (EU) are proposing actual plans for CBDCs for private retail payments.

The EU’s plans for a digital iteration of the euro have taken some heat from the bloc’s lawmakers . While U.K. lawmakers seem to agree with the EU’s proposals for a lower individual holding limit for the digital euro to prevent customer exodus from banks, they don’t seem to agree with blocking CBDCs from earning interest and thereby treating them like cash.

“We recommend that the Bank of England and Treasury undertake further analysis on the monetary policy impact of paying interest on the digital pound, and in the meantime, ensure that their design work does not preclude the possibility of paying interest on the digital pound,” the U.K. legislators said.

The U.K. Treasury’s plans for a digital pound clearly stated that, like cash “and many current accounts, no interest would be paid on a digital pound. This makes it useful for everyday payments but not designed or intended for savings.""

The lawmakers also cautioned against the proposed 10,000- 20,000 British pound ($12,663 - $25,320) holding limit, and instead proposed a lower limit similar to the 3000 euro cap proposed by the EU’s European Central Bank “to reduce the risk of large-scale outflows from bank deposits into digital pounds… with a view to increasing it over time.""

Somewhat matching , the U.K. Treasury Committee report also said it’s unclear if the benefits of a digital pound outweigh potential risks and warned that digital pound legislation should not allow the government to gather user data from payments “beyond what is permitted by law enforcement.”

“Nevertheless, we support the Bank of England and Treasury undertaking further consultative work on the design of a digital pound to enable it to be launched if benefits increase and risks to privacy and financial stability are mitigated.""

The committee recommended that the government and Bank of England set out in more detail as soon as possible the criteria that will inform its final decision to issue a digital pound.

Seeing as a decision to issue a CBDC is pending, lawmakers also want to hold the government accountable for the costs of studying and designing a digital pound and want the Bank of England and the country’s Treasury to keep track of these expenses.

The U.K. Treasury is expected to drop its response to the consultation on its proposed model for a digital pound soon. This will be followed by an before a decision on whether to issue one is made."

1144205240,20231204,"Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, has stressed the role of circular economy in China's climate actions, saying it's an important choice for sustainable development.

He made the remarks in an event themed on circular economy in the China pavilion, which was held on the sidelines of the COP28 United Nations climate change conference in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.

China has listed promoting circular economy as one of its 10 major actions to realize its climate targets of peaking carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and realizing carbon neutrality before 2060, Xie noted.

The practice in China proves that circular economy can play an important role in tackling the climate crisis, he said.

Quoting data from China Association of Circular Economy, he said the development of circular economy in China in 2022 helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to over 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.

""It's contribution is really big,"" he said.

Xie also highlighted circular economy as an important part in China's climate cooperation with other countries.

In their Sunnylands Statement on Enhancing Cooperation to Address the Climate Crisis, the United States and China decided to operationalize the Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, one of the focuses of which is about circular economy and resource efficiency, he said.

The statement was made public following a meeting between Xie and his US counterpart John Kerry from Nov 4 to 7.

The European Union and China extended a Memorandum of Understanding on Circular Economy they signed in 2018 for another five years at a EU-China High-Level Policy Dialogue on Circular Economy in September, he said.

Xie said he looks forward to seeing the establishment of an international cooperation platform at COP28 to promote pragmatic cooperation in circular economy development and other sectors."

The agreement was signed on the sidelines of COP28 climate conference in Dubai, during which Touqan highlighted the project's key role in enhancing water security and boosting overall economic development according to the Jordan News Agency, Petra.

She also conveyed gratitude towards EIB's support for the national project, as the loan signing follows a previous loan of 200 million euros signed on December 8, 2022, bringing the bank's total commitment to 300 million euros.

Acknowledging the European Union's role in securing the investment grant, Touqan emphasised that both funding streams — the loan and the grant — will be channeled through the EIB.

This financial package aligns with the wider European support announced during the recent visit of His Majesty King Abdullah to Brussels, including a loan of 100 million euros allocated for the National Carrier project and two investment grants of 97 million euros.

Touqan, in a COP28 side event, has met with the vice-president of the European Investment Bank in Dubai, with discussions centering on the Bank's priority areas of support in Jordan, which are intertwined with the Kingdom's Economic Modernisation Vision.

Touqan took the opportunity to highlight the importance of the partnership with the EIB and expressed her gratitude for the financial support received in vital sectors such as education, water, sanitation, transport, energy, private sector development and infrastructure.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki will demand that the permit system for Ukrainian trucks passing through and arriving in Poland should be restored, in view of a month-long protest at the border.

Polish drivers have been blocking border crossings since Nov. 6, complaining that their business has been undercut by Ukrainian firms. They want the European Union (EU) to reinstate commercial permits for Ukrainian companies to operate in the bloc, which were waived soon after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.

The drivers also call for the suspension of operating permits for Ukrainian haulage firms, which were established after the beginning of the conflict.

""We will very strongly and unequivocally demand the restoration of transport permits for Ukrainian drivers,"" Morawiecki told reporters.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's border service said on Monday that the first 30 empty lorries had driven through a newly opened Uhryniv-Dolhobychuv crossing on the Ukrainian-Polish border. Kyiv hopes this will provide some relief, with Polish driver protests blocking other land corridors.

The waiting time on Monday at the Hrebenne crossing was 10 days, with around 900 trucks stuck in a 70-km queue, the Polish Press Agency reported. Meanwhile, around 520 trucks were waiting in another 16-km-long queue at the Dorohusk crossing, with a five-day clearance time, according to the police in Chelm, a city in southeastern Poland near the border with Ukraine. ■"

At his meetings in Brussels a nd Prague, Clinton should insist that NATO continue to be the premier collective security organization in Europe, able to defend America's vital economic and security interests in Europe into the 21st century. To do this, he should assure NATO allies that the U.S. will maintain an adequate military pmence in Europe. He should also reach out to Central and Eastern European nations that suffered Soviet domination for nearly half a century and help to restore their nghtfbl place in Western security institutio ns. Finally, while in Moscow, Clinton should encourage democra!s to continue with reforms at home and choose cooperation over confrontation with the West.

The NATO ""Partnership for Peace PFP) will provide the framework within which al liance transformation can take place.The PFP was proposed by Secretary of Defense LRs Aspin October 20,1993, at a meeting of NATO defense ministen inTravemfinde, Ger mauy, and endorsed by NATO foreign ministers on December 9,1993, in Brussels.

NATO heads of state will give fi nal approval at their summit meeting in Brussels on Jan uary 10-11 NATO leaders arc expected to approve at the Brussels summit a process by which some, but not necessarily all, members will be able to use NATO facilities and capabili ties for non-NATO con tingencies, such as peacekeeping and humanitaiian operations.

The process, known as Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF will allow the United States to avoid military involvement in missions which have little bearing on U.S. national hter as. Permitting the u se of NATO bases, logistics networks, and communications capabil ities will encourage America's Ewopean allies to continue regarding an American-led NATO as the only viable collective security organization in Europe.

Clintons Partnership for Peace and the Combined Joint Task Force concept are neces sary first steps toward eventual expansion of the alliance that acknowledges the dramatic changes Europe has seen in the past five years. They properly place the responsibility of membership on those nations, s u ch as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, that claim they are ready for membership. These nations will be given the time they need-at their own pace and initiative-to modify their national security structures, armed forces and budgets so that they ca n contribute to, rather than be a burden on, the alliance.

The Clinton Administrations proposals preserve the stability of the alliance at a time of great uncertainty in Europe and Eurasia. The recent elections in Russia in which hard line nationalists, co mmunists, and other non-democrats polled well, underscore the need for NATO to be deliberate in expanding its security umbrella eastward.

The hope of many in 1989 that it was only a matter of time before a United States of Europe would provide for its own defense had given way by 1993 to frustra t ion, high lighted by the failure of the European Community to stop the bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia and a monetary crisis in the fall of 1992 that caused the collapse of the European monetary system. By the October 1993 meeting at Travemiinde, the c o nsensus sentiment was that NATO was here to stay, but that it also needed a redefinition of mem bership and mission Euphoria Turns to Frustration. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, there was widespread satisfaction that NATO had done its job. As Presiden t George Bush noted in February 1990, the Eastern European countries are throwing off the yoke of com munism. The policy of NATO has prevailed. What followed was an undeniable sense of euphoria. One analyst questioned whether or not communisms collapse and triumph of democratic capitalism marked the resolution of the Hegelian dialectic and, thus, the end of history.2 Responsible observers of Americas Cold War foreign policy suggested that the U.S. military presence in Europe could soon be reduced to a token level as a united Europe shouldered greater responsibility for her own defense?

For their part, throughout 1990 and 1991 the nations of the European Community negotiated the Treaty of European Union, signed at Maastricht, The Netherlands, in December 199

1. The treaty established a common foreign and security policy, the forerunner of a European collective security body that would also serve as a European pillar within NATO.

Col d War had ended and the Soviet Union was gone, it was too early to tell what the final complexion of Europe would be. European public opinion was the first to reflect this: Danish voters rejected the Maastricht Treaty when it was put to a referendum in Ma y 1992, while France-traditionally the country most desirous of a diminution of American influence in Europe-approved.the treaty by just a narrow 5 1 percent to 49 percent in September 19

There cannot be European secu rity without the United States. i Reflecting the new consensus, NATO defense ministers met at Travemunde in October 1993 to lay the groundwork for a revitalization of the alliance. Whil e at Travemunde, the ministers had to grapple with three principal realities 0 The U.S. wished to continue its significant military presence in Europe.The Clin ton Administration was committed to a presence of at least 100,OOO troops 8 The transition to de m ocracy in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union was not complete, and should not be assumed. Just three weeks earlier, an anti-reform coup in Moscow led to the occupation of the parliament build ing by the armed forces Europe faced securi ty challenges different from those of the Cold War, including regional and ethnic conflicts.

The Clinton Administration proposed the Partnership for Peace (PFP) and the Com bined Joint Task Force concept at Travemunde in response to these realities. The pr oposal met with broad support by the NATO defense ministers, and the run-up to the January 1994 NATO summit began in earnest. NATO foreign ministers endorsed the proposals in December 1993, and heads of state are expected to approve them at the sum mit.

T HE PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE The Partnership for Peace (PFP) is an invitation to non-members to begin working closely with NATO organizations-to become a partner of the alliance-and learn both the opportunities and responsibilities of membership in that compl ex organization.

The offer envisions that each partner will negotiate with NATO to identify its desired level of participation.

For example, the Czech Republic may offer NATO use of an ordnance firing range in exchange for the opportunity to learn NATO firing procedures.

At the same time, NATO will establish a planning cell at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SKAPE) in Mons, Belgium, so that staff officers fiom partner nations can participate in NATO training and exercise planning unpublished st udy.

September 8,1993. 6 7 lbid 5 The strength of the PFP is that it is self-selective; it creates a free market for even tual NATO membership, depending on a partners willingness to participate in alliance diplomatic and military institutions and to transform its national security structures to resemble those o f alliance nations. For example, while no specific criteria have been es tablished, a partner hoping to be considered for NATO membership must satisfy basic re quirements. These are Leaning Forward. Until the PFP was announced, many in Europe and the U.S b elieved that NATO must do something* for former Warsaw Pact countries in Central and Eastern Europe that had suffered under Soviet domination. Many continue to feel that NATOs security guarantees should be extended to such countries as Hungary Poland, and the Czech Republic. Typical of this sentiment was an opinion article from the Prague daily newspaper Lidova Demokrucie, in which the author asserted that the Yalta Accords on the post-war division of influence in Europe between the West and the East have n ot yet been replaced with anything else The same article compares the Travemunde meeting to the 1938 Munich Conference, at which British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain betrayed Czechoslovakia in the face of imminent Nazi occupation of the German-popul ated regions.

As understandable as such sentiment is, its advocates ignore the fact that the British and French capitulation at Munich came despite security guarantees each had made to Czechoslovakia In fact, it was precisely because Britain and France wer e in no position to honor their guarantees that they sought a negotiated settlement to the crisis. Neither country was ready for war with Germany, and leaders in both countries felt Hitlers desire for territorial expansion would be satisfied with portions of Czechoslovakia 1 X Maintaining civilian control of military forces 1 Publishing defense budgets X Reorganizing force structures and command authorities, while developing equipment and communications capabilities to make them compatible with NATO 8 Edit orial, Frosty Wind From Yalta, Lidova Demkracie, October 22, 19

A-12 6 With public interest in NATO waning and defense budgets shrinking, European cries of another Munich sellout fall on deaf ears. The Partnership f o r Peace plan is, in fact ahead of public opinion in most NATO countries. There is little or no public pressure in the U.S. and Western Europe to expand NATO beyond its current membership COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCES If the Partnership for Peace takes a firs t, albeit tentative, step toward NATO member ship expansion, the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept addresses the need for the alliance to redefine its missions for the threats it must face in post-Cold War Europe.

NATO will find itself having to add ress crises that are short of the armed attack by hos tile forces envisioned in the NATO treaty, including regional and ethnic conflicts such as in the former Yugoslavia. Peacekeeping and humanitarian operations will also become more common, and NATO shou ld have the capability to respond to such requirements.

The Combined Joint Task Force concept is a step towards redefining future alliance mis sions How CJTFs Will Work. Details remain to be worked out, but CJTFs will probably be established as permanent s hadow organizations within existing major subordinate com mands in NATO, existing on paper only until they are needed to respond to an emergen cy. For example, the Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Central (AFCENT) will direct a senior officer within hi s command (a general or admiral of 1- to 3-star rank) to develop a standing contingency task forcestaff within the organization to respond, for ex ample, to a regional crisis involving a mass exodus of refugees.

The CJTF would be available for crises to wh ich NATO as a whole chooses not to respond. Such crises might be peacekeeping or humanitarian operations not covered in Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which provides for collective security against an armed attack against one or more members. As envisioned by NATO planners CJTF activities may not even be in NATOs area of operations as described in treaty Article 6 Under these conditions, the CJTF would be activated and separated from its parent command (Allied Forces, Central in the example above), but augm e nted with NATO and non-NATO personnel as may be necessary given the crisis. For example, if a peacekeep ing mission were established by the Commander of the CJTF he may ask for and receive forces from non-NATO countries that wish to contribute. Furthermor e, if the U.S. had chosen not to participate, it may still choose to lend non-combatant support in areas in which it has unique expertise, such as airlift and certain communications capabilities.

CJTFs would replicate an arrangement that already exists, fo r example in the former Yugoslavia. The NATO major subordinate commander-the Commander in Chief of Al lied Forces South (AFS0UTH)-has a French deputy commander, even though France is not a part of NATOs integrated military command. A French general wasass igned to this post because France has ground troops involved in the United Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia. In a similar fashion, non-NATO members such as Poland or Hun gary could serve on CJTF staffs in some future contingency.

The CJTF will provid e an avenue for participation in operations involving NATO members using NATO facilities for those nations pursuing the Partnership for Peace. For example, if the Czech Republic becomes a NATO partner, Prague may decide to assign 7 Czech staff officers an d a Czech infantry battalion to a CJTF performing a peacekeeping operation in Romania.

At the same time, the CJTF preserves NATO as the premier security organization in Europe, giving it (and, thus, the United States) the right of first refusal on future c on flicts. If the U.S. did not choose to participate in a peacekeeping operation in Romania for example, then that operation could be conducted by a CJTF using NATO facilities without being considered as a NATO operation. As adjunct staffs to NATO major s u bor dinate commands, CJTFs will have full access to and use of NATO facilities: head quarters, communications, tactical publications and procedures, and logistics. Thus, the European Union (formerly the European Community) will have a defense component as called for in the Maastricht Treaty, but one that has its roots in the Atlantic Alliance.

Whether that defense component is an ad hoc collection of forces, a coalition of two or three willing European Union nations, or the entire ten-nation Western Europe an Union will depend on the nature of the crisis. But if it is organized as a Combined Joint Task Force, it will be an outgrowth of NATO, and the transatlantic nature of European security will be perpetuated RUSSIA AND NATO EXPANSION Russian official atti t ude toward NATO expansion has been erratic. In August 1993 President Boris Yeltsin made state visits to Poland and Slovakia, and said then that he would not object to NATO membership for either country. This understandably raised ex pectations in Central and Eastern Europe that the alliance would make offers of member ship to the larger nations in the region.

Shortly after the anti-reform coup attempt in early October 1993, though, Yeltsin wrote a letter to NATO Secretary-General Manfred W6mer advising tha t Russia would per ceive alliance expansion as a threatening gesture from the West. Many Russia observers believe that Yeltsin gained the support of the armed forces during the coup in part by agreeing to a harder line regarding foreign policy in the near abroad, as the area of the former Soviet Union is called in Russian military doctrine. That harder line presumab ly includes resistance to an Atlantic Alliance reinvigorated with new members from Central and Eastem Europe.

Reaction in aspiring NATO member states was to perceive Yeltsins letter as a veto over the ultimate disposition of the alliance. The West apparently respects more the views of Russia than the wishes expressed by former Soviet satellites..!2 was the way one Czech newspaper expressed the w idespread sentiment in the region. Thus, when the NATO defense ministers met to discuss the American Partnership for Peace proposal in late October 1993, the belief throughout Central and Eastem Europe was that a more ag gressive offer had been precluded b y the Yeltsin letter to Womer 11 William E. Odom, Yeltsins Deal with the Devil, Hudson Opinion, Number 29, November 1993 12 Aspin: Healerof Illusions. Svobodne Slovo, October 22, 1993, as cited in USIA Daily Digest of Foreign Media Reaction October 22,199 3 8 In a December 1993 trip to Brussels, Yeltsin discussed the plan with Worner, who sub sequently said he believed that there is a chance that Russia will participate in the partner~hip But just as Russia was warming to the idea of a closer relationship w i th NATO, the disappointing election results in Russia have reminded NATO of its core function: to defend the nations of Western Europe against an expansionist threat from the East. Such a threat can no longer be ruled out, given the strong support shown f o r the xenophobic and belligerent Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic Party AN ACTIVIST AGENDA FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON The PFP and CJTF concepts are a credible response to the demands for the transforma tion of NATO. They are certain to be approv ed by the alliance during the January 10-1 1 summit in Brussels.

But President Clinton should seize the opportunity at the NATO summit to outline a vision for NATO that goes beyond these transition arrangements. Poland the Czech Republic, and Hungary were forcibly pulled from their traditional Western orientation after World War n. With the defeat of Soviet communism in the Cold War, the United States can now correct that tragedy by encouraging these important countries to become not only partners, but eve ntually members of NATO.

At the same time, Russia must be encouraged to continue on the path of democratic reform. President Clinton must balance Russias concerns about an expansionist NATO with the need to check a revanchist Russia should reforms fail. By fostering a NATO partnership with Moscow, perhaps toward eventual membership in NATO as well, the US-led Atlantic Alliance can straddle the gulf of mistrust that continues to exist be tween Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

Clinton must demonstrate the leadership Europe expects from the United States as the only superpower. The Presidents comments throughout his trip will be closely watched for the signals that will determine the success or failure of the Partnership for Pea c e and Combined Joint Task Force initiatives rhus, while in Brussels at the NATO summit, President Clinton should d Support partnership offers only to nations of the former Warsaw Treaty Organiza tion or the republics of the former Soviet Union The interna t ional organizations in Europe comprise a confusing alphabet soup threatening to cancel each others effectiveness: the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), the Western European Union (WEU the European Union (EU the European FreeTrade Association (EJTA), to name but a few. Unlike these organizations, NATO has the clarity of purpose and the diplomatic and military structures to plan, equip, and train for collective security 13 Russia Is Likely t o Join NATO Nations in 1994 Exercises, The Los Angeles Times, December 10,1993, p. 2 9 To prevent NATO from becoming another talking salon within Europe, where much is discussed but little accomplished, future membership in the alliance should be limited t o those European nations that experienced Soviet domination and in vasion. Doing so will limit the number of potential new NATO members, thus precluding an overextension of NATOs borders and commitments. It will also permit NATO to focus on those countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary that are best suited to participate in NATO planning and training activities. Russia should be offered partnership and considered for eventual membership as should the European republics of the former Soviet Union. A useful precedent is the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which applies only to those republics west of the Urals. This would properly preclude former Soviet Central Asia from considera tion for future NATO membership In addition to t rying to keep participation limited for practical considerations, there is an ideological consistency If such Cold War neutral nations as Switzerland and Sweden could avoid the great clashes of ideals that World War II and the Cold War represented, then t h ey ought not be offended by not being invited to take part in the partnership that will define the transatlantic security order into the 21st century.14 d Announce that the US. will support NATO membership for key democratic partners as soon as they are r e ady for the military and financial responsibilities of alliance The PFP announcement at Travemiinde in late-October 1993 was met in Central and Eastern Europe with disappointment. The widespread belief among policy makers in Prague, Warsaw, and Budapest w a s that the U.S. decided not to offer them immedi ate membership because it did not to want to appear to threaten Russia in the wake of the anti-reform coup attempt there three weeks before. The nations of Central and Eastern Europe fear being marginalized in a balance of power conflict between NATO and Russia as expressed by Jiri Payne, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com mittee in the Czech Parliament, The United States would like to have Russia as a strategic partner in Europe.

Such sentiment, while unde rstandable, implies that the U.S. gets whatever it wants within the alliance, thus overstating the degree to which the U.S. is able to control events at NATO. The Partnership for Peace and Combined Joint Task Forces are the most that can now be expected o f the alliance because of NATO public opposition to expanded defense commitments.

NATO aspirants will need time to become an asset rather than a burden to the al liance by converting their armed forces to make them compatible with those of their future all ies. Moreover, NATO leaders will need time to prepare their publics for the additional commitments required by the expansion of NATO. The Partnership for Peace will provide that time, and should be used by NATO and the partners to pursue 15 14 Austrian ne utrality was a condition imposed by NATO and Soviet Union in 19

Nonetheless, at least for the initial moves toward NATO expansion that the PIT represents, Cold War neutrals are and ought to be of secondary priority behind the captive nations of the for mer Warsaw Treaty Organization and former Soviet Union 15 Closing of NATO Door Makes CzechThink About Spheres of Interest, Prague News, December 2-16,1993. p. 3 10 an aggressive plan that can lead to membership. At Brussels, though, President Clin ton sho u ld state unequivocally that future membership in the alliance will be deter mined by the initiative shown by PFP participants, and that the United States will sup port enlarging NATO not only when participants have made the necessary changes to their nati onal security structures and armed forces, but when NATO determines that allowing them to join is in the collective interest of the alliance.

Poland, and Russia the incentive to work closely with NATO to forge a partnership that transcends the need for ear ly and overt security guarantees, which the allies are simply unprepared to make now. While no such guarantee would be implied by a unilateral U.S. declaration of this nature, it would give clear direction toward the goal of membership for those countries looking for U.S. leadership. Said the ambassador to the U.S. of one of these countries Such a declaration will give countries such as Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Brussels summit should unambiguously reiterate that the Atlantic Alliance is an open org a nization ready to accept new mem rs whenever it sees the circumstances appropriate for such an expansion IF d Encourage key allies to establish bilateral ties of assistance with democratic partners that best demonstrate the initiative towards partnership a nd eventual mem bership Those partners that wish to fulfill partnership agreements quickly and move toward NATO membership will need assistance on many fronts: advice, training, and equip ment.17 Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary already have strong bilateral relationships with a number of key NATO allies, including the United Kingdom France, Germany, and Italy; there are several East-West officer exchange programs for example.

During private talks with the leaders of key allies, Clinton should encou rage them to expand ties with aspiring NATO allies, including Russia. This could be achieved by coordinating activities that can foster the transition to NATO membership. These could include Officer exchange programs between headquarters staffs Exchange p r ograms at military academies and war colleges Joint training exercises at the company and battalion level Defense equipment sales from the NATO nations' stockpiles Training NATO aspirants in defense accounting and procurement procedures 16 ""Comments on th e Expansion of NATO and the 'Partnership for Peace' Initiative Unpublished ""non-paper"" from a Central European Ambassador to the U.S., December 9,1993 17 A broad discussion of many of these areas can be found in Raoul Henri Alcala, Rapporteur.

As part of this process, a summit of NATO members and partners should be convened in 1995 to review the progress of countries aspiring to membership lantic security landscape with allies and their partners. At the sa me time, those part ners that have made sufficient progress can be considered for NATO membership.

NATO leaders might also consider establishing specific criteria for NATO member ship at that summit. These could include ceilings on defense spending as a pe rcentage of gross domestic product, publicly available defense budgets, and civilian control of the armed forces The 1995 European Security Summit would be an opportunity to review the transat d Oppose partnership for Ukraine until Kiev honors its interna t ional obligations to rat ify without qualification the START I Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty NPT In September 1992, Ukraine freely acceded to the so-called Lisbon Protocol, named for the city in which the agreement between the U.S. and t h e four nuclear-armed re publics of the former Soviet Union was signed. Kiev thus committed itself to ratifying the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) I and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty NPT In doing so, Ukraine became a successor state to the former Soviet Union, bound by the international obligations of those two treaties.

Despite repeated declarations that he would do so, President Leonid Kravchuk has found several reasons to avoid honoring the protocol. In November 1993, the Ukrai nian Parli ament ratified START I, but attached so many conditions and interpretations so as to make the action meaningless.

Whatever the reasons for these actions may be, Ukraine is failing to live up to an in ternational commitment. That alone should disqualify it from participating in the Part nership for Peace and, by extension, from membership in NATO. If Kiev cannot live up to existing international commitments, there is no reason to believe that it would comply with the new ones that the Atlantic Alliance wou l d impose. Therefore, until Ukraine ratifies START I and the NPT, it should not be invited to participate in the Since then, Ukraine has reneged on its commitment to ratify START I and the NPT PFP d Declare Americas intention not to participate militarily i n peacekeeping and hu manitarian operations which have no bearing on US. vital national interests One important aspect of the Combined Joint Task Force concept will be to permit the use of NATO facilities and capabilities for operations that do not consti tute an armed attack on a NATO member (as prescribed in Article 5 of the NATO Treaty 12 Such contingencies could include peacekeeping and humanitarian operations in places such as Bosnia or other areas of the former Yugoslavia.

Americans saw in 1993 the hi gh cost of U.S. military involvement in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations where no vital national interests are at stake. More than two dozen young men died needlessly in Somalia in a humanitarian operation that was destined for tragedy once the ob j ectives went beyond feeding the hungry. A cruel irony of America's superpower status is that such an expansion of objectives is all but inevitable once it chooses to become involved If the American people equate Combined Joint Task Forces with peacekeepin g , in asmuch as they now equate peacekeeping with what happened in Somalia, they will not support the expansion of NATO's missions the CJTFs represent. At the NATO summit, Clinton should declare that as a rule, the U.S. will not involve U.S. combat forces i n peacekeeping and humanitarian operations conducted by Combined Joint Task Forces. However, the U.S. may provide logistics and communications support While in Prague President Clinton should d Declare a U.S. desire to see Poland, the Czech Republic, and H ungary enter NATO as soon as they are ready NATO is not ready for new members.

He also should declare that the U.S. will support additional membership of NATO for democratic nations that participate in the Partnership for Peace and make the necessary changes to their security struc tures and armed forces that NATO requires.

Such a non-binding-decla ration from the United States will give these countries the hope they need: having once thrown off the communist yoke, they will not be ignored 18 For a full discussion, see Thomas P.

President Clinton should propose a series of bilateral assistance programs for Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. These pr ograms should include Officer exchange programs between headquarters staffs X Exchange programs at military academies and war colleges X Joint training exercises at the company and battalion level X Defense equipment sales from U.S. stockpiles Training in U.S. defense accounting and procurement procedures.

There are a number of potential funding sources for such programs, the cost of which would be minimal in any case. (Estimates of PFP costs per year vary from $5 million to $30 million?l) As part of estab lished security assistance programs, several million dollars a year are already available for foreign officer training under the auspices of the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program.

There is yet another potential source of funding. Soon after the end of the Cold War, Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Richard Lugar (R-IN) developed legislation to provide funding for the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union.

Since 1991, more than $1 billion has been authorized to assist Russia, Kazakhstan Belarus, and Ukraine in this way. The Clinton Administration should recommend that Congress authorize the use of Nunn-Lugar funds to support the Partnership for Peace.

Another potential source of funds is the President's defense conversion program.

The Clinton Administration has proposed $20 billion to help the U.S. defense industry convert from military to civilian production. Analysts at The Heritage Foundation have determined that Clinton's proposa l will do more harm than good by encouraging defense firms with skills and capabilities unique and vital to America's defense in 20 Manfred Womer, ""NATO Transformed: The Significance of the Rome Summit NATO Review, December 1991 p. 4 21 ""Money is Next NAT O Hurdle In Integrating East Europeans Defense News, December 13-19,1993, p. 3 14 dustrial base to abandon defense production?2 The Heritage analysts concluded that much of the $20 billion will become little more than high-tech pork barrel funding for key c ongressional districts. This being the case, Clinton's defense conversion program should be canceled altogether, with a small amount of the money earmarked for the bilateral assistance programs described here While in Moscow, President Clinton should d De c lare his desire to see a democratic Russia enter NATO as soon as it is ready When he first articulated his vision of strategic defense in March 1983, President Ronald Reagan understood that even a system designed for purely defensive purposes could be see n as threatening to a regime as insecure as the Soviet Union. Acknow ledging this problem, Reagan boldly offered to share America's strategic defense tech nologies with the Soviet Union.

President Clinton can provide the same type of courageous vision by o ffering to bring Russia into the Atlantic Alliance In Moscow, he should announce that the PFP is open to Moscow on the same terms offered to Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, and some nations of the former Soviet empire. Those terms include the prospect of future mem bership for those partners who restructure their armed forces and defense organiza tions to make them compatible with NATO.

Such an offer would undermine the sentiments expressed by such Russians as Yev geny Primakov, head of the Russian foreign intel ligence service, who noted last December that ""an extension of NATO's krritory to [Russia's] doorstep"" would be a threat to Russian security?' It would also encourage Moscow to continue on the path of democratic institutional reform by encouraging civilia n control of the armed forces and open defense budgets d Offer U.S. assistance to Russia to convert its national security structure and armed forces to be compatible with NATO President Clinton should make the same offer of assistance to Russia as recom me n ded for Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. For funding, he should ask Congress to authorize the release of funds appropriated under the Nunn-Lugar legisla tion for denuclearization of the former Soviet Union. He should also use money saved from canc e lling his defense conversion program d Make no joint declarations of security guarantees for Central and Eastern Europe Some in Central and Eastern Europe have expressed disappointment with the limited goals of the Partnership for Peace. They fear being s o ld out by the West with President Yeltsin 22 See Baker Spring Supporting the Force: The Industrial Base and Defense Conversion Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 964, October 22.1993 23 ""NATO Backs Broader Links With Ex-Soviet Allies The New Yonk Times, December 3, 1993, p. 7 15 which puportedly fears antagonizing Russia, openly comparing the proposal to the Western powers capitulation at Yalta during World War II Hungary are understandably leery of high-minded declarations from the West and Moscow regar d ing their future. Clinton should avoid granting Russia any special peacekeeping role in Central and Eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union. Russian offers to participate in European peacekeeping operations should be handled within the context of Combin e d Joint Task Forces, an extension of NATO Having lived through this experience, leaders in Poland, the Czech Republic, and d Discourage President Yeltsins request for modifications to theTreaty on Conven tional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE The Treaty on Co n ventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE between NATO, the republics of the former Soviet Union, and the former Warsaw Treaty Organization was one of a series of historic agreements negotiated by Presidents Reagan and Bush that provided vivid, legal proof th a t the Cold War was over. The CFE Treaty, for ex ample, precludes the stationing of troops by one signatory on the territory of another without the latters approval. By reducing the number of conventional forces in Europe, and thereby eliminating the possi b ility of surprise attack, the treaty guaran tees stability in Europe and is thwa linchpin of the post-Cold War security order In September 1993, Russia asked her treaty partners for relaxations of provisions limiting the number of tanks and other combat e q uipment in the so-called flank regions. The flank regions are described in the treaty as the borders around the Atlan tic-to-the-Urals area in Europe to which the treaty applies. Relaxing the equipment limits in this way would permit the Russians to mass forces in such areas as the Transcaucasus, where there has been much ethnic and regional tension.

Thus far, NATO has resisted antagonizing Moscow by outright opposition to the Russian request, which has been bottled up by the treatys cumbersome consultativ e procedure. However, the U.S. should be bold in preserving a treaty as important as CFE. Clintons trip to Moscow offers an opportunity for the U.S. topublicly and une quivocall oppose a fundamental change to one of the pillars of post-Cold War Europe?The r efore, Clinton should advise Yeltsin that the U.S. will oppose the Rus sian request for treaty relaxation CONCLUSION President Clintons first year foreign policy has been characterized by neglect, incon sistency, and drift. In the former Yugoslavia, the P r esident antagonized Americas European allies by raising the expectation of U.S. action but failing to deliver In Somalia, the Administration allowed a humanitarian operation to become U.N.-led par 24 President Clinton should be particularly concerned abou t an unravelling of the CFE Treaty. While his defense drawdown is excessive and ill-advised, it is unattainable without the lower European forces levels provided for in the CFE Treaty. See LawrenceT.

Meanwhile, a conces sionary approach to North Korean nuclear intransigence has allowed the hermit kingdom the time it needs to continue developing a nuclear weapon.

Despite his inauspicious start, the President has the opportunity t o start his second year on a better note. To do this, he must exhibit fum leadership at the NATO summit and subsequent visits to Prague and Moscow. The Partnership for Peace (PFP) and Combined Joint Task Force CJTF) concept lay the groundwork for a transf o rmation of the alliance at a pace that responds to American priorities: preserving NATO as the premier collec tive security institution in Europe; addressing the regional and ethnic threats facing the al liance; and beginning the process of expanding memb e rship to Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and perhaps even Russia threefold The strength of the proposals the Administration will sponsor at the NATO summit are 0 The PFP reaches out to former adversaries in the WarsawTreaty Organization and affords t h em the opportunity to work at their own level of interest and initiative with NATO political and military institutions, without offering security guaran tees or modifying the NATO Treaty in any way The CJTF concept preserves NATO as the point of departure for the European Unions defense component by permitting the use of NATO facilities and capabilities for non-NATO operations The PFP and CJTF together will put a NATO imprimatur on future peacekeeping and humanitarian operations in Eastern Europe and parts of the former Soviet Union, even on those involving non-NATO participants in regions outside of NATOs traditional area of operations.

But the President must go further yet. Six months after the NATO summit, in June 1994, he will be in France for the 50th anniversary of the allied landings at Normandy Beach. The best possible tribute to the memory of the 10,OOO brave young men who rest at Normandy will be if the President next week goes beyond the modest goals of the Partnership for Peace and creates a vis ion for European defense and security built on an expanded but still effective Atlantic Alliance."

In October 2023, German exports slightly declined by 0.2 per cent, and imports decreased by 1.2 per cent from September. Compared to October 2022, there was a significant drop of 8.1 per cent in exports and 16.3 per cent in imports. Despite these declines, Germany's trade surplus grew, reaching €18.1 billion, a notable increase from the previous year.

In contrast, trade with non-EU countries (third countries) indicated a positive trend. Exports to these countries rose by 2.9 per cent to €58.5 billion, while imports increased by 0.8 per cent to €51.8 billion. The US was the top destination for German exports, which surged by 5.7 per cent to €13.5 billion. Exports to China and the UK also saw increases of 1.5 per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively.

However, imports from China, the largest source of German imports, decreased by 2.4 per cent to €12.7 billion. Imports from the US and the UK showed mixed results, with a rise in imports from the US by 2.2 per cent and a substantial decline from the UK by 15.1 per cent.

Trade with Russia continued to decline, with exports decreasing by 5.0 per cent to €0.6 billion and imports increasing by 6.6 per cent to €0.2 billion. YoY, exports to Russia plummeted by 40.5 per cent, and imports were down by 88.5 per cent.

On a non-adjusted basis, Germany's exports in October 2023 were valued at €130.8 billion and imports at €112.7 billion, marking a decrease of 5.0 per cent in exports and 14.4 per cent in imports compared with October 2022. The unadjusted foreign trade balance showed a surplus of €18.1 billion, up from €6.1 billion in the same month last year."
1144331549,20231205,"Warsaw, Dec 5 : Poland is set to call for the European Commission to reinstate restrictions on Ukrainian trucks arriving at the country's border, the government announced.

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki will demand that the permit system for Ukrainian trucks passing through and arriving in Poland should be restored, in view of a month-long protest at the border, reports Xinhua news agency.

Polish drivers have been blocking border crossings since November 6, complaining that their business has been undercut by Ukrainian firms.

They want the European Union (EU) to reinstate commercial permits for Ukrainian companies to operate in the bloc, which were waived soon after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.

The drivers also call for the suspension of operating permits for Ukrainian haulage firms, which were established after the beginning of the conflict.

""We will very strongly and unequivocally demand the restoration of transport permits for Ukrainian drivers,"" Morawiecki told reporters.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's border service said on Monday that the first 30 empty lorries had driven through a newly opened Uhryniv-Dolhobychuv crossing on the Ukrainian-Polish border.

Kiev hopes this will provide some relief, with Polish driver protests blocking other land corridors.

The waiting time on Monday at the Hrebenne crossing was 10 days, with around 900 trucks stuck in a 70-km queue, the Polish Press Agency reported.

Meanwhile, around 520 trucks were waiting in another 16-km-long queue at the Dorohusk crossing, with a five-day clearance time, according to the police in Chelm, a city in southeastern Poland near the border with Ukraine."

Zelenskyy, top U.S. officials to make case for Ukraine funding U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin attend a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in Kyiv, Ukraine April 24, 2022. Picture taken April 24, 2022. Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelenskyy and top aides to U.S. President Joe Biden will make their case to U.S. senators on Tuesday about why a fresh infusion of military assistance is needed to help Ukraine repel Russian invaders. U.S. officials say the United States will spend all it has available for Ukraine by the end of the year, a dire prediction that comes as Kyiv has struggled to make major advances in its 2023 counteroffensive against Russia. Biden's administration in October asked Congress for nearly $106 billion to pay for ambitious plans for Ukraine, Israel and U.S. border security, but Republicans who control the House with a slim majority rejected the package. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a close Biden ally, announced on Monday night that the administration has invited Zelenskyy to address senators via secure video as part of a classified briefing on Tuesday ""so we can hear directly from him precisely what's at stake in this vote."" In addition, a variety of top Biden officials, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, are expected to brief the senators on Tuesday. Zelenskyy told Reuters in a November interview that despite the slow going, Ukraine would try to deliver battlefield results by the end of the year and that he remained sure Kyiv would eventually have success in the war despite difficulties at the front. But the stalled drive to get U.S. assistance has alarmed the Biden White House, which fears a failure to help Ukraine further would increase the likelihood of Russian victories.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told a Swiss media outlet that he agreed with a recent assessment made by the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny that the war had ""reached a stalemate."" Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko holds the remains of a Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile at an exhibition showing the remains of missiles and drones that Russia used to attack Kyiv, on May 12, 2023, in Kyiv, Ukraine. Zaluzhny told The Economist magazine last month that the conflict had ""reached a stalemate"" and a ""deep and beautiful breakthrough"" looked increasingly unlikely. The comments reportedly caused controversy between the military chief and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who disputed the characterization of the state of the war. Speaking to Swiss publication 20 Minuten over the weekend, Kyiv Mayor Klitschko said Zaluzhny had ""told the truth."" ""Some may not want to hear the truth [but] we can't lie to our people and partners indefinitely,"" he said. Klitschko also criticized Zelenskyy, saying the president's popularity had declined because ""people see who is effective and who is not. And there were and are many expectations. Zelenskyy is paying for the mistakes he made,"" he said. When asked what mistakes Zelenskyy had made, Klitschko said Ukraine had not been prepared for the war. ""People wonder why we weren't better prepared for this war. Why Zelenskyy denied until the end that it would happen. Or why it was possible that the Russians were able to reach Kyiv so quickly,"" he said. Despite the criticism, Klitschko said the president ""has an important function today and we must support him until the end of the war. But at the end of this war, every politician will pay for his successes or failures."" The criticism of Zelenskyy comes amid questions about the 2024 election in Ukraine. The president and his advisors have rebuffed the notion of holding a vote when the war is ongoing (and elections are prohibited during times of war in Ukraine) but Kyiv wants to burnish its democratic credentials as it looks to join Western blocs, such as the EU.

Putin to visit Saudi Arabia and the UAE on Wednesday; receive Iran's president on Thursday Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) and Saudi Arabia's Prince and Defence Minister Mohammad bin Salman al Saud (L) attend bilateral talks at the G20 Osaka Summit 2019 on June 29, 2019. Russian President Vladimir Putin will on Wednesday visit Middle East allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, before receiving Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Moscow the day after. The Kremlin announced the scheduled meetings, according Reuters and Google-translated comments reported by Russian state news agency Tass on Telegram. Putin previously visited Saudi Arabia and the UAE in October 2019, according to Tass. It is unclear if the Russian leader will formally attend the U.N.'s COP28 climate conference, which is taking place in major UAE hub Dubai until Dec. 12. Putin has been selective in his foreign travel since the March issuance of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over his alleged responsibility for the unlawful deportation and transfer of children during Moscow's war in Ukraine. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have yet to ratify the Rome Statute that defines the ICC's purview. The Kremlin specified that Putin's engagements in Saudi Arabia and the UAE will discuss topics including the oil market and the Israel-Hamas conflict. Moscow, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Tehran are policy-setting partners in the OPEC+ oil producers' alliance, and Putin's visit comes amid an ongoing slump in oil prices that the Thursday announcement of a spate of voluntary supply cuts have so far failed to resuscitate. The three Middle Eastern countries were also invited to join the Russia and China-led BRICS bloc of emerging markets in August. Initially more restrained in its criticism of Israel, Russia has since joined the three Middle Eastern countries in expressing concern over casualties in the Gaza Strip throughout the Israel-Hamas conflict. Iran outright sponsors the Palestinian militant group, but denied involvement in its terror attacks of Oct. 7.

Around 300,000 Russian personnel likely wounded or killed in war, UK says Britain's Ministry of Defense estimated that official Russian Ministry of Defense forces have likely suffered between 180,000 and 240,000 personnel wounded and approximately 50,000 killed since the start of the war in February 2022. Mercenaries fighting within the private military company known as the Wagner Group have likely suffered approximately 40,000 wounded and 20,000 killed, it added in an intelligence update Monday. ""Therefore, overall, the Russian side has likely suffered around 220,000-280,000 wounded and approximately 70,000 killed,"" the ministry said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Ukrainian forensics experts examine the body of a Russian soldier exhumed in the village of Zavalivka, west of Kyiv, in a refrigerated rail car stacked with the Russian dead on May 11, 2022. ""This gives an estimated range of between 290,000 and 350,000 total Russian combatant casualties."" The median of the estimate range is 320,000 total Russian combatant casualties, it noted. ""Even amongst Russian officials there is likely a low level of understanding about total casualty figures because of a long-established culture of dishonest reporting within the military."" Accurate casualty numbers are impossible to obtain given the chaotic nature of the war and secrecy on both sides over the number of personnel they have lost, respectively.

Radev said parliamentarians did not fully understand the specifics of the donation, and that the vehicles could play a role in safeguarding Bulgaria's borders and aiding its own citizens in emergencies, according to Novinite. He also said that recent floods that required military support showed the need for increasing, rather than reducing domestic supplies. The agreement will now return to parliament for further debate. It comes as Ukrainian officials stress their need for reinforcements amid struggles to make progress in occupied areas, and as frontline fighting progresses into winter. The White House on Monday warned that the U.S. will no longer be able to provide additional military equipment to Ukraine by the end of the year, unless Congress approves further funding. There are also rumblings of discontent over support for Ukraine within the European Union. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has threatened to block all EU funding for Ukraine unless the coalition holds a review of its strategy, while Slovakia's new Prime Minister Robert Fico has suspended the provision of all military aid.

White House says Ukraine funding will run out soon without congressional approval Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Shalanda Young speaks at the daily press briefing at the White House on September 29, 2023 in Washington, DC. A senior White House official on Monday warned that the U.S. would run out of resources to supply Ukraine with more weapons and equipment by the end of the year unless Congress approves additional funding. ""There is no magical pot of funding available to meet this moment. We are out of money—and nearly out of time,"" Shalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a letter to congressional leaders. Young said cutting off U.S. supplies would ""kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield,"" risk it losing gains already made and increase the likelihood of Russian military victories. U.S. packages of security assistance and aid deliveries have already become smaller, she said. Congress has so far approved $111 billion in supplemental funding for Ukraine, by far the largest such support of all Ukraine's allies, but the issue has become increasingly contentious in the U.S. legislature. President Joe Biden has expressed staunch support for Ukraine and the continuation of U.S. support, and in October the White House requested more than $105 billion from Congress for security needs across Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the U.S. southern border. Young said Monday that support for Ukraine would advance domestic national security interests by preventing larger conflict in the region that could involve NATO and U.S. forces, and by deterring future aggression.

Russia trying to capture Avdiivka 'at any cost,' Ukrainian official says A view of Ukraine's Avdiivka city as an airstrike on the Metinvest coke plant is seen in the background on Oct. 30, 2023. Russian forces have launched new fronts in the fierce battle for Avdiivka in the Donetsk region, an Ukrainian official noted. ""The current third wave of enemy assaults differs from the previous two in that they have conditionally opened two new directions,"" the head of Avdiivka's military administration, Vitaliy Barabash said. ""The launching of new directions proves that the enemy has been given a command to capture the city at any cost."" In comments to state media, Barabash said these latest events were an attempt to distract Ukrainian defences and close a gap west of the town that would see it entirely encircled. Independent military analysts have said that about 1,300 civilians remain in the town, which was once home to about 30,000 people. The industrial town in eastern Ukraine has been under constant Russian fire in a bid by Moscow to capture it. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of assaulting Avdiivka, in the eastern Donetsk region, from two new directions, AFP reported."

Cyprus, the closest European Union member state to the Middle East, has offered to host and operate facilities for sustained aid directly into the Gaza Strip once hostilities between Israel and Hamas cease.

Christodoulides planned to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and King Abdullah of Jordan. There were ""technical discussions"" on the matter between Cypriot and Israeli officials on Sunday.

The Cypriot plan is aimed at expanding capacity for humanitarian relief directly to the coastal Gaza Strip beyond limited deliveries being made through the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Palestinian enclave.

Such an aid corridor faces logistical, political and security challenges - Gaza has no port and its waters are shallow.

Britain, which sent 80 tonnes of Gaza-destined aid in the form of mostly blankets and tents to Cyprus last week, has offered watercraft able to access the coastline without the need for special infrastructure if the corridor ever materialises, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

As many as 80 percent of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes in an Israeli bombing campaign that has reduced much of the crowded coastal strip to a desolate wasteland."

Ukraine signaled Monday that it is shifting its military tactics toward a more defensive footing after an analysis of Russia's resource capabilities and as winter approaches.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak noted Monday that ""on the front line and in the cities, we are already moving to a different tactic of warfare — effective defense in certain areas, continuation of offensive operations in other areas, special strategic operations on the Crimean peninsula and in the Black Sea waters, and significantly reformatted missile defense of critical infrastructure.""

Resources will be directed to increasing domestic arms production, he said, and speeding up negotiations with allies to increase equipment supplies for the ""new stage"" of Ukraine's offensive operations, he said.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that winter ""as a whole is a new phase of war,"" with freezing temperatures making fighting far more difficult and the defense of critical energy infrastructure far more of a priority. Zelenskyy also signaled last week that the fortification of all front lines needed to be accelerated.

The shift has prompted some analysts to question whether the change reflects that Ukraine's counteroffensive, launched back in June but failing to make as much progress as hoped, is over.

Eurasia Group founder and president Ian Bremmer commented Monday that ""Ukrainians have shifted to building defensive fortifications, putting an end to the failed counteroffensive."" Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted Saturday that ""poor weather conditions continue to slow the pace of Ukrainian and Russian combat operations across the entire frontline but have not completely halted them.""

Britain to continue supporting Ukraine 'for as long as it takes': Foreign secretary

British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Tuesday that the country would continue its support for Ukraine.

""We will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" he told the House of Lords during a monthly question session. Since February 2022 the U.K. has committed to economic and humanitarian support worth more than £4.7 billion ($5.9 billion) to Ukraine, Cameron noted.

Cameron also said the level of support for Ukraine would remain the same, or even be enhanced, going forward.

Over recent weeks Russian forces have made ""creeping advances"" through the ruins of Marinka, a front line town in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the U.K.'s defense ministry noted Tuesday.

""Russia now likely controls most of the built-up area. However, Ukrainian forces remain in control of pockets of territory on the western edge of the town,"" the ministry said on X, formerly known as Twitter.

""Marinka has been on the front line since 2014. With a pre-war population of 9000, it is comprehensively ruined – drone footage suggests that the vast majority of buildings have been reduced to rubble,"" the ministry added.

Russia's renewed efforts against Marinka are part of its recent offensive in which it is ""prioritising extending Russia's control over the remaining parts of the Donetsk Oblast [region] – highly likely still one of the Kremlin's core war aims,"" the U.K. said.

Finland could soon produce a ""significant"" amount of artillery ammunition for Ukraine, according to the country's Defense Minister Antti Häkkänen.

""The plans are ready ... to increase ammunition production in a significant way,"" he said in a Google-translated interview with the Iltalehti newspaper, adding that ""the purpose is to support Ukraine even more strongly than now.""

Häkkänen said that a decision on production would be made ""very soon, probably before Christmas.""

Finland was the latest country to join the Western military alliance NATO earlier this year, ending decades of military non-alignment.

Helsinki approved its 20th military aid package, worth around 100 million euros ($108.1 million) for Ukraine in November. It brings the total amount of aid provided to Kyiv to around 1.5 billion euros.

Ukraine's military shot down 10 out of 17 attack drones launched overnight by Russia, Ukrainian authorities said on Tuesday.

The governor of Ukraine's western Lviv region said three drones had struck an unspecified infrastructure target, but damage had been minimal and no casualties had been reported.

Authorities in eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region said drones had struck private homes and residential buildings, among other civilian targets, in at least two different settlements.

Kyiv's air force said the drones were shot down over ""various regions"" of the country.

It said six S-300 missiles had also been launched at civilian targets in the eastern Donetsk and southern Kherson regions.

Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in Ukraine, but says the country's energy infrastructure is a legitimate military target.

Ukraine is changing its strategic tactics, presidential aide says

Ukraine is shifting its military tactics as a result of the arrival of winter and an analysis of Russia's resource capabilities, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Monday.

Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Podolyak said: ""On the frontline and in the cities, we are already moving to a different tactic of warfare - effective defense in certain areas, continuation of offensive operations in other areas, special strategic operations on the Crimean peninsula and in the Black Sea waters, and significantly reformatted missile defense of critical infrastructure.""

Resources will be directed to increasing domestic arms production and speeding up negotiations with allies to increase equipment supplies for the ""new stage"" of Ukraine's offensive operations, he said, particularly missile defense systems, long-range missiles, drones, and electronic warfare systems.

Russia has increasingly focused on drones this year, Podolyak added.

This year has also seen numerous reports of drones being shot down by Russia.

Russian forces have launched new fronts in the fierce battle for Avdiivka in the Donetsk region, an Ukrainian official noted.

""The current third wave of enemy assaults differs from the previous two in that they have conditionally opened two new directions,"" the head of Avdiivka's military administration, Vitaliy Barabash said. ""The launching of new directions proves that the enemy has been given a command to capture the city at any cost.""

In comments to state media, Barabash said these latest events were an attempt to distract Ukrainian defences and close a gap west of the town that would see it entirely encircled. Independent military analysts have said that about 1,300 civilians remain in the town, which was once home to about 30,000 people.

The industrial town in eastern Ukraine has been under constant Russian fire in a bid by Moscow to capture it. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of assaulting Avdiivka, in the eastern Donetsk region, from two new directions, AFP reported.

By Lisa Zengarini and Marine Henriot - Dubai

After the opening four days, which saw Pope Francis add his authoritative voice to urge world leaders not to postpone climate action for any longer, COP28 gets into full swing this week to discuss the key issues to address the climate crisis.

Negotiators are debating the hot-button question of moving away from fossil energy sources to contain global warming within the 1.5 degrees Celsius increase agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement, with a view to adopting a final text by the end of the COP28 scheduled for December 12.



Climate scientists say that surpassing 1.5 °C will expose the planet to more frequent and intense extreme weather events with devastating effects on the livelihood of millions of people across the world, especially in the most vulnerable countries in the Global South, as we are already witnessing today.

The COP28 final text, which is to be adopted unanimously, will set the course for the climate policy actions for the 197 States plus the European Union signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to meet the long-term 2015 Paris Agreement goals. It will inform the new commitments that countries must submit by 2025.

According to the first global Stocktake Report on the implementation of the climate landmark agreement published in September ahead of COP28, actions carried out so far by countries are insufficient to limit the global temperature rise to within 2 °C of pre-industrial levels. The report’s technical findings showed that much more is needed by all actors both from the public and private sector.

Leaders will base their discussions in Dubai on a document prepared by the United Kingdom and Singapore, which says countries must prepare a “reduction/exit from fossil fuels.""



Wording of the text 'crucial'

The wording of the text is crucial, as confirmed to Vatican News’ Marine Henriot by Lola Vallejo, Airector of the climate programme at the Institute for Sustainable Development and international relations (IDDRI).

Developing countries, alongside many faith-based organizations and civil society groups, are pressing for full “phaseout” (exit) of coal, oil and gas which are the primary drivers of climate change.

Fossil-producing countries, on the other hand, are proposing ""phasedown"" (reduction) or phaseout of only of ""unabated fossil fuels"", i.e., those burned without using technology to capture their planet-warming emissions



Phaseout vs. phasedown

Ms. Vallejo said that that the difference between “reduction” (phasedown) and “exit” (phaseout) from fossil fuels, “would be a signal sent to the markets and all the business community showing that the era of fossil fuels is coming to an end, and that we are in the process of moving to a new energy system in which we will place much more emphasis on energy efficiency, and on renewable energies in particular”.



New technologies to capture planet-warming emissions not a miracle solution

Regarding carbon-capture-and-sequestration technologies to mitigate the issue of CO2 emissions she remarked that, though we need these new technologies to compensate for emissions that are particularly difficult to decarbonize - for example in the heavy industry sector - they “are limited and costly” and, therefore, cannot be considered as a “miracle solution.”

Ms. Vallejo also cautioned on the “the risk of giving the impression that we will be able to deploy this technology on a massive scale, for example on power plants which would continue to operate with coal or gas, to ultimately continue to use fossils and expand their lifespan well beyond the recommendations given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).”





Ms. Vallejo further reiterated the importance of the key issue of investing in adaptation, that is preparing for the impacts of global warming, both of those which are already there, and those those to come, including building energy-saving houses. 



Loss and Damage Fund will need substantial funding from richer countries

A major achievement in the first days of COP-28 was the finalization of the Loss and Damage Fund to supply developing countries with recovery funds in response to the effects of climate disasters. In this regard Ms Vallejo confirmed that this undoubtedly a great victory for poorer nations who have been fighting for a climate loss and damage mechanism for years. However she pointed out that its concrete functioning and funding from wealthier nations in the coming years still remain an open question.--Vatican News"

1144387458,20231205,"MOGADISHU, Somalia - The Somali Coast Guard officers have arrested suspected pirates along the Puntland coastline, just a few days after the US Marine Corps apprehended five others who had tried to hijack a vessel within the Gulf of Aden, leading to increased surveillance in the area.

According to Africa Defence Magazine, the pirates who hijacked an Iranian fishing boat surrendered to Somali officers after they were monitored by European Union Operation Atalanta assets.

On 22 November, the European Union Naval Force [EU Navfor] Joint Operations Centre was alerted by the Commander of the Somali Coast Guard about the abduction of an Iranian-flagged fishing dhow off the coast of Eyl [Puntland, Somalia], the Defense Magazine reports.

Initial reports indicate that the pirates are believed to have come from a local clan whose intention of hijacking the vessel is said to be their concern that Somali waters were being misused by foreign vessels without permission from the government.

Further reports indicate that the Somali pirates were demanding $ 400,000 for the release of the Al-Meraj I and its crew. Reports added that they threatened to use the vessel to attack more shipping if the ransom was not paid.

From the 22nd on, Operation Atalanta monitored the Al-Meraj I closely for more than 230 nautical miles away from the coast of Somalia, contributing to preventing the alleged pirates from posing any threat, EU Navfor said in a statement.

It added the operation included the deployment of an unarmed ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle from an Operation Atalanta warship. It is thought the vessel was not boarded because authorities were not sure if hostages were on board.

The Al-Meraj I, after losing its two towed skiffs and in poor weather, turned back towards the coast of Puntland and its crew surrendered to Somali police. This points to good cooperation between the EU Navfor task force, and the Somali authorities and stresses the relevance of the EU presence as continually contributing to freedom of navigation in waters where pirates once ran riot, the EU Navfor said on 1 December.

“Many of these Somali forces have participated in training exercises with EU Navfor warships, in cooperation with the EU Capacity Building Mission in Somalia [EUCAP Somalia]. The acquired knowledge and mutual trust ensured an effective and safe transfer,” EU Navfor added.

Piracy had been a major problem in Somali waters until around 2014 when many countries started deploying security teams to guard vessels. With the Al-Shabaab menace in Somalia and restlessness in Yemen, the cases have started spiraling in recent weeks along the Indian Ocean."

1144390398,20231205,"Singapore government on Tuesday announced its updated national AI strategy, dubbed the National AI Strategy (NAIS) 2.0, as AI technology development gains momentum across the globe.

The new policy introduces three major changes. The first key policy shift is that Singapore now believes that AI is a necessity and no longer “good to have.” In this context, it aims to triple the talent pool of AI experts to 15,000 by training and hiring people, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said while launching NAIS 2.0.

As the technology continues to progress, AI professionals and data scientists are in high demand in all geographies, so the country plans to train people and hire from overseas markets to gain an edge.

The second policy change is that the country now harbors global ambitions and aims to make a significant contribution to AI breakthroughs at a global level.

The third significant change is to adopt a projects-to-systems approach. “We will take a systems approach, bringing together stakeholders within and outside Singapore to add to our resources, capabilities, and infrastructure, accelerate the exchange of ideas, and administer AI-enabled solutions at scale,” the new policy document read.

Singapore was one of the first countries to come up with a National AI Strategy in 2019 and the country committed an investment of about $373 million (S$500 million) through AI Singapore (AISG) for the Research, Innovation, and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 and 2025 plans. However, the recent advances in AI technology, with the advent of generative AI, demanded a relook at the existing policies, which led to the launch of NAIS 2.0.

NAIS 2.0 defines excellence and empowerment as the twin goals of the policy. The country hopes to excel in AI to “maximize value creation” by empowering people and businesses to use the technology with confidence.

It further defines ten enablers in three categories of activity drivers (industry, Government, and research), people and communities (talent, capabilities, and placemaking), and infrastructure and environment (compute, data, trusted environment, and leader in thought and action).

The launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI last year put the technology in the spotlight and brought forth the transformative impact it will have on various industry verticals.

Several countries, including the US and the UK, are formulating policies to leverage AI for social and economic gains while at the same time trying to find the best way to address questions around data access, privacy, and accountability, among others.

The European Union (EU) is also in the process of working on the AI Act to regulate the technology so it can be leveraged for social and economic benefits while addressing the risks associated with it.

Possibly the most significant development in this regard is the signing of the Bletchley Declaration by 28 countries and the EU earlier this year. This is a significant step as it brings several countries together to work on shared objectives and to address the risks associated with the technology."

The Stoke-on-Trent North MP said the former Ukip and Brexit Party leader would ""take no prisoners"". Mr Gullis, who co-founded the right-wing New Conservatives group, suggested Mr Farage could be made a peer like Lord David Cameron who made a sensational comeback as Foreign Secretary. The Red Wall MP told GB News: ""We can't allow 300,000 plus net migration, we do need to actually deliver on the tens of thousands.

""We've now got Lord Cameron as Foreign Secretary so I've got no issue with Lord Farage as Home Secretary in the future or in any other department if that would be the easiest way to get him into government quicker. “I think he would take no nonsense, he would take no prisoners. ""He would call out the Civil Service for what they are at times, which are blockers to actual government policy, and make sure that we deliver on the priorities of the British public."" Mr Gullis's comments come as the Tories are under intense pressure to get a grip on both legal and illegal migration. Home Secretary James Cleverly yesterday set out a five-point plan to slash net migration to the UK after official estimates showed figures hit a peak of 745,000 in 2022.

During his trip to Cop28 in Dubai, Rishi Sunak suggested Mr Farage would be welcome in the Conservative Party. The Prime Minister said: “Our party has always been a broad church but my focus is consistently on delivering on the things that matter to people.” Mr Farage left the Conservatives in 1992 over the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, which laid the foundations for the European Union. He has since founded Ukip and the Brexit Party and is now a GB News presenter. But Mr Farage is said to be eyeing a political return after his stint on ITV reality show I'm A Celebrity...

He made the statement in advance of a conference on ""how to stop the radicalization in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict"" and the road to long-lasting peace, which will be held on Wednesday in the European Parliament in Brussels. Hundreds of parliamentarians from European countries are expected to attend, alongside Christian leaders and NGO representatives.

The conference is spearheaded by IAF Europe and MPs Bert-Jan Ruissen and Cristian Terheș. Knesset Christian Allies Caucus Co-Chair Sharren Haskel will be the keynote speaker.

""The violent extremism and radicalization we are seeing begins in the Palestinian education system,"" Haskel said. ""October 7 terrorists were bred on a deep hatred for the Jewish People from as early as their kindergarten days.

""If the European Union continues to fund this kind of education and the salaries of those who disseminate it, there is, tragically, no solution to ending terror,"" she said. ""A new level of scrutiny must be applied to the EU's aid to the Palestinian Authority.""

In September, the Georg Eckert Institute, in a study commissioned by the European Commission, uncovered instances of antisemitic content in Palestinian schoolbooks – as was found in other studies in previous years. The European Parliament has on several occasions called on the commission to make EU funding to the Palestinian Authority conditional on textbooks being free from antisemitism and hate. However, funding has persisted, as has the antisemitic content and even incitement to violence.

Van Doesburg said the EU should compel the PA to discontinue its pay-for-slay program that offers subsidies to convicted terrorists or their families and formulate a ""comprehensive strategy to counteract indoctrination and combat the dissemination of antisemitism fueled by the Palestinian Authority in Judea and Samaria, as well as its spread in Europe.""

The conference will deal with these specific issues, according to MEP Ruissen and more broadly with how to ""halt radicalization by taking away the breeding grounds for radicalization both in Palestinian territories as well as in the EU.""

He said: ""Radicalization is a looming danger, both in the Middle East and Europe. It is often invisible until it suddenly comes to the surface and confronts many. The atrocities committed on October 7 are a terrifying example of what radicalization can lead to.""

The IAF works to empower pro-Israel, faith-based legislators worldwide. It coordinates 52 Israel Allies Caucuses in addition to the EU caucus. In 2022, IAF Europe opened a new office in the Netherlands to extend the IAF network and to empower IAF chairpersons from European countries and the European Parliament."

EG12014, a biosimilar of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech), has received a marketing authorization from the European Commission (EC) for use in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast and metastatic gastric cancer; these are the same indications that trastuzumab holds in the European Union.1

EirGenix Inc, the manufacturer of EG12014, and its commercial partner Sandoz plan to commercialize intravenous (IV) EG12014 at a dose of 150 mg. Under a licensing agreement signed in April 2019, EirGenix will handle the development and manufacturing of trastuzumab and Sandoz will hold the rights to commercialize the medicine upon approval in the global market, outside of Taiwan, China, Russia, and other Asian countries.1

In May 2017, EirGenix announced that EG12014 met the primary end point of bioequivalence in a phase 1 study (NCT03180242) compared with trastuzumab sourced from the European Union and the United States.2

The double-blind, parallel group, 3-arm study enrolled 84 healthy male Caucasian patients and was conducted in Europe. Patients were 18 to 55 years of age and were required to be nonsmokers or ex-smokers, have a body mass index ranging from 18.5 to 30.0 kg/m2, and have a body weight of 105.0 kg or less. Patients were randomly assigned to receive EG12014, trastuzumab from the United States, or trastuzumab from the European Union, all of which were given via intravenous infusion at a single dose of 6 mg/kg over 90 minutes. The primary end point was area under the concentration/time curve; secondary end points were peak plasma concentration, adverse effects (AEs), and serum concentration half-life.3

In March 2021, EirGenix reported positive findings from a phase 3 study (NCT03433313) comparing the safety and efficacy of EG12014 vs trastuzumab in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. This trial met its primary end point, demonstrating that treatment with EG12014 produced a similar pathological complete response (pCR) rate to that of trastuzumab. Additionally, the safety profile of the biosimilar was comparable to that of the reference drug.4,5

The multicenter, double-blind trial enrolled 807 female patients and randomly assigned them 1:1 to receive anthracycline/paclitaxel alongside either neoadjuvant EG12014 or trastuzumab. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy was administered once every 3 weeks during cycles 1 through 4. Patients were then treated with EG12014 or trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel at ongoing doses of 6 mg/kg following an 8-mg/kg loading dose. This regimen was administered once every 3 weeks for 12 weeks during cycles 5 to 8.4,5

All patients were scheduled for tumor removal surgery 3 to 6 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant treatment. Within 2 to 6 weeks after surgery, eligible patients received adjuvant EG12014 or trastuzumab for a maximum of 13 cycles, for 12 months of overall trastuzumab treatment. A long-term safety follow-up spanning 20 weeks was conducted after administration of the final dose.4

The primary end point was pCR at the time of surgery. Secondary end points included event-free survival, overall response rate, overall survival, AEs, and trastuzumab serum concentration.5

EG12014 150-mg lyophilized powder for injection also received market approval from the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration in June 2023. The National Health Insurance Administration under the Ministry of Health and Welfare approved the application of the health insurance pricing in September 2023, leading to the formal launch of EG12014 in Taiwan.1

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson spoke to reporters about the rising threat following a fatal terrorist knife attack near the Eiffel Tower over the weekend.

""With the war between Israel and Hamas, and the polarization it causes in our society, with the upcoming holiday season, there is a huge risk of terrorist attacks in the European Union,"" said Johansson.

FRENCH MINISTER WARNS COUNTRY 'DURABLY UNDER THREAT FROM ISLAMIST TERRORISM' AFTER PARIS STABBING SUSPECT ID'D

""We saw [it happening] recently in Paris,"" she added. ""Unfortunately, we have seen it earlier as well.""

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin reportedly told TF1 television on Sunday that the country was ""durably under threat from Islamist terrorism"" after a prosecutor identified the French 26-year-old born to Iranian parents accused of fatally stabbing a German tourist and injuring two others steps away from the Eiffel Tower in Paris over the weekend.

At a news conference on Sunday, France's top anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said suspect Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab, a French national, recorded a video speaking in Arabic before the attack in which he swore allegiance to the Islamic State group.

He used a name to introduce himself that referred to the Islamic State in Afghanistan and expressed support for Islamic extremists and jihadists operating in various areas around the world, including in Africa, Iraq, Syria, Egypt's Sinai, Yemen, Iran and Pakistan.

German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser expressed deep concern about the heightened risk of Islamic terrorism in continental Europe.

""Our security agencies are working very closely together. We must keep a particularly close eye on the Islamist threats right now and take action against Islamist propaganda together with neighboring countries,"" said Faeser.

1144433596,20231205,"France has imposed sanctions against a senior official with the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas, amid Israel’s devastating war waged on the blockaded Gaza Strip.

Media report said on Tuesday that the French measures would freeze assets belonging to Hamas Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar.

He is the latest leader from the resistance group to be added to Western sanctions list. France on Nov. 13 imposed sanctions at a national level on Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif and his deputy, Marwan Issa.

Paris is working with partners to impose sanctions on Hamas individuals and its financing network at the European Union level.

Several EU states in recent weeks have come under pressure from the US and Israel to impose new sanctions on the Palestinian resistance group. Germany, France and Italy have proposed new sanctions in a so-called non-paper (a non-official EU document).

In the three-page document, dated November 9, they write that “it is important to step up engagement to isolate Hamas internationally and delegitimize narrative of Hamas as ‘defender of the (just) Palestinian cause.'”

The document adds that “once political conditions are right,” these new measures should ideally be implemented by a broad coalition of states.

The aim is to deprive Hamas of resources, as well as target its infrastructure inside and outside Gaza and its political and public standing.

France wants the European Union to impose sanctions against top Hamas leaders following the Palestinian group's operation al-Aqsa Storm.

France ""is pushing for sanctions at the European level against senior Hamas figures, individually, because for the moment ... the European Union only condemns the organization as a whole,"" Laurence Boone, secretary of state for European affairs, earlier said on the sidelines of an international meeting in Madrid.

The idea would be to ""specifically target certain individuals"" with ""mainly financial"" sanctions such as an asset freeze, she added without specifying who should be targeted.

France's proposal could be adopted by EU foreign ministers in December, Boone said. It has the backing of Germany and Italy, according to her entourage.

The United States in October imposed sanctions against 10 ""key"" members of Hamas based in Gaza, Sudan, Turkey, Algeria and Qatar.

Among the general public, opinion polls show most Americans and Europeans back an end to Israel’s war in the besieged enclave.

In recent weeks, senior Western officials have said they wouldn’t be drawing any red lines for Israel, which has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians during a yet-ongoing war against the Gaza Strip.

So far this year, the US and its European allies have provided Israel with at least several types of weapons. However, the type and number of weapons are not publicly known due to secrecy about the shipments.

Experts have said these Western weapons are likely being used extensively by Israeli forces against Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel is the single largest recipient of US and European foreign aid since World War II.

Two months into Israel's genocidal onslaught on Gaza, the regime continues with its air assault and ground operation in the besieged Palestinian territory.

At least 25 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli bombings over the past few hours.

Civilian structures including schools, hospitals and mosques have also been targeted.

Gaza health officials say the regime is now encircling Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza with tanks.

They say snipers are shooting at anyone moving in the area. In the south, the regime dropped leaflets, telling Palestinians to flee to other areas.

Residents on the ground say the intense Israeli airstrikes in the south include areas where Israel had earlier told people to seek shelter.

Israel has sent dozens of tanks into southern Gaza as the regime expands its ground offensive into the blockaded territory. Israeli military officials claim they are in pursuit of Hamas members in their Gaza operation.

Since the start of the war on October 7, nearly 16,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,000 children, were killed by Israeli aggression during the past two months. Many more are feared to be buried under the rubble."

This year’s theme is Soil and Water: a source of life.

Minister McConalogue commented: “There is a precious link between soil and water and with over 95% of our food originating from the soil, and the relationship with water is the foundation of our agricultural production.”

In addition, Minister McConalogue announced that approval letters for phase two of the Soil Sampling and Analysis Programme will issue to 7,000 farmers this week. This Programme will provide valuable information to farmers to inform decisions that promote the health of their soils and is aimed at putting soil health, soil fertility and soil carbon at the very centre of our future agricultural model.

Minister McConalogue said: “I am delighted to see progress with the programme and I wish our new partner the Irish Soil Expert Consortium well in the delivery of the sampling, analysis and provision of approximately 90,000 soil sample results to our farmers.” To mark World Soil Day, Minister of State Pippa Hackett recently took the opportunity to visit Thomas, Florence and David Fennelly’s farm near Emo, Co. Laois.

The Fennelly’s are dairy farmers participating in the Teagasc Signpost programme and are carrying out activities to reduce the GHG and ammonia emissions, to improve water quality, soil health and the overall biodiversity on their farm.

Minister Hackett said: “I was delighted to hear what the Fennelly’s are doing to make their farm more sustainable. Their focus on implementing sustainable soil management practices and improving soil health on their farm is evident. Healthy soils play a crucial role in regulating water retention and availability in agriculture.”

Minister Hackett added: “The health of the soil, and the quality and availability of water are interconnected. Both are an integral and necessary part of our lives and I welcome that World Soil Day is highlighting this important interconnection.”

Minister of State Martin Heydon stated: “At the recent ‘Agriculture and Climate Change: Science into Action’ conference hosted by my Department, I announced funding of €3.8m for four research projects arising from the 2023 Ireland – New Zealand Joint Research Call. One of these projects is examining the implications of land management practices on organic peat soils with a particular emphasis on greenhouse gas emission reductions and will receive just over €1 million.”

Minister Heydon also used the occasion of World Soil Day to announce the signing of the European Soil Mission Manifesto. The Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme 2021-2027 is the European Union’s key initiative for funding research and one of its five missions is the ‘Soil Deal for Europe’. The Soil Mission Manifesto highlights the urgent need for action to protect soil health and the signing of the manifesto is an important element in the success of Soil Mission.

Marking his signing of the Manifesto, Minister Heydon said: “Food Vision 2030 highlights that good soil health is critical in terms of agricultural output, producing nutrient-dense food, sequestering carbon, supporting habitats and biodiversity, and building resilience against climate change. The Soil Mission will enable research in these areas, and I am delighted to sign the Soil Mission Manifesto on this World Soil Day and believe it is an important demonstration of my Department’s commitment to the Soil Mission.”

The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine supports the stated ambition of World Soil Day of raising awareness of the importance of maintaining healthy ecosystems and human well-being by addressing the growing challenges in soil management, increasing soil awareness and encouraging societies to improve soil health."

Risto Uuk is European Union research lead at the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit focused on technology risks.

This week European Union institutions will enter into crucial negotiations over the fate of the Artificial Intelligence Act. The legislation has been pending since 2019 and has the potential to set global rules for AI, given the EU’s economic weight and the slow pace of regulation in other crucial markets. But at this late hour, the governments of France and Germany are proposing a regulatory compromise that would give the developers of powerful, adaptable foundation models a free hand in service of European AI “sovereignty.”

This notion ignores basic economics. Foundation models form the fundamental building blocks for various AI applications, and their developers in Europe promise that gutting the AI Act will allow them to catch up to the big players on the world stage. The catch-up most likely won’t happen, but the watering down of the regulation will have real effects in reducing the ability of European policy makers to protect their citizens from harm.

Dispassionate economic analysis tells a much fuller story than appeals to national pride. In reality, the most capable foundation models are already well-positioned to become natural monopolies, making the need for regulation even more dire. Many factors will determine whether Europe can begin producing foundation models of the same caliber as its U.S. rivals. Refraining from imposing any safety obligations on these developers is not one of them.

There are three main costs that go into building foundation models, and that developers and European policy makers need to pay attention to: the fixed costs associated with model training, the additional costs linked to customizing the model for individual clients, and the variable cost attached to actually operating the model.

Training foundation models is expensive. The fixed costs largely stem from acquiring enough computational power for pretraining, sourcing training datasets, attracting talent, and other infrastructure expenses. Ultimately, the bill can add up to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, with soaring computational-power prices and competition for key talent forming the largest chunk. For example, training GPT-4 cost an astonishing $100 million, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. As a result of these fixed costs, foundation models exhibit strong economies of scale.

Once foundation models have been trained, they need significantly fewer resources to operate. This means that the biggest players on the world market who can afford to scale up are then able to reap the benefits of much lower average costs. Consequently, we observe significant barriers to entry for new companies, which are plagued by the need to achieve sufficient scale in order to be cost competitive. As such, early entrants into the playing field tend to gain first-mover advantages that make the market hard to challenge.

Acquiring sufficient data poses one of the greatest challenges of the training stage. Currently, the most data-intensive language model is Google’s FLAN, trained on 1.87 trillion words. Foundation models have a voracious need for data, but the public internet only contains around 100 trillion words total, which makes proprietary datasets extremely valuable for maintaining a competitive edge. At the moment, U.S. big tech companies hold this advantage, controlling most data generated online across platforms, searches, emails, images, videos, and other documents. Foundation model providers that want to get their hands on this invaluable proprietary data will face a strong incentive to vertically integrate with incumbents.

Another crucial variable is computational power or “compute,” which, so far, appears to scale along with model performance. To make their models more capable, developers must add ever more compute, but this is costly to acquire, limited in supply, and has technical constraints. To illustrate, Microsoft invested $13 billion in OpenAI, most of which OpenAI used to pay for training compute.

The last key ingredient for becoming a big player in the foundation model market is talent. Currently, demand far exceeds supply for researchers and engineers capable of developing the best foundation models and the necessary server infrastructure. Foundation model producers are even willing to hire engineers without AI experience and train them in-house. A 2021 McKinsey survey found that 32% of organizations reported it “very difficult” to hire AI data scientists. New entrants would likely need to poach talent from market leaders, but workers are unlikely to switch without even more lucrative compensation offers.

These factors are what plague the European foundation model-market—not regulation. Continental European players have not invested as much in compute, data, and talent as incumbents across the Atlantic. Regulation of advanced AI models would not create a competitive disadvantage for European companies since it would apply to all players who produce models above a certain size and capability. If anything, it would hit American AI companies harder than European ones since they are investing in larger models. Furthermore, it may actually be easier for European companies to navigate European regulations than for foreigners. Finally, ensuring that the foundation models produced by the world leaders are safe would empower Europe’s thousands of smaller and medium-sized enterprises, which are building innovative applications on top of these powerful foundation models.

What should policymakers do so that AI development benefits consumers, aside from ensuring the safety of advanced AI models? First, they should aim to ensure contestability for the foundation-model market in Europe. This may mean focusing on merger reviews, any privileged access to models, acquisitions made by foundation-model companies, and the existence of predatory pricing. As a last resort, foundation model companies may need to be broken up.

Data governance rules can also help prevent undesirable concentration in foundation model markets by limiting privacy violations and exclusive data accumulation, especially as models shift from using open web data to proprietary datasets. In addition, authorities should ensure talent can flow freely by discouraging or banning noncompete clauses and scrutinizing other restrictive contract terms. As their economic role grows, the most capable model providers may need to be regulated as public utilities with outsized societal risks.

If Europe wants to benefit from recent advances in AI, it must first impose strong regulations that correspond with European values. This will allow it to harness the productivity benefits of existing foundation models. Ultimately, watering down the AI Act requirements on foundation models would do nothing to improve EU competitiveness and would lower global standards, to everyone’s detriment.

1144442370,20231205,"Stoke-on-Trent MP Jonathan Gullis is backing Nigel Farage to become a future Home Secretary. Tory backbencher Mr Gullis insists the former Ukip and Brexit Party leader would 'take no prisoners'.

Outspoken Mr Gullis, who co-founded the right-wing New Conservatives group, suggested Mr Farage could be made a peer like Lord David Cameron who made a sensational comeback as Foreign Secretary last month, the Express reports.

The Red Wall MP - who represents Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke - told GB News: ""We can't allow 300,000 plus net migration, we do need to actually deliver on the tens of thousands. Maybe, just maybe, the Conservatives could put Nigel Farage in the House of Lords.

""We've now got Lord Cameron as Foreign Secretary so I've got no issue with Lord Farage as Home Secretary in the future or in any other department if that would be the easiest way to get him into government quicker. I think he would take no nonsense, he would take no prisoners.

""He would call out the Civil Service for what they are at times, which are blockers to actual government policy, and make sure that we deliver on the priorities of the British public.""

Mr Gullis's comments come as the Conservatives are under intense pressure to get a grip on both legal and illegal migration. Home Secretary James Cleverly yesterday set out a five-point plan to slash net migration to the UK after official estimates showed figures hit a peak of 745,000 in 2022.

During his trip to Cop28 in Dubai, Rishi Sunak suggested Mr Farage would be welcome in the Conservative Party.

The Prime Minister said: “Our party has always been a broad church but my focus is consistently on delivering on the things that matter to people.”

Mr Farage left the Conservatives in 1992 over the signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, which laid the foundations for the European Union. He has since founded Ukip and the Brexit Party and is now a GB News presenter.

But Mr Farage is said to be eyeing a political return after his stint on ITV reality show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here for a reported £1 million fee.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson spoke to reporters about the rising threat following a fatal terrorist knife attack near the Eiffel Tower over the weekend.

“With the war between Israel and Hamas, and the polarization it causes in our society, with the upcoming holiday season, there is a huge risk of terrorist attacks in the European Union,” said Johansson.

FRENCH MINISTER WARNS COUNTRY ‘DURABLY UNDER THREAT FROM ISLAMIST TERRORISM’ AFTER PARIS STABBING SUSPECT ID’D

“We saw [it happening] recently in Paris,” she added. “Unfortunately, we have seen it earlier as well.”

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin reportedly told TF1 television on Sunday that the country was “durably under threat from Islamist terrorism” after a prosecutor identified the French 26-year-old born to Iranian parents accused of fatally stabbing a German tourist and injuring two others steps away from the Eiffel Tower in Paris over the weekend.

At a news conference on Sunday, France’s top anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said suspect Armand Rajabpour-Miyandoab, a French national, recorded a video speaking in Arabic before the attack in which he swore allegiance to the Islamic State group.

‘PARIS STABBING SUSPECT WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER PREVIOUS ISLAMIC TERROR PLOT: FRENCH MINISTER

He used a name to introduce himself that referred to the Islamic State in Afghanistan and expressed support for Islamic extremists and jihadists operating in various areas around the world, including in Africa, Iraq, Syria, Egypt’s Sinai, Yemen, Iran and Pakistan.

German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser expressed deep concern about the heightened risk of Islamic terrorism in continental Europe.

“Our security agencies are working very closely together. We must keep a particularly close eye on the Islamist threats right now and take action against Islamist propaganda together with neighboring countries,” said Faeser.

Ricard said the suspect had a history of contact via social networks with one of the two men notorious for the gruesome killing of a priest during Mass in 2016 in Saint-Etienne du Rouvray.

He said the suspect was also in touch with the man who killed a police couple at their home in Yvelines, west of Paris, a month earlier.

On Sunday, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne called a special cabinet meeting with key ministers and officials charged with security “to provide a full update on the security arrangements in place, the treatment of the most dangerous individuals and the aftermath of this fatal attack,” her office said, according to The New York Times."

• October exports at $ 899.91 m down by 18% YoY and lowest since $ 849 m in April
• Apparel and textiles, rubber and rubber-based products, coconut and coconut-based products drop due to sluggish demand
• Cumulative merchandise export earnings in first 10 months down 9.58% to $ 9.87 b
• Services exports in January-October up by 67.2% to $ 2.6 b

Exports in October dipped by 18% year-on-year (YoY) to the lowest in five months provisional data released by the EDB revealed, reinforcing private sector concerns on mounting challenges.



 The Sri Lanka Export Development Board (SLEDB) said, October merchandise export performance was $ 899.91 million, down by 17.85% from a year ago. The previous lowest was in April at $ 814.13 million. Sri Lanka saw 2023’s highest export performance in August of $ 1.09 billion though down by 8.7% from a year ago. In comparison to September 2023, the October performance was down by 13%.



 The EDB said the decline in merchandise exports is due to decreased demand for export products, particularly in sectors such as apparel and textiles, rubber and rubber-based products and coconut and coconut-based products.



 From January to October 2023, cumulative merchandise exports saw a substantial decline of 9.58% YoY to $ 9.87 billion compared to the corresponding period of 2022.



 The estimated value of services exports from January to October 2023 was $ 2.6 billion, increasing 67.2% from a year ago. The services exports estimated by EDB consist of ICT/BPM, construction, financial services and transport and logistics.

Despite the original EDB forecast of $ 18.51 billion in merchandise and service exports in 2023 including $ 15.93 billion from merchandise exports and $ 2.58 billion from services exports, the EDB Chairman Dr. Kingsley Bernard said it was very difficult to forecast amid the global headwinds and recession in key markets and adverse impacts of the ongoing wars.



 “We cannot estimate the numbers for the year amid the highly volatile global scenario,” he told the Daily FT.



 Export earnings from food and beverages have increased by 20.77% YoY to $ 36.86 million in October 2023, with a strong performance in exports of Processed food (29.49%).



 Export earnings from seafood increased by 3.73% to $ 20.29 million in October 2023 compared to October 2022. This increase was mainly due to the strong performance in the export of Frozen fish (5.21%) and Fresh fish (13.78%).



 Moreover, export earnings from ornamental fish increased by 35.71% to $ 2.47 million in October 2023 compared to October 2022.

 In addition, export earnings from Rubber and rubber finished products decreased by 11.71% to $ 771.86 million in January – October 2023 compared with the same period of 2022 attributed to lower exports of Industrial and Surgical Gloves of Rubber (-25.59%) and Pneumatic and Retreated Rubber Tyres and Tubes (-4.99%).



 From January to October 2023, export earnings from coconut and coconut-based products decreased by 16.92% to $ 590.69 million from the same period last year. Earnings from all the major categories of coconut products decreased from January to October 2023 compared with the corresponding period of 2022 due to the poor performance in export of coconut oil (-16.28%), desiccated coconut (-26.09%), coconut milk powder (-7.13%), coconut cream (-9.12%), liquid coconut milk (-7.99%), Cocopeat (-17.61%) and activated carbon (-18.98%).



 Further, export earnings from seafood decreased by 5.18% to $ 213.24 million from January to October 2023 compared to the year 2022 due to the poor performance in Frozen Fish (-4.36%), Shrimps (-31.77%) and Crabs (-22.83%).



 Among the top 10 export markets, Italy has shown a strong performance in both the month of October 2023 and the period of January to October 2023 when compared to the corresponding periods in the previous year. Furthermore, UAE and France have shown significant performance from January to October 2023 compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.



 Exports to the US, Sri Lanka’s single largest export destination, decreased 13.84% to $ 206.77 million in October 2023 compared to October 2022. Further, exports to the US decreased by 19.18% to $ 2,281.57 million from January to October 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.



 In October 2023, exports to Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners constituted 6.5% of the total merchandise exports, experiencing a notable 22.27% decrease to reach $ 71.22 million, compared to October 2022. Specifically, both exports to India and Pakistan recorded decreases of 22.18% and 23.30%, respectively, during October 2023 compared to October 2022.



 The negative performance of India was driven by lower exports of petroleum oil (-73.51%) and animal feed (-24.04%), while Pakistan’s negative performance was led by decreased exports of betel leaves.



 From January to October, FTA partners accounted for 7.2% of total merchandise exports decreased by 0.77% to $ 786.09 million compared to a year ago.



 Both exports to India and Pakistan decreased by 0.69% and 1.58% respectively from January to October 2023 when compared with the corresponding period of 2022.



 The negative export performance of India was driven by lower export of Animal feed (4.47%), while Pakistan’s negative performance was led by decreased export of Sheet rubber and other articles of stones.



 Exports to the European Union (EU) which comprised 21% of Sri Lanka’s exports during October 2023 decreased by 23.52% YoY to $ 213.18 million. Further, exports to the European Union (EU) decreased by 12.19% YoY to $ 2,257.58 million from January to October 2023 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.

1144509705,20231206,"Hungarian insect producer Agroloop has chosen Bühler’s sophisticated insect growth system for its industrial black soldier fly plant. The facility will produce up to 4,000 metric tons of animal feed ingredients per year and will be built in Üllő, Hungary. Swiss technology group Bühler will deliver its proven crate-based nursery and rearing technology, which will enable a quick ramp-up of the plant for commercial production. By the end of 2024, Agroloop plans to launch its first products, contributing to a more sustainable animal feed value chain.

Following its foundation in 2017 and the successful operation of a pilot facility, Agroloop got the green light for the implementation of an industrial insect plant in Hungary in 2022. Now they have selected all execution partners and are working at full speed to construct the plant and get it operational. The insect facility will be realized in an existing building of the Aerozone Park in Üllő, which is located next to the Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport. In the new plant Agroloop – supported by Bühler insect technology expertise – will produce more than 25,000 metric tons of black soldier fly larvae that will be turned into sustainable feed ingredients for the pet food, aquaculture, and livestock sector.

The plant is only the first step in Agroloop’s strategy to make insect feed ingredients available for the Central and Eastern European (CEE) agribusiness.

“The abundance of food processing by-products presents a unique opportunity for Agroloop's multi-plant rollout strategy in the CEE region. Leveraging our strategic partnership with the leading regional feed producer UBM Group, we improve feed quality and sustainability creating future-proof feed formulas. This enables Agroloop to focus on rapid expansion and solidifies our position as a key player in the region,” said István Nagy, co-founder and chief executive officer of Agroloop.

Agroloop employs a local engineering company to integrate the various technology packages. The heart of the system is the insect growth technology, which mainly determines the plant yield and has a major effect on business performance. For their insect growth system, Agroloop has selected Bühler’s nursery and rearing technology, which has several years of a track record in the insect industry.

“We’ve meticulously assembled a best-in-class technology supplier portfolio to build our plant. Bühler plays a crucial role in providing the framework and core components for this design. By choosing Bühler’s technology, Agroloop can enter the value chain with the highest standards,” said István Nagy.

Andreas Baumann, head of Market Segment Insect Technology at Bühler, added, “We are very proud to be part of this pioneering project for the CEE region and delighted to see that our solutions will contribute to more sustainable feed supply chains.”

In the pursuit of sustainable and environmentally friendly practices, the CEE region is increasingly turning to alternative sources for feed ingredients. By incorporating insects into the feed supply chain, the region can address environmental concerns, reduce dependence on imported protein sources, and contribute to a circular economy approach. In addition, innovative feed formulations containing insects can optimize animal health and growth, thus leading to more efficient livestock production systems.

Insects can be reared on agricultural and food processing by-products, transforming these materials into high-quality protein. This approach not only reduces the environmental impact of this value chain but also creates a closed-loop system where resources are reused and recycled. The European Union has historically been dependent on imported protein sources for animal feed, contributing to issues such as deforestation and habitat destruction in other parts of the world. By embracing the commercialization of insect-based livestock feed, the region can increase feed efficiency, reduce reliance on external sources, and contribute to local and regional food security.

Baumann commented: “The incorporation of insect ingredients in animal feed presents a compelling solution to the challenges faced by the livestock industry. Besides providing nutritious and sustainable protein source, insects also empower local economies to become self-sufficient. That is why insect protein is seen as a key component for a more sustainable and resilient food system.”"

1144518517,20231206,"One in five children in rich countries lives in poverty: UNICEF

UNITED NATIONS, United States (AFP)— Sixty-nine million children -- or more than one in five -- live in poverty in the world's 40 richest countries UNICEF said in a report released Wednesday, blasting Britain and France for their particularly bad standings.

That's despite a drop in child poverty rates in the periods from 2012 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021, by around eight per cent in the 40 European Union and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) wealthy countries assessed.

""This is equivalent to around six million children out of a total child population of 291 million,"" said UNICEF Innocenti, the United Nations agency's research arm.

But at the end of 2021 there were still more than 69 million kids in poverty in those countries.

""For most children this means that they may grow up without enough nutritious food, clothes, school supplies or a warm place to call home,"" said Bo Viktor Nylund of UNICEF Innocenti, highlighting the impact of such struggles on young people's physical and mental health.

The UNICEF figure is based on relative poverty, which is around 60 per cent of the national median income, often used in developed countries to establish their own poverty levels.

The report called for action to ensure children's well-being and for political will among the countries surveyed, stressing that a country's' wealth did not automatically lift its children out of poverty.

Since 2012, the biggest setbacks have been seen in some of the richest countries.

Britain saw a 19.6 per cent jump in child poverty -- or half a million extra children, and France's rate went up 10.4 per cent.

In the United States, the number of poor children has fallen by 6.7 per cent, but more than one child in four still lives in relative poverty.

And the poverty rate in 2019-2021 was twice as high as in Denmark, a country with a similar per-capita income.

Underlining the link between child poverty and economic inequality, the report also highlights the greater risk of poverty for children from single-parent families and minority backgrounds.

In the United States, 30 per cent of African American children and 29 per cent of Native American children live below the national poverty line, compared with only one-in-10 non-Hispanic white children.

In the EU, a child with parents of non-EU nationality is 2.4 times more likely to live in poverty."

1144525563,20231206,"Not all of us have the same level of access to knowledge of the full barbaric extent of the atrocities committed by Hamas on Israeli civilians, on October 7.

Some may still be unsure of the exact details during those horrific hours as Hamas and Islamic Jihad entered Israeli sovereign territory, breaching an existing ceasefire in order to murder, rape, and mutilate without distinction for age or sex, and to carry off 240 hostages back to their lair in Gaza.

But we can be sure that Belgium’s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez know very well.

These leaders know the truth

Like many European leaders, De Croo and Sanchez met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem. They then traveled south to Kibbutz Be’eri on the Gaza border to see directly the destruction caused by Hamas.

A third of the members of the kibbutz were murdered on October 7 and others kidnapped by the terrorists. Many are still held.

Prime Minister Sanchez, from the country that currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Council (with Belgium next), unequivocally condemned the terror attacks, and stated the absolute right of Israel to defend itself. So far, so good, and no less than we would expect from the leaders of Europe’s democracies. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez delivers a national statement at the World Climate Action Summit during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, December 1, 2023. (credit: THAIER AL-SUDANI/REUTERS)

Then, together with his Belgian counterpart, Sanchez traveled to the Rafah crossing to continue their diplomatic mission, engaging in a level of political cynicism that disgraces both them and the European Union.

At their press conference in Rafah, they apparently forgot the name of the terror organization, Hamas, that murdered and butchered some 1,200 Israelis. The organization that rules Gaza, that uses schools and hospitals to launch attacks on Israel, that hides its soldiers in underground tunnels and its leaders in luxury hotels in Qatar while its own Palestinian citizens suffer the consequences of its actions.

The organization that rules Gaza today because it threw Palestinian Authority officials off the top of multi-story buildings or tied them to motorcycles to pull their lifeless bodies through the streets of Gaza. That is Hamas, Mr Prime Ministers. The one designated by the EU, which you currently preside over, as a terror organization.

At Rafah, they chose to condemn Israel, not Hamas. They demanded an immediate ceasefire, yet a demand for the immediate release of all the hostages was somehow not forthcoming.

De Croo and Sanchez had a clear choice then and still do, one between defending a fellow liberal democracy against terrorism or supporting the terrorists. Last week they did both in the space of hours, apparently depending on their personal location at the given time of asking.

Still today, more than half of all the hostages remain in Hamas captivity. And with the terror group having broken the terms of the temporary truce, and having dragged out even those releases it did allow in the most cynical way to ensure the greatest possible suffering for Israeli families, surely it must be now abundantly clear to any European politician that the condition for any permanent cessation of hostilities is the immediate release of all hostages and the removal of the Hamas terror threat in Gaza.

There is no equivalent whatsoever between a democratic Israel which has been forced to wrestle with the moral dilemma to release three convicted violent Palestinian terrorists to secure the return home of a single Israeli child, while Hamas made sure that as many Israeli children remained in isolated incarceration as possible in order to release three of its violent terrorists from prison.

But for European leaders like De Croo and Sanchez, it seems sometimes that Israel and Hamas are just two sides of the same coin depending on the location of their press conferences.Israel understands who comes to give real solidarity and empathy. And we, European Jews, draw our own conclusions.

We understand that a Europe that willingly and rightly supported the military attacks on Serbia to rid the Balkans of the evil of Slobodan Milosevic and the bombing of Mosul to rid the world of ISIS, has different criteria when it comes to the Jewish state. It apparently has different criteria for Jews and there is a word for that. Thankfully, the same rules weren’t applied to the bombing of Germany by the allies to get rid of the Nazis.

And we know, too, how this message filters down to the European street and beyond into antisemitic attacks on Jews in our cities, which have multiplied exponentially in recent weeks. If there is moral equivalence between victim and perpetrator, is it not in the least bit surprising that Jewish citizens on European streets are as much fair game as Israeli victims in Kibbutz Be’eri?

To great fanfare this year, member states of the European Union, including Spain, announced their grandiose plans to combat antisemitism and foster Jewish life. We are still waiting for Belgium.

The actions last week of the current president of the Council of the European Union and his Belgian colleague are fostering antisemitism, and destroying Jewish life in Europe.

The writer is president of the European Jewish Congress."

The investigation was launched following a tipoff and information provided by unidentified U.S. “government agencies,” prosecutors said in a statement. They said the agencies were investigating illegal exports of dual-use goods and money laundering in the United States.

The six were detained during searches of private homes and company headquarters in Knokke-Heist and Eeklo in Belgium, and just over the border in Sluis and Rotterdam, Netherlands, the statement said. No names of suspects or companies were provided.

The 27-nation European Union has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Part of the aim is to stop high-tech and other products with possible military uses from reaching the Russian armed forces. The U.S. has taken similar steps.

At the end of October, a Dutch court convicted a Russian businessman of exporting computer chips and other electronic products to the Russian arms and defense industry in violation of EU sanctions and sentenced him to 18 months in jail.

For more than seven months, the businessman exported “dual-use” products that can have both civil and military applications to companies linked to the arms industry in Russia.

The court ruled that he faked invoices for the exports and sent them to Russia via a company in the Maldives. His company was fined $212,000."

1144535162,20231206,"WASHINGTON/KYIV — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's chief of staff said on Tuesday (Dec 5) that the postponement of US assistance for Kyiv being debated in Congress would create a ""big risk"" of Ukraine losing the war with Russia.

The remarks by Andriy Yermak were some of the frankest yet from a senior Kyiv official as uncertainty swirls over the future of vital US and European Union assistance packages as Ukraine's war with Russia rages on.

If the aid is postponed, ""it gives the big risk that we can be in the same position to which we're located now,"" he said, addressing the audience in English.

""And of course, it makes this very high possibility impossible to continually liberate and give the big risk to lose this war.""

On Monday, White House officials said the US was running out of time and money to help Ukraine fight its war against Russia.

President Joe Biden's administration asked Congress in October for nearly US$106 billion (S$142 billion) to fund ambitious plans for Ukraine, Israel and US border security but Republicans who control the House with a slim majority rejected the package.

US officials hope they can still get a significant package approved.

Yermak singled out the threat of no more direct budgetary support as a problem. The Ukrainian government expects to have a US$43 billion budget deficit next year.

""Of course, without this direct budget support, it will be difficult to keep… in (the) same positions and... for the people to really survive...during the situation when the war will continue,"" he said.

""That is why it is extremely critically important that this support will be voted and will be voted as soon as possible.""

Yermak was making his second visit to Washington in a matter of weeks. He said he planned to press lawmakers and administration officials on the critical importance that Congress approve the new aid package.

Ukraine conducted a major counteroffensive push this year, but was unable to break through Russian defencive lines. Russia is now on the offencive in the east.

Yermak said that Kyiv had a plan for the next year.

""We really have a plan and this plan...includes the military operations... includes diplomatic activity and of course it includes our co-operation in the communications and information,"" he said.

1144543839,20231206,"United Nations, United States—Sixty-nine million children — or more than one in five — live in poverty in the world’s 40 richest countries UNICEF said in a report released Wednesday, blasting Britain and France for their particularly bad standings.

That’s despite a drop in child poverty rates in the periods from 2012 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021, by around 8 percent in the 40 European Union and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) wealthy countries assessed.

“This is equivalent to around 6 million children out of a total child population of 291 million,” said UNICEF Innocenti, the United Nations agency’s research arm.

But at the end of 2021 there were still more than 69 million kids in poverty in those countries.

“For most children this means that they may grow up without enough nutritious food, clothes, school supplies or a warm place to call home,” said Bo Viktor Nylund of UNICEF Innocenti, highlighting the impact of such struggles on young people’s physical and mental health.

The UNICEF figure is based on relative poverty, which is around 60 percent of the national median income, often used in developed countries to establish their own poverty levels.

The report called for action to ensure children’s well-being and for political will among the countries surveyed, stressing that a country’s’ wealth did not automatically lift its children out of poverty.

Since 2012, the biggest setbacks have been seen in some of the richest countries.

Britain saw a 19.6 percent jump in child poverty — or half a million extra children, and France’s rate went up 10.4 percent.

In the United States, the number of poor children has fallen by 6.7 percent, but more than one child in four still lives in relative poverty.

And the poverty rate in 2019-2021 was twice as high as in Denmark, a country with a similar per-capita income.

Underlining the link between child poverty and economic inequality, the report also highlights the greater risk of poverty for children from single-parent families and minority backgrounds.

In the United States, 30 percent of African American children and 29 percent of Native American children live below the national poverty line, compared with only one-in-10 non-Hispanic white children.

In the EU, a child with parents of non-EU nationality is 2.4 times more likely to live in poverty."

1144551188,20231206,"The European Union (EU) should pursue peaceful economic cooperation with China and avoid decoupling from the world’s second largest economy, a Hungarian expert told Xinhua in an interview.

Decoupling from China would be a “mistake” that would harm both the EU and China, Zoltan Kiszelly, director of the Center of Political Analyses at Hungary’s Szazadveg Institute, said. China is one of the EU’s largest trading partners, and bilateral trade has grown rapidly in recent years.

“As China is the biggest single market for the EU, it should appreciate this partner and should not repeat the mistake of ill-considered and self-harming sanctions on Russia,” Kiszelly said.

Kiszelly’s comments come amid growing tensions between the EU and China. The EU has been criticizing China’s economic practices, talking of “decoupling” or “de-risking,” and has decided to launch an anti-subsidy probe into Chinese-made electric vehicles.

Despite these tensions, Kiszelly said that the EU should continue to engage with China. “Cooperation between the EU and China has made these two poles of the world economy one another’s biggest trading partners,” Kiszelly said, reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership.

A recent survey conducted by Hungary’s Szazadveg Foundation revealed that 48 percent of Europeans favored maintaining economic and trade relations with China, Kiszelly said.

He said that this opinion resonated with a significant majority across two-thirds of the European countries surveyed, advocating for peaceful economic cooperation with China rather than harsher measures.

The survey also found that Hungarians are more likely than Europeans in general to view China favorably.

Hungary has close economic ties with China and has been a vocal supporter of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

Regarding Hungary’s stance on cooperation with China, Kiszelly said Prime Minister Viktor Orban is endorsing a policy of connectivity, promoting mutually beneficial economic and manufacturing partnerships between European and Chinese companies.

The collaboration between Germany’s high-end car manufacturers and Chinese car suppliers, both present in Hungary, exemplifies that China and the EU companies benefit from such alliances, he said.

The upcoming EU-China Summit, the first face-to-face meeting between the two sides’ leaders in four years, is a “good opportunity to build back trust and to clear up misunderstandings,” Kiszelly said.

Future cooperation between China and the EU can be strengthened in the high value-added domains, such as telecommunications, digital equipment, and the automotive industry, he said, adding that both sides had “common interests” in fighting climate change."

The support page indicates that while you won’t be able to start new cross-platform conversations, your existing chats on Instagram will become read-only.

The social media giant first introduced cross-platform messaging in 2020. And three years later, after adding features like group chat along the way, the company is shutting down the feature without much fanfare.

Meta didn’t provide a specific reason for discontinuing the cross-platform messaging feature. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires large messaging apps to be interoperable with each other.

In September, WABetaInfo reported that Meta-owned WhatsApp has started working on an interoperability feature as the blog spotted a “third-party chats” screen.

In August, the social media giant said that it aims to turn on end-to-end encryption for Messenger users by default by the end of the year. At that time, Meta’s deputy privacy officer Rob Sherman said Instagram DMs would also get end-to-end encryption protection once the Messenger rollout is complete. The company didn’t immediately comment if the discontinuation of cross-platform messaging was related to this development.

Separately, Meta also agreed to overhaul its account center to allow users a greater degree of control over cross-site activities, upon the direction of the German antitrust body in June."

1144570176,20231206,"When European Union leaders introduced a 125-page draft law to regulate artificial intelligence in April 2021, they hailed it as a global model for handling the technology.EU lawmakers had gotten input from thousands of experts for three years about AI, when the topic was not even on the table in other countries. The result was a ""landmark"" policy that was ""future-proof,"" declared Margrethe Vestager, the head of digital policy for the 27-nation bloc.Then came ChatGPT.The eerily humanlike chatbot, which went viral last year by generating its own answers to prompts, blindsided EU policymakers. The type of AI that powered ChatGPT was not mentioned in the draft law and was not a major focus of discussions about the policy. Lawmakers and their aides peppered one another with calls and texts to address the gap, as tech executives warned that overly aggressive regulations could put Europe at an economic disadvantage.Even now, EU lawmakers are arguing over what to do, putting the law at risk. ""We will always be lagging behind the speed of technology,"" said Svenja Hahn, a member of the European Parliament who was involved in writing the AI law.Lawmakers and regulators in Brussels, in Washington and elsewhere are losing a battle to regulate AI and are racing to catch up as concerns grow that the powerful technology will automate away jobs, turbocharge the spread of disinformation and eventually develop its own kind of intelligence. Nations have moved swiftly to tackle AI's potential perils, but European officials have been caught off guard by the technology's evolution, while U.S. lawmakers openly concede that they barely understand how it works.The result has been a sprawl of responses. President Joe Biden issued an executive order in October about AI's national security effects as lawmakers debate what, if any, measures to pass. Japan is drafting nonbinding guidelines for the technology, while China has imposed restrictions on certain types of AI. Britain has said existing laws are adequate for regulating the technology. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are pouring government money into AI research.At the root of the fragmented actions is a fundamental mismatch. AI systems are advancing so rapidly and unpredictably that lawmakers and regulators can't keep pace. That gap has been compounded by an AI knowledge deficit in governments, labyrinthine bureaucracies and fears that too many rules may inadvertently limit the technology's benefits.Even in Europe, perhaps the world's most aggressive tech regulator, AI has befuddled policymakers.The European Union has plowed ahead with its new law, the AI Act, despite disputes over how to handle the makers of the latest AI systems. A final agreement, expected as soon as Wednesday, could restrict certain risky uses of the technology and create transparency requirements about how the underlying systems work. But even if it passes, it is not expected to take effect for at least 18 months -- a lifetime in AI development -- and how it will be enforced is unclear.""The jury is still out about whether you can regulate this technology or not,"" said Andrea Renda, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Policy Studies, a think tank in Brussels. ""There's a risk this EU text ends up being prehistorical.""The absence of rules has left a vacuum. Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, have been left to police themselves as they race to create and profit from advanced AI systems. Many companies, preferring nonbinding codes of conduct that provide latitude to speed up development, are lobbying to soften proposed regulations and pitting governments against one another.Without united action soon, some officials warned, governments may get further left behind by the AI makers and their breakthroughs.""No one, not even the creators of these systems, know what they will be able to do,"" said Matt Clifford, an adviser to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain, who presided over an AI Safety Summit last month with 28 countries. ""The urgency comes from there being a real question of whether governments are equipped to deal with and mitigate the risks.""In mid-2018, 52 academics, computer scientists and lawyers met at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Brussels to discuss artificial intelligence. EU officials had selected them to provide advice about the technology, which was drawing attention for powering driverless cars and facial recognition systems.The group debated whether there were already enough European rules to protect against the technology and considered potential ethics guidelines, said Nathalie Smuha, a legal scholar in Belgium who coordinated the group.But as they discussed AI's possible effects -- including the threat of facial recognition technology to people's privacy -- they recognized ""there were all these legal gaps, and what happens if people don't follow those guidelines?"" she said.In 2019, the group published a 52-page report with 33 recommendations, including more oversight of AI tools that could harm individuals and society.The report rippled through the insular world of EU policymaking. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, made the topic a priority on her digital agenda. A 10-person group was assigned to build on the group's ideas and draft a law. Another committee in the European Parliament, the European Union's co-legislative branch, held nearly 50 hearings and meetings to consider AI's effects on cybersecurity, agriculture, diplomacy and energy.In 2020, European policymakers decided that the best approach was to focus on how AI was used and not the underlying technology. AI was not inherently good or bad, they said; it depended on how it was applied.So when the AI Act was unveiled in 2021, it concentrated on ""high-risk"" uses of the technology, including in law enforcement, school admissions and hiring. It largely avoided regulating the AI models that powered them unless listed as dangerous.Under the proposal, organizations offering risky AI tools must meet certain requirements to ensure those systems are safe before being deployed. AI software that created manipulated videos and ""deepfake"" images must disclose that people are seeing AI-generated content. Other uses were banned or restricted, such as live facial recognition software. Violators could be fined 6% of their global sales.Some experts warned that the draft law did not account enough for AI's future twists and turns.""They sent me a draft, and I sent them back 20 pages of comments,"" said Stuart Russell, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who advised the European Commission. ""Anything not on their list of high-risk applications would not count, and the list excluded ChatGPT and most AI systems.""EU leaders were undeterred.""Europe may not have been the leader in the last wave of digitalization, but it has it all to lead the next one,"" Vestager said when she introduced the policy at a news conference in Brussels.Nineteen months later, ChatGPT arrived.The European Council, another branch of the EU, had just agreed to regulate general-purpose AI models, but the new chatbot reshuffled the debate. It revealed a ""blind spot"" in the bloc's policymaking over the technology, said Dragos Tudorache, a member of the European Parliament who had argued before ChatGPT's release that the new models must be covered by the law. These general-purpose AI systems not only power chatbots but can also learn to perform many tasks by analyzing data culled from the internet and other sources.EU officials were divided over how to respond. Some were wary of adding too many new rules, especially as Europe has struggled to nurture its own tech companies. Others wanted more stringent limits.""We want to be careful not to underdo it, but not overdo it as well and overregulate things that are not yet clear,"" said Tudorache, a lead negotiator on the AI Act.By October, the governments of France, Germany and Italy, the three largest EU economies, had come out against strict regulation of general-purpose AI models, for fear of hindering their domestic tech startups. Others in the European Parliament said the law would be toothless without addressing the technology. Divisions over the use of facial recognition technology also persisted.Policymakers were still working on compromises as negotiations over the law's language entered a final stage this week. A European Commission spokesperson said the AI Act was ""flexible relative to future developments and innovation-friendly.""Jack Clark, a founder of the AI startup Anthropic, had visited Washington for years to give lawmakers tutorials on AI. Almost always, just a few congressional aides showed up.But after ChatGPT went viral, his presentations became packed with lawmakers and aides clamoring to hear his AI crash course and views on rule making.""Everyone has sort of woken up en masse to this technology,"" said Clark, whose company recently hired two lobbying firms in Washington.Lacking tech expertise, lawmakers are increasingly relying on Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and other AI makers to explain how it works and to help create rules.""We're not experts,"" said Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., who hosted Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, and more than 50 lawmakers at a dinner in Washington in May. ""It's important to be humble.""Tech companies have seized their advantage. In the first half of the year, many of Microsoft's and Google's combined 169 lobbyists met with lawmakers and the White House to discuss AI legislation, according to lobbying disclosures. OpenAI registered its first three lobbyists, and a tech lobbying group unveiled a $25 million campaign to promote AI's benefits this year.In that same period, Altman met with more than 100 members of Congress, including former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and the Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. After testifying in Congress in May, Altman embarked on a 17-city global tour, meeting world leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France, Sunak and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.In Washington, the activity around AI has been frenetic -- but with no legislation to show for it.In May, after a White House meeting about AI, the leaders of Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Anthropic were asked to draw up self-regulations to make their systems safer, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president. After Microsoft submitted suggestions, the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, sent the proposal back with instructions to add more promises, he said.Two months later, the White House announced that the four companies had agreed to voluntary commitments on AI safety, including testing their systems through third-party overseers -- which most of the companies were already doing.""It was brilliant,"" Smith said. ""Instead of people in government coming up with ideas that might have been impractical, they said, 'Show us what you think you can do, and we'll push you to do more.'""Over the summer, the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into OpenAI and how it handles user data. Lawmakers continued welcoming tech executives.In September, Schumer was the host of Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Sundar Pichai of Google, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Altman at a closed-door meeting with lawmakers in Washington to discuss AI rules. Musk warned of AI's ""civilizational"" risks, while Altman proclaimed that AI could solve global problems such as poverty.Schumer said the companies knew the technology best.In some cases, AI companies are playing governments off one another. In Europe, industry groups have warned that regulations could put the EU behind the United States. In Washington, tech companies have cautioned that China might pull ahead.In May, Vestager, Raimondo and Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, met in Lulea, Sweden, to discuss cooperating on digital policy.After two days of talks, Vestager announced that Europe and the United States would release a shared code of conduct for safeguarding AI ""within weeks."" She messaged colleagues in Brussels asking them to share her social media post about the pact, which she called a ""huge step in a race we can't afford to lose.""Months later, no shared code of conduct had appeared. The United States instead announced AI guidelines of its own.Little progress has been made internationally on AI. With countries mired in economic competition and geopolitical distrust, many are setting their own rules for the borderless technology.Yet ""weak regulation in another country will affect you,"" said Rajeev Chandrasekhar, India's technology minister, noting that a lack of rules around U.S. social media companies led to a wave of global disinformation.""Most of the countries impacted by those technologies were never at the table when policies were set,"" he said. ""AI will be several factors more difficult to manage.""Even among allies, the issue has been divisive. At the meeting in Sweden between EU and U.S. officials, Blinken criticized Europe for moving forward with AI regulations that could harm American companies, one attendee said. Thierry Breton, a European commissioner, shot back that the United States could not dictate European policy, the person said.A European Commission spokesperson said that the United States and Europe had ""worked together closely"" on AI policy and that the Group of 7 countries unveiled a voluntary code of conduct in October.A State Department spokesperson said there had been ""ongoing, constructive conversations"" with the European Union, including the G7 accord. At the meeting in Sweden, he added, Blinken emphasized the need for a ""unified approach"" to AI.Some policymakers said they hoped for progress at an AI safety summit that Britain held last month at Bletchley Park, where mathematician Alan Turing helped crack the Enigma code used by the Nazis. The gathering featured Vice President Kamala Harris; Wu Zhaohui, China's vice minister of science and technology; Musk; and others.The upshot was a 12-paragraph statement describing AI's ""transformative"" potential and ""catastrophic"" risk of misuse. Attendees agreed to meet again next year.The talks, in the end, produced a deal to keep talking."

MOSCOW. Dec 6 (Interfax) - The absolute majority of European Union member states support the start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession to the EU, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said.

""You are all following the events and see the tension created by Hungary around this issue. [...] But there is an absolute majority in the EU that supports the opening of accession talks with Ukraine,"" Ukrainian media quoted Kuleba as saying at a press conference with Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Gerdina Johannette Bruins in Kiev on Tuesday.

A key topic on the meeting's agenda was preparations for the European Council's meeting next week, which is expected to adopt a ""historic"" decision on the start of membership talks with Ukraine, he said.

""I received assurances today that the Netherlands will support this decision and will lobby for its adoption at the European Council meeting,"" Kuleba said.

The upcoming meeting of the European Council will not be easy, the Ukrainian foreign minister said.

""But we have reasons to believe that the decision that it needed to ensure macrofinancial support for Ukraine will be adopted after all,"" he said.

A final decision on opening the talks will be adopted by EU heads of state and heads of government at the European Council's meeting in Brussels on December 14-15.

Latest figures from the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development’s dairy services department indicated that farmers have produced 81 million litres since the beginning of the year compared to 91 million litres which was produced in the whole of last year.

Milk intake by processors also rose to 74 million litres from 67 million litres last year.

Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Permanent Secretary Professor Obert Jiri said statistics signify the Government’s thrust for import substitution and growth in the dairy sector.

Milk production has been increasing as more farmers have taken up dairy farming, amid growing support from the Government, while the national herd has been supplemented with imported heifers to accelerate growth from the local breeding stock.

Zimbabwe Association of Dairy Farmers (ZADF) Mashonaland West Region vice chairman Mr Cloudious Burira said this year a target of over 100 million litres is inevitable following various measures implemented by the Government to boost production.

”We are targeting more milk this season but the weather is not currently good for milk production. Milk production was raised high by the little rains which we received a few weeks ago. The European Union donor fund also played a critical role in uplifting milk production. Field officers went to all regions educating farmers on ways to boost milk production. We were also educated on how to prepare farm feed formula,’’ he said.

He said these are some of the interventions that the private sector and the Government are undertaking to boost the sector.

The dairy heifer growth is funded by the Dairy Development Fund, which entails expanding the dairy herd from about 19 000 dairy herd to about 25 000.

The Presidential Silage Programme targeted 1 500 smallholder dairy farmers with a standard input package for one-hectare silage for each household of dairy farmers to help improve productivity in the dairy sub-sector.

Zimbabwe Farmers’ Union economist Ms Nyasha Taderera recently indicated that the improvement made so far in the dairy sector is a positive step towards the growth of the dairy industry.

“This is a positive step towards improvement of the dairy sector. There will be a reduction in the import of milk powders from South Africa. This also shows that milk consumption in the country will increase and there will be more investors in the dairy industry,” she said.

Under the livestock and recovery growth plan, milk production is intended to rise to 150 million litres, and increase the dairy herd from 39 980 to 60 000 by 2025.

About US$75 million is required to fully revitalise the sector"

This measure has been supported by the emergency energy package of the European Union, where the Ministry of Finance, Labor and Transfers has received financial support in the amount of 75 million euros, of which 5 million have been allocated for subsidizing families with social assistance.

The Minister of Finance, Labor and Transfers, Hekuran Murati, said that the families who will benefit from this subsidy do not need to apply, since the Centers for Social Work have the families who accept the social support.

He emphasized that the Department for Social Work calculates that 120 euros will be allocated to each family, which is very equivalent to two cubic meters of fuel at the market price, while adding that an additional 30 euros will be allocated to each family member. the family.

Meanwhile, regarding measure 1.2, the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Albin Kurti, said that with this amount, the Government will provide subsidies for the purchase of fuel for families with social assistance, in order to overcome the winter as easily as possible.

He emphasized how the government executed the strategy for the protection and increase of citizens' well-being in two directions. These were done, according to him, responding to the need to alleviate the difficulties of the crisis and promoting sustainable solutions for families in need through employment in the labor market.

While talking about the achievements, Kurti emphasized the fact about the care of expectant mothers and children, where he emphasized that more than 49 thousand mothers and 387 thousand children have benefited so far.

The Head of the Cooperation Section at the European Union Office in Kosovo, Johannes Madsen Stenbaek, said that the purpose of this support is to accelerate economic development, through investment and financing through grants.

He added that they expect further cooperation in the energy sector and implementation and investment reforms, to ensure, as he said, a better future for all citizens of Kosovo./Mr. Zeneli"

1144620133,20231206,"On the back of news that Monaco will not enter into the EU on a special Association Agreement, Monaco’s Conseil National has taken the step of publishing two legal and socio-economic studies that had been commissioned for the process, detailing exactly what impact the partnership would have meant for the residents and citizens of the Principality.

After years of negotiations, it was announced in September 2023 that Monaco and the European Union would be suspending talks regarding an Association Agreement between the Principality and the bloc.

At the time, the Prince’s Government released a statement pointing to the “impossibility of reconciling the demands of the European Union with the red lines established by H.S.H. the Prince at the opening of these discussions, which aim to ensure that the current living, working and housing conditions of nationals and residents in the Principality are maintained”.

See more: Monaco and EU suspend negotiations for an Association Agreement

Those discussions, and ultimately the decision to suspend negotiations, were the culmination of years of back-and-forth.

Monaco’s stance was largely guided by two comprehensive reports commissioned specifically by the government: a legal study carried out by Cabinet Gide, and a socio-economic study produced by Strategy&.

On Tuesday 5th December, the Conseil National published both in-depth reports in full.

Parts of the socio-economic study had already been shared “for the sake of transparency” in July. The study notably focused on the “solidity of the [current] Monegasque economic model and the numerous uncertainties that an Association Agreement with the European Union would pose for the economy and employment, in particular that of Monegasques, and for the State”.

The gravity of its findings has been now supported by those of the legal report, which admitted that establishing an Association Agreement with the EU would require Monaco to modify its constitution and its sacrosanct ‘pacte social monégasque’ that enshrines the legal rights of its citizens.

Benoît Le Bret, the author of the legal report, also acknowledges that such an agreement would result in “at least partial loss of legal sovereignty” for Monaco.

Régis Bergonzi, who headed the monitoring commission regarding the negotiations, says that the two reports “highlight the risks of social disruption, with the end of national priority for Monegasques, and the risks that economic players in the Monaco market would have incurred” if the agreement had gone ahead.

There is no signal that negotiations will resume any time soon, if ever, but President of the Conseil National Brigitte Boccone-Pagès has indicated that, for better or worse, the impact studies will “serve as a basis for any reflection concerning possible sectoral agreements with our European partners”.

In reading the reports, the crux of the matter appears to be the issue of finding common ground between the EU’s stance on non-discrimination based on nationality. This, admits the National Council, is “nevertheless the very foundation of the Monegasque social pact”.

“This is, in fact, based on national priority in access to housing, employment and certain professions, supplemented by a series of specific advantages for French nationals and rights holders, woven over the years,” reads a statement from the Conseil National. “For [the EU’s] part, the current regulations specific to Monegasque-regulated professions cannot survive an Association Agreement. The same goes for certain administrative positions. Indeed, imposing freedom of movement, without a priority rule, would allow any European citizen to apply for a public position, which is not a feasible option in Monaco.”

Monaco’s position with regards to its relationship with the EU will continue much as it did before the negotiations were curtailed.

“The EU is and will remain a privileged partner of the Principality,” says the government. “The EU and Monaco share many common values and the Principality will continue to support the EU’s action on the international scene, particularly in terms of sanctions. Monaco therefore wishes to continue the dialogue and reflect, with the European Union, on ways to strengthen this relationship.”

1144626243,20231206,"Dutch politician Geert Wilders aims to stop the invasion of Europe: Don Feder

Our myna-bird media refer to Dutch politician Geet Wilders, who could be the next prime minister of the Netherlands, as “far right,” hard right,” an “anti-Islam firebrand” and a “Donald Trump clone.” They missed MAGA Republican.

Mr. Wilders won a huge victory in last week’s parliamentary elections. His Party for Freedom went from 17 seats to 37 seats in the lower house — a plurality that puts Mr. Wilders in line to form the next government.

While he ran on a broad range of issues, the Dutch Donald is best known for promising to stem the tide of Muslim immigration.

He’s also pledged to move the Dutch Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Strange how so many “far right” leaders — including the newly elected president of Argentina — want to express their solidarity with the Jewish state. Someone forgot to tell them that they’re supposed to be antisemites.

Mr. Wilders joins a hardy band of immigration skeptics, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who cheered Mr. Wilders’ victory. (“The winds of change are here!”) The Alternative for Germany party, also opposed to open borders, is now in second place in polling, with 20% support. In France, Marine Le Pen waits her turn.

The Netherlands has taken in an average of 200,000 immigrants a year since 2016, most unassimilable.

The Netherlands, whose population is only 16 million, is now home to 1 million Muslims. Since the 2004 murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh for exposing the treatment of women under Islam, a growing number of Dutch have concluded that the immigrants will not end up wearing wooden shoes and planting tulips.

The Dutch aren’t the only Europeans who are nervous. In France, a new mosque is opened every two weeks, and a Catholic institution is closed during the same period. In a gesture of goodwill, the grand imam of Paris has suggested that decommissioned churches be turned into mosques.

Since 2003, the number of mosques in the land of Charles Martel has grown from 1,500 to 2,400. Muslims now make up 9% of the French population. How well they’ve assimilated can be seen in the designation “no-go zones” for majority-immigrant areas around Paris where the gendarmes dare not venture.

Malmo, Sweden’s third-largest city, is home to 50,000 Muslims, 600 Jews and raging antisemitism. If present trends continue, it’s estimated that 30% of Sweden will be Muslim by 2050. Once a nation known for its hospitality, Sweden is now the rape capital of Europe, with three times the European Union average of registered sexual assaults.

Some think you can replace one population with another and end up with the same results.

In London, 100,000 marched, calling for Israel’s extinction. Britain’s capital has a Muslim mayor, and on Remembrance Day, police had to be deployed to protect war memorials from those who say they wish Hitler had won the Second World War.

Islam is the dominant religion of Brussels. In Spain, the number of mosques is growing by 20% a year. It’s estimated that by 2046, 1 in 3 Viennese will profess faith in Islam.

There’s more at work here than open borders.

Europeans are at the center of a demographic storm. For the EU as a whole, the fertility rate (the number of children the average woman will have in her lifetime) is only 1.4, well below the replacement level of 2.1. European Muslims have a fertility rate of 2.6.

At the root of Europe’s demographic crisis is a loss of faith. In Germany, the number of baptisms — Catholic and Protestant — went from 800 a day in 2012 to 390 a day 10 years later. It’s believed that there are more practicing Muslims than practicing Catholics in France.

The continent that once was known as Christendom has lost its religion. On Sunday morning, churches are empty except for a few old women. Empty pews lead to empty cradles.

The fall of the Roman Empire became inevitable when citizens stopped having children and fertile barbarians were allowed to settle on Roman land. Soon, the army was dominated by those dedicated to Rome’s destruction.

In 2006, the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi proclaimed: “There are signs that Allah will grant Islam victory in Europe — without swords, without guns, without conquest.”

In 1683, the Ottoman siege of Vienna was lifted by Polish King Jan Sobieski, halting the last Muslim advance in Europe. Today, Mr. Wilders, Mr. Orban and their allies are standing at the gates of Vienna.

1144626248,20231206,"Senate President Godswill Akpabio and Bishop Mathew Kukah have stressed the need to reposition political parties to build a democratic culture that fosters inclusivity, transparency and accountability.

They made the call at the Public Presentation of the Needs Assessment of Political Parties in Nigeria, organised by Kukah Centre with support from European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN), in Abuja.

Akpabio, who was represented by Sen. Victor Umeh, said repositioning political parties would help to restore public trust and confidence in them, ensuring that they remained true representatives of the aspirations of the people.

He said that this was imperative because lack of accountability, inclusivity, transparency, and inherent impunity were some significant challenges that must be confronted.

“ Political parties have not only provided platforms for citizens to participate in the democratic process but have also played a vital role in shaping our nation’s policies and governance structures.

“However, it would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the issues that have marred our democratic culture.

“These issues have led to a decrease in public trust and confidence in political parties. It is disheartening to witness citizens disenchanted with the very institutions that should represent their interests and safeguard their democratic rights.’’

Akpabio expressed hope in the 10th National Assembly to address the menace, adding that it was crucial that political parties were accountable to the people they serve.

He said that party leaders should be held responsible for their actions and decisions, and mechanisms for transparency and oversight should be put in place.

He added that inclusivity was key, therefore, political parties should actively strive towards ensuring that every citizen had a voice and an opportunity to participate in the political process.

Akpabio encouraged political parties to enhance transparency, to build trust and confidence while party financing and campaign expenditures should be made public and subjected to scrutiny.

“The publication of the “Needs Assessment of Political Parties in Nigeria” serves as a valuable resource and roadmap for addressing these challenges.

“It provides a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of our political parties and offers valuable recommendations for reform.’’

Bishop Matthew Kukah , Founder of Kukah Foundation, said the event was aimed at proffering solutions to political parties’ challenges, to help inspire confidence in politics.

“We at the Kukah Centre are poised to help create confidence in politics because we believe in the state as a vehicle for delivery of public goods.

“Political Parties are the platforms on which politicians are weaned, trained and deployed to serve the public good.

“We want to dredge up some of the good, the bad and the very ugly phases of our national history so that we can have an idea of where we have come from.

“In the process, we need to see if there are any good markers or signs that those who came before us left. Hopefully, from their experiences, we can begin to think more clearly about how to make politics noble.’’

Kukah said that without a proper understanding of political party processes, young men and women with vision would have a clear idea of the imagination and the resources required to form political parties.

“This project is very important to us because it is my hope that it will be part of our learning curve, a testing ground.

“To this end, this project will benefit both our researchers, those engaged in the project and those of us who will consume the products of this hard work.’’

Kukah said the needs assessment recommended options for parties to consider, to become the ideological engine rooms for driving the political processes and democracy.

He said that the report drew not just academic analysis but a range of interviews across a wide spectrum of the society, listening to the views of ordinary citizens.

He said the report recommended a constant review of the Electoral Act, the need to incorporate the opposition as part of the political process and the need to create more innovative ways of financing political parties.

Others include re-examining the place of party financing, among others.

Ms Olawunmi Laolu, Programme Manager, EU-SDGN, said it was important for political parties to strengthen their internal democracy to improve intra and inter party dialogue and promote wide participation on inclusiveness in the political process.

“The EU is pleased to work with political parties and support this process through our flagship democracy support programme.

“Nigeria’s progress determines the future of democracy in West Africa and indeed, on the continent, Nigeria has an opportunity to lead and through its leadership, reverse the trend of democratic backsliding in the region.

“We in the European Union, strongly count on Nigeria and non-Nigerian political parties to lead by example; I am very hopeful that today’s proceedings will provide a platform to build consensus around the most critical issues affecting Nigeria’s political culture.”

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that other stakeholders like the Independent Nation Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) among others, were present.

1144640157,20231206,"Farmers in England’s southeast and its surrounding areas have been urged to be vigilant for bluetongue virus (BTV) on their farms.

This warning from the UK’s chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, follows the news of the seven cases being detected in Kent.

The first case of BTV was identified by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and the Pirbright Institute on November 11, by using Britain’s annual bluetongue surveillance programme. As of today (Wednesday, December 6), a further six cases have been identified since.

The two most recent cases detected have been linked to a holding with previously confirmed cases of BTV serotype 3 (BTV-3).

A temporary control zone has been put in place around the affected farms, restricting the movement of susceptible animals except under licence.

To reduce the risk of onward disease transmission, the infected animals have been culled.

Middlemass said: “This detection is an example of our robust disease surveillance procedures in action, and it is also a clear reminder for farmers that the disease remains a threat, despite coming towards the end of the midge activity season.”

A temporary control zone (TZC) has been put in place around the affected farms, restricting the movement of susceptible animals except under licence.

Strict rules on the movement of livestock from regions affected by bluetongue remain in place. Farmers are reminded that animals imported from these regions must be accompanied by the relevant paperwork, to clearly show they meet certain conditions designed to reduce disease risk, e.g., correct vaccination.

NI and GB ruminants cannot be exported from a GB Assembly Centre to the European Union, or moved to NI until further notice.

Dr. Joseph Henry, chair of the Ruminant Health and Welfare (RH&W) bluetongue working group, said:

“All of the additional confirmed cases have been on holdings within the TCZ that surrounds the original case found near Canterbury, Kent – all cases have been, or will be humanely culled to minimise any risk of onward transmission.

“On-going surveillance of all livestock will continue in the newly expanded TCZ. Please ensure your animals are registered – it’s never too late to officially register your stock.”

The virus is transmitted primarily through midges and affects cows, goats, sheep and llamas.

Farmers should pay particular attention to livestock between April and November, as midges are most active during this time period.

The symptoms can be vastly different, depending on the animal. Some show no symptoms at all, while others can experience:
• Redness or ulcers around the mouth, nose, or eyes;

Farmers are urged to report any suspicions to the APHA promptly, in order to reduce the risk of disease transmission."

While the UN Human Rights Council was conducting its Universal Periodic Review, the Cuban people were victimized by at least 300 acts of repression by the communist regime during the month of November, according to a human rights organization.

OCDH documents 300 acts of repression in November in Cuba

At least 300 acts of repression were recorded in Cuba in November while the regime in Havana underwent the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) at the United Nations Human Rights Council, as denounced this Tuesday by the Cuban Observatory of Human Rights (OCDH).

Yaxys Cires, Director of Strategy at the OCDH, told ADN Cuba that “no matter how much the dictatorship strives to present an international image that human rights are respected in Cuba and denies the existence of political prisoners, these documented violations loudly proclaim the unsustainable situation of the Cuban people.”

According to the OCDH’s statement – sent to ADN Cuba – the repressive actions during this period mainly consisted of arbitrary detentions, which occurred in 85 cases.

Another event reported by the OCDH’s network of activists on the island involves 83 abuses against political prisoners. Among them stands out the death of Luis Barrios Díaz, 37 years old, imprisoned for peacefully demonstrating on July 11, 2021.

As reported by the organization the previous month, Barrios Díaz died due to negligence by prison authorities.

Once again, in the report, the OCDH called for an investigation and justice for this death while under police custody.

Also prevalent in November were raids on the homes of activists and opponents, threats, police summons, trials, and fines.

“Amidst the analysis of Cuba at the UN regarding the human rights situation and the visit to the island by the European Union’s Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, the Cuban regime continued its repressive offensive against activists and the civilian population. This demonstrates that the current pressure mechanisms are not sufficient in protecting individuals from the government’s actions on the island,” stated the OCDH."

At the COP28 climate change conference, EIB Global, the development arm of the European Investment Bank (EIB), has presented its new approach (https://apo-opa.co/47ZYbJO) to increase financing and advisory services in support of a just transition and just resilience worldwide. The EIB will be the first international financial institution to apply a just resilience approach from the start of 2024. Building on its considerable work in the European Union, in support of communities impacted by decarbonisation efforts, EIB Global has also announced it is expanding its just transition support worldwide.

EIB Global will work with public and private partners to identify opportunities and address challenges related to a just transition and just resilience. EIB Global backs projects through direct as well as intermediated lending through funds, banks, and micro-finance institutions. In addition, EIB Global is seeking to build financial, technical and knowledge partnerships to help prepare just transition and just resilience projects worldwide.

“Decarbonising our economies and making them climate resilient must happen in a socially responsible way or it will not happen and we will not manage to meet the urgent goals we have set ourselves,” EIB vice-president Ambroise Fayolle said. “Under the new EIB Global approach for just transition and just resilience, we will be directing more support, through Team Europe initiatives, to those countries and people who are most acutely impacted by the climate crisis and are most impacted by climate policies. I call on our partners to join us in this crucial endeavour to back sustainable investment projects that leave no one behind.”

Just Resilience aims to ensure that climate adaptation policies and projects take into account the needs of everybody to avoid unintended impacts. Increasing climate resilience and ensuring just climate adaptation policies are urgently needed as rising temperatures are increasing geographical and social inequalities with devastating consequences.

From 2024 onwards, EIB Global, will focus its just resilience support on least developed countries, fragile and conflict affected states, and small island developing states. Moreover, EIB Global will target climate adaptation actions involving or benefitting those depending on natural resources and ecosystems for their livelihoods, including indigenous people, women and non-binary, young people, migrants, and other groups bearing unequal climate change burdens across the globe. EIB Global will take a more integrated approach to climate adaptation and social inclusion and combine related metrics.

A Just Transition that leaves no one behind

In the European Union, the EIB has for a long time been supporting communities impacted by the shift to a net zero future. EIB Global is now building on this experience and is extending its just transition activities in regions most affected by decarbonisation efforts and where there is an intention to shift to more sustainable economies.

EIB Global will initially focus its just transition activities on nine pilot countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Ukraine, South Africa, Indonesia, and Vietnam (https://apo-opa.co/3GwYgJn). It will support workers affected by the green transition, support projects in low-carbon infrastructure, energy efficiency, renewable energy, the development of small and mid-sized companies, education, training, and retraining, as well as environmental rehabilitation.

In doing so, EIB Global is supporting Just Energy Transition Partnerships and is working alongside Team Europe Initiatives to end coal-based energy production. Beyond the pilot countries, EIB Global will assist workers and communities affected by the closure of fossil fuel plants or activities involving fossil fuel extraction. EIB Global is prioritising the regeneration and decontamination of sites, land rehabilitation and ecosystem restoration and green infrastructure."

Belaeronavigatsiya said the decision was issued ""to protect national interests"".

The decision affects a very limited number of flights as all Belarusian airlines have been banned from entering the EU since December 2021, in response to the Minsk-orchestrated forced diversion of a Ryanair B737 to arrest anti-government activists who were onboard. Tensions subsequently heightened as Belarus sided with Russia during its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Currently, there is no airline traffic of any sort between the EU and Russia/Belarus. While non-EU foreign airlines continue to serve Minsk National, they link the city with destinations in Russia and other countries in Asia and as such, do not need to overfly the EU."

Under the new measures, the countries will ban non-industrial diamonds from Russia by January and Russian diamonds sold by third countries from March, according to a joint statement released after the meeting.

The leaders also planned to tighten controls on Russia's use of the international financial system and to impose more sanctions to enforce a price cap on Russian oil.

The measures came as Biden pleaded with Congress to fund his weeks-old request for billions of dollars more in Ukraine assistance, saying it was an ""urgent responsibility"" and would keep U.S. allies behind Ukraine. The U.S. plans to announce $175 million in additional military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, according to a U.S. official.

During the meeting, Zelenskiy called for continued support for Ukraine.

""Russia believes that America and Europe will show weakness and will not maintain support for Ukraine at the proper level. Putin believes that the free world will not fully enforce its own sanctions,"" he said, according to remarks posted to the president's website.

""The free world vitally needs to maintain its consolidation, maintain interaction, maintain support for those whose freedom is being attacked.""

The G7 members, comprising Japan, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and the European Union, pledged in May to restrict exports to Russia that could fund its war effort in Ukraine.

A statement issued at the time said the restrictions would cover exports of industrial machinery, tools and technology and it would also try to limit Russian revenues from trade in metals and diamonds.

Western nations have admitted that the impact of their $60 price cap on Russian crude oil has waned one year in, and the countries have been looking at ways to strengthen implementation.

From tomorrow we will have meetings with representatives of the Hungarian Government at the highest level. Our goal is to further develop cooperation between the two countries. This visit to our partner has been important before the final decision to be taken on [granting Georgia] candidate status”, Kobakhidze stressed.

Answering the question of whether the fact that Hungary's ruling party submitted a resolution to the parliament, calling the Government not to support the launch of negotiations on Ukraine's accession to the EU would pose a threat to Georgia “in this context”, Kobakhidze said ""this is a matter of the EU and Hungary"".

I think, in the end, an agreement will be reached regarding all this, and I do hope that Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova will receive support from all 27 countries”, he noted, adding this was what the three countries needed.

In September, the manufacturer enlisted partner Aciturri to begin assembling the first of seven fuselages for the initial wave of Lilium Jet models. Those aircraft will eventually be deployed for flight testing with EASA in order to prove to the regulator that the design is safe for commercial operations. The campaign is aiming to culminate in type certification of the Jet in 2025.

The delivery of the first fuselage aligns with Lilium’s previously stated target of Q4 2023. According to that roadmap, assembly of the first Jet is expected to start before year’s end, with crewed flights of the first model beginning in 2024. On Wednesday, the company said its suppliers are also ramping up production of parts and systems for the aircraft.

“To see the first aircraft fuselage on the final assembly line ready to join up with the canard and wings is a proud moment for everyone involved in our mission to make aviation sustainable,” said Klaus Roewe, CEO of Lilium. “We firmly believe the Lilium Jet will usher in a new era of sustainable regional mobility, offering the highest safety standards, as well as superior comfort, unit economics, and customer experience.”

The German manufacturer’s flagship aircraft is an all-electric seven-seater expected to fly advanced air mobility (AAM) routes between towns and inner cities, cruising at 162 knots on trips spanning 25 to 125 sm (22 to 109 nm).

The Jet differs a bit from its competitors, such as Archer Aviation’s Midnight, Overair’s Butterfly, or Joby Aviation’s air taxi. Those designs use a tiltrotor architecture—in which the rotors rotate when shifting between vertical and forward flight. By contrast, Lilium opted for 36 electric ducted fans embedded in the Jet’s wings, with no moving parts.

But like its air taxi rivals, Lilium plans to offer low-noise, zero-emission flights in densely populated areas, ferrying passengers over the congested streets below. In September, the company started building the first all-electric propulsion system for its initial models, also partnering with Japan’s Denso to ramp up production of the Jet’s electric engine. In addition, it extended its collaboration with Slovak battery maker InoBat to prepare for high-volume manufacturing.

In the next phase, engines will be integrated into the Jet’s aircraft propulsion mounting system—a flap structure that forms the rear part of the wings and front canards, designed and built by partner Aernnova—for further testing. The fuselage, meanwhile, will be joined with the wings and canards.

Lilium’s Wessling location comprises a testing and manufacturing center, propulsion and aerostructures facility, final assembly building, and newly built battery assembly building and logistics hub. The latter is where parts and components will be prepped for integration on the final assembly line.

Since receiving an initial certification basis for the Jet from EASA in 2020, Lilium has made steady progress toward commercialization.

Perhaps the biggest milestone was obtaining the DOA from EASA last month. The approval is essentially the regulator’s acknowledgment that a company meets the safety and regulatory standards required to produce EASA Part 21 aircraft that are fit to fly in shared airspace, as Lilium is seeking to do.

For manufacturers in the EU, DOA is a required step in type certification for aircraft developed under EASA’s special condition for VTOL (SC-VTOL) rules, which were designed as a standard for safe market entry globally. Lilium’s was awarded six years after the firm first applied for the rigorous process, and it establishes that the company is authorized to design and hold a type certificate for its aircraft.

“In simple terms, the DOA is our license to operate and confirms that Lilium has the organization, procedures, competencies, resources, and demonstrated rigor required to design and certify aircraft according to the very highest safety standards,” said Alastair McIntosh, chief technology officer and head of design organization at Lilium, last month.

In another update in July, the company said its means of compliance proposal—which outlines how it plans to adhere to the requirements laid out in its certification basis—was almost 80 percent approved by EASA. Means of compliance is another key requirement that will enable future flight testing.

Simultaneously, Lilium is working to certify the Jet in the U.S. The German manufacturer is the first and only eVTOL air taxi company with certification bases from both EASA and the FAA, setting it up for commercial launches in both markets in a few years. It plans to leverage the Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement between the two agencies to accelerate the process on the U.S. side.

In October, Lilium laid more groundwork to bring its aircraft to the American market. Through a partnership with Houston-based EMCJet, a full-service aircraft brokerage and management firm, it will deliver five Pioneer Edition Jets—each billed at a hefty $10 million—to be sold to private customers nationwide.

The Pioneer Edition is the four-seat planned launch edition of the full-scale Jet, aimed at wealthy GA and business aviation operators. According to Lilium, it will be the first aircraft of its kind available for private sale in the U.S. A total of 50 are expected to be delivered globally, including to buyers in the Middle East, the U.K., and mainland Europe.

According to Matthew Broffman, head of Lilium partnerships and network for the Americas, the rollout of the Pioneer Edition will be an appetizer for the larger Jet and a key step in the company’s path to market.

“Disruptions in products, and specifically transportation, are best done when starting with the premium market,” Broffman told FLYING in October. “In the 1930s, it cost half the price of a car to purchase a ticket to fly from coast to coast. Tesla didn’t launch with the Model 3, but instead the $100,000 Roadster, and even the first refrigerator cost more than $10,000 in today’s dollars.”

After selling to the premium segment and introducing flyers to AAM, Lilium intends to roll out the six-passenger Jet to airlines, brokers, and charter operators for air taxi services around the world—including in South Florida. Outside the U.S., it has aircraft orders from operators in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and China, where manufacturer EHang recently earned the world’s first eVTOL type certificate.

1144709995,20231206,"With a Euro 48.5 million contribution from the European Union (EU) received through its Humanitarian Aid department (ECHO), WFP was able to respond to the severe food crisis in eight countries of West and Central Africa during the 2023 hunger gap and beyond.

Food insecurity has reached a 10-year high in West and Central Africa with over 47 million women, men and children unable to meet their basic food and nutrition needs between June and September 2023. In conflict-affected areas of Burkina Faso and Mali over 45,000 faced catastrophic hunger - one step away from famine - during the June-August lean season. During this period stocks from the previous harvest run out leaving families to face food shortages. Malnutrition rates have also surged, with 16.5 million children under 5 set to be acutely malnourished this year – an 83 percent rise from the 2015-2022 average.

In response to this unprecedented hunger crisis, the EU played an instrumental role, mobilizing additional funding across multiple regions and continents to support WFP’s food assistance programmes with a particular focus on people living in conflict-affected areas, refugees, newly displaced people, food insecure families with malnourished children under 5, pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls. In West and Central Africa, the EU contributions helped WFP provide vital food assistance to 3.4 million people in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Nigeria.

“These generous EU contributions supported our programmes in eight countries throughout 2023 — especially during the lean season when needs soar,” said WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain. “It’s no secret that 2023 brought severe funding shortfalls to humanitarian work, which is why last year’s contribution was so vital to sustaining our efforts to save and change lives this year. The EU is one of our top partners and continues to step up to support vulnerable communities worldwide in the fight against hunger.”

Millions of people are living on a knife’s edge in the Sahel region due to a dangerous mix of conflict, forced displacement, acute food insecurity and climate change,” said European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič. “In the face of today’s unprecedented crisis, with record levels of hunger but difficult access to communities, the EU stepped up to help WFP reach the people most in need with vital assistance.”

Overall, in 2023, WFP targeted 11.6 million people – out of 19.2 million people in humanitarian need – in Burkina Faso, Chad, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and north-eastern Nigeria with emergency food and nutrition assistance during the lean season.

In a context of continuously increasing needs, WFP in the West and Central Africa region requires USD 976.6 million to ensure continued operations over the next six months. This includes USD 743 million urgently required for the crisis response."

1144717361,20231206,"With the onset of winter and ongoing Russian Federation attacks on critical infrastructure, Ukrainians are facing a worsening humanitarian situation and limited access to basic services, the Security Council heard today in a meeting focusing on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

Miroslav Jenča, Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and Americas, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, said that winter’s arrival and intensifying Russian Federation attacks on the country’s energy facilities “are worsening the dire humanitarian conditions across the country”. He noted daily reports of attacks on Ukraine’s critical civilian infrastructure, many resulting in civilian casualties, and an escalation of strikes on populated areas.

""Much like last year, the year 2023 has been devastating for the people of Ukraine,” he said, adding, “if urgent steps are not taken to reverse this trajectory, next year may be even more unpredictable and destructive.” He underscored that the lasting impact of the war on Ukrainian’s mental health will “be felt for decades” and the consequences of disruptions to children’s access to basic health and education will last for years. He highlighted the Russian Federation attacks on grain production and export facilities as well as the need to secure nuclear power sites.

Also briefing, Ramesh Rajasingham, Director of the Coordination Division, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said millions of Ukrainians are facing the prospect of another winter of severe hardship amid the impact of increased attacks on hospitals, electricity transmission systems, and gas and water supplies. “The deaths, injuries and level of destruction of vital civilian infrastructure is staggering,” he said. Many people have been left without access to heat, electricity and water, particularly in the east and south. “Amid freezing temperatures, this damage is particularly threatening the survival of the most vulnerable,” he added.

He highlighted the delivery of critical humanitarian aid so far this year, despite limited humanitarian access across the frontline. The Ukraine Humanitarian Response Plan has a “still substantial” $1.6 billion shortfall. Continued financial support is vital to sustain humanitarian operations into 2024 and as long as civilians endure the war’s terrible toll, he said.

In the ensuing debate, speakers noted the importance of humanitarian access in particular to Russian Federation-occupied areas, along with the targeting of civilian infrastructure, and global impacts, including on shipping of food supplies. Switzerland’s delegate was concerned at the lack of humanitarian access to Russian Federation-controlled Ukrainian territories, despite the immense need. Denmark’s representative urged full, unhindered humanitarian access, including to occupied areas.

The delegate of the United States recalled that, in 2022, the Russian Federation sought to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. “As we head to another cold winter, we expect that Russia will try again,” he said. He noted that Moscow has been undermining maritime security by threatening international shipping and attacking maritime infrastructure and pointed to daily drone attacks on Ukraine’s ports and grain facilities. A resumption of the Black Sea Initiative should be reconsidered to serve as a credible and meaningful step towards dialogue for the greater good, Mozambique’s delegate said. He added that political negotiations and confidence-building measures are crucial and urgent, and emphasized the need for a constructive approach focusing on mutual benefits.

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said, “intentional attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure add to the growing evidence of war crimes,” as reported by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. “Russia and its leadership must be held fully accountable.” The Union is intensifying the provision of humanitarian and civil protection assistance to Ukraine, including equipment such as power generators and mobile heating stations, as people face winter.

The representative of the Russian Federation said it is curious that Western countries “are still continuing to pump taxpayers’ money into a terribly corrupt criminal Kyiv regime”. If Ukrainians really are in such a ghastly situation, as our Western countries say, then Kyiv would not be able to export grain to countries in such enormous quantities, he said.

Ukraine’s delegate highlighted the execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war. He emphasized that the return and repatriation of Ukrainian children who were illegally deported or forcibly displaced by Moscow remains one of the most pressing challenges. He announced that an inaugural meeting of the International Coalition of Countries for the Return of Ukrainian Children will be held in Kyiv on 8 December.

MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AND SECURITY OF UKRAINE

MIROSLAV JENČA, Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and Americas, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, highlighted that the arrival of winter in Ukraine and intensifying Russian Federation attacks on the country’s energy facilities “are worsening the dire humanitarian conditions across the country”. He noted daily reports of attacks on Ukraine’s critical civilian infrastructure, many resulting in civilian casualties. Since the war’s start, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has verified 10,065 civilians killed and 18,679 injured. “The actual figures are likely considerably higher.” Most civilian casualties were caused by shelling and multiple-launch rocket systems in areas near the front line, however, attacks have recently escalated on populated areas nationwide. He noted that, on 25 November, Kyiv came under the most significant drone attack in months. Explosive remnants of war and mines continue to have a significant impact on civilians and their livelihoods, more so in rural areas and agricultural lands. Those killed 31 people and injured 98 since August. “All attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop immediately. They are prohibited under international humanitarian law and are simply unacceptable,” he said.

He noted that 10 million people have been forced to flee their homes, including 3.7 million internally displaced. “The full lasting toll of this devastating war on the civilian population is beyond measure,” he said. The war’s impact on Ukrainian’s mental health will be felt for decades. Children face major disruptions in access to basic health and education, which will impact their lives for years. Only half the 3.9 million children in the territory under Ukraine’s control have attended school in person full-time since the start of the school year. Women in Ukraine face a heightened risk of sexual and gender-based violence. Increased poverty rates caused by the war also affect women more than men, who face a greater amount of domestic and unpaid care work due to family separation, lack of childcare facilities and school closures. And most front-line workers, volunteers and first responders in Ukraine are women.

All four of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants remain at risk, he said. On Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant — Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, located dangerously close to the front line — suffered a complete off-site power outage. This was the eighth time since the start of the invasion. Last Wednesday, the IAEA team at the Khmelnitsky Nuclear Power Plant in western Ukraine reported hearing several explosions close to the plant. The plant was not directly affected. “All nuclear sites must be able to operate safely and must be protected to avoid potentially catastrophic consequences.”

“Despite the reports of increasing shipments in the Black Sea, the war continues to pose significant risks to civilian navigation and to Ukraine’s grain export capacity,” he went on. Since 11 July, OHCHR has recorded 32 attacks that damaged or destroyed grain production and export facilities in the territory of Ukraine under Ukrainian control. Russian Federation attacks hit port facilities, grain silos and vehicles for transporting grain. Most were in the Odessa region, where the Black Sea and Danube River ports are located. These attacks substantially reduced Ukraine’s capacity to export food. With so many facilities damaged, and export routes curtailed, the cost of logistics is rising. ""Much like last year, the year 2023 has been devastating for the people of Ukraine. If urgent steps are not taken to reverse this trajectory, next year may be even more unpredictable and destructive.” He called for Member States to lay the groundwork for peace.

RAMESH RAJASINGHAM, Director of the Coordination Division, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, speaking via videoconference on behalf of the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, said civilians in Ukraine continue to pay a heavy price for this war. Millions of children, women and men are now faced with the prospect of yet another winter of severe hardship amid the impact of increased attacks on hospitals, electricity transmission systems, and gas and water supplies. “The deaths, injuries and level of destruction of vital civilian infrastructure is staggering,” he said. Many people have been left without access to heat, electricity and water, particularly in the east and south. “Amid freezing temperatures, this damage is particularly threatening the survival of the most vulnerable,” including the elderly and those with disabilities, who are already suffering because of disruption to essential services caused by the war, he added.

International humanitarian law is very clear, stating that attacks must never be directed against civilians or civilian objects and constant care must be taken to spare them at all times, he said. He noted that, so far in 2023, almost 560 humanitarian partners, the majority local organizations, have provided life-critical aid and protection services to more than 10 million people. In recent weeks, humanitarians have provided more than 361,000 people with some form of direct winter assistance, including winter heating, repair and maintenance of energy and heating systems and much-needed home repair materials. Similar efforts continue across Ukraine. Last week, a landmark 100th interagency convoy for 2023 reached Chasiv Yar. Throughout the year, these convoys have provided critical assistance to almost 400,000 people in hard-hit front-line communities, substantially buttressed by deliveries from smaller individual organizations, despite a lack of humanitarian access across the front line, he said. He underscored that, under international humanitarian law, humanitarian access must be allowed and facilitated for all civilians in need, no matter where they live.

He highlighted that a major concern for front-line communities is landmines and other unexploded ordnance, which are “causing tragic avoidable casualties and significantly hindering community recovery”. Humanitarian mine action is critical to prevent further civilian casualties, especially among children, he added. On financing, he said the Ukraine Humanitarian Response Plan has received $2.3 billion of the $3.9 billion required in 2023, “but the $1.6 billion shortfall is still substantial”. He said continued financial support is critical to sustain humanitarian operations to the end of 2023, into 2024, and while civilians endure the war’s terrible toll.

Despite continued attacks, exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports through new corridors announced in August have steadily increased, he said. The UN estimates that some 7 million metric tons of commodities have been transported through these corridors, of which around 70 per cent are understood to be grains and other foodstuffs. With other routes, the overall volume of foodstuffs exported from Ukraine last month was comparable to November 2022, he noted. However, significant risks due to air strikes and sea mines remain, and Ukraine’s deep-sea ports continue to operate significantly below their potential capacity. High levels of agricultural exports from the Russian Federation continue, primarily via the Black Sea. Last month, the Russian Federation reported the transport of a first tranche of a total 200,000 metric tons of grain donations pledged to six African countries. He said it is imperative to ensure all sources of food exports are safely and sustainably connected to global supply chains, which the Secretary-General actively supports. While attacks continue, so will devastation, misery and ripple effects globally, he said.

NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said that, as the Russian Federation continues its war of aggression against Ukraine for a second winter, flouting international humanitarian law, structural and humanitarian costs are rising. Worse, drone strikes are decimating civilian infrastructure, leaving civilians vulnerable to glacial winter temperatures. Last winter, more than 12 million people were left without electricity. Calling on the Russian Federation to allow humanitarian access to the regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, he lamented that it continues to hold world food security hostage by pulling out of the Black Sea Initiative and attacking food infrastructure in Ukraine. France will continue to support grain exports through the “Grain from Ukraine” initiative, as well as a €3 million contribution to facilitate grain delivery to countries impacted by the food crisis, including Sudan, Somalia and Yemen. France also will continue to stand by Ukraine as it exercises its legitimate right to defence.

ROBERT A. WOOD (United States) said that, since February 2022, the Russian Federation’s war of aggression has resulted in the death of more than 10,000 people and caused a humanitarian crisis with consequences far beyond Europe. “Russia hopes people will believe their lies if repeated [so] much,” he stressed, underscoring that, to end the war, Moscow must cease its aggression and withdraw from Ukraine’s internationally recognized territories. Recalling that, in 2022, the Russian Federation sought to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, he added: “As we head to another cold winter, we expect that Russia will try again.” He noted that Moscow has been undermining maritime security by threatening international shipping and attacking maritime infrastructure, also pointing to daily drone attacks on Ukraine’s ports and grain facilities. Due to its disregard for safety and freedom of the seas, the Russian Federation has failed to be re-elected to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Council since 1960, he added.

ALBANA DAUTLLARI (Albania) said the impact of Moscow’s unjustified military aggression is on a scale beyond what Europe has seen this century. Millions of people do not have access to basic services, including water, electricity and heating, while food supplies are running low. “With no prospect to ending this war, we fear that millions of people will remain internally displaced in Ukraine in 2024, with close to 6 million refugees outside the country.” A total of 512 children have been killed and more than 1,152 injured in Ukraine since the Russian Federation’s invasion started. Moscow has forcibly transferred up to 1.6 million Ukrainian refugees to the Russian Federation. “Forcible transfers are a war crime under international law.” She commended Ukraine’s efforts to continue exporting grain. “Russia must stop the war it started without any justification, it must stop its aggression that is deliberately destroying its neighbor,” she stated.

GENG SHUANG (China) called for the international community and humanitarian agencies to step up their relief efforts to help people in conflict areas survive the winter in Ukraine. He noted the negative impact of geopolitical conflicts on the global economy. He said the prolongation of the war “is not in the interests of any party”. The international community should make joint efforts to minimize the negative spillover effects of this crisis to maintain global food energy and financial security, and ensure the stability and smooth flow of global industrial and supply chains. He said his country stands on the side of peace and dialogue, and calls for peace talks to end the war. His country will continue to work with all parties for a political settlement, he added.

MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said that millions of people in Ukraine are in need of humanitarian aid, while of the $3.9 billion required, only $2.2 billion has been received. Thus, 44 per cent of funding still needs to be found to cover current needs. “It is important to recall that war is not something that operates in a legal vacuum. Warring parties are obliged to uphold their commitments pursuant to international humanitarian law,” he said, expressing alarm by the attacks against health-care infrastructure, educational establishments and agricultural facilities. Such attacks are unacceptable. It is urgent to increase the protection of energy facilities, he said, citing an interruption in the power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which narrowly avoided a fatal catastrophe. All parties should invest in the search for a diplomatic solution.

ADRIAN DOMINIK HAURI (Switzerland) said it is essential to continue supporting humanitarian actions and early recovery projects in Ukraine. Nearly 18 million people depend on them, with the oncoming winter and renewed Russian Federation attacks on essential infrastructure having a major impact. He expressed concern at the lack of humanitarian access to Russian Federation-controlled Ukrainian territories, despite an immense need. Switzerland is contributing to the UN's Winter Response Plan, providing winter aid. He called for the protection of civilians, with at least 10,000 already killed since February 2022. He highlighted ongoing Russian Federation air strikes and daily reports of attacks on civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. He said food security in Ukraine and worldwide must be strengthened. He welcomed President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's ""Grain from Ukraine"" initiative, the Black Sea humanitarian corridor, and the UN's efforts for unhindered exports, stressing the importance of the European Union-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes. “Humanitarian efforts, the protection of civilians and global food security must be at the top of the international agenda,” he said.

SÉRGIO FRANÇA DANESE (Brazil), expressing concern over the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and continued loss of civilian lives, stressed that all parties should de-escalate hostilities and prioritize civilian protection. Noting that the conflict directly impacts international food security by disrupting major grain supplies, he urged the parties to ensure the safe passage of grain exports. He also expressed support for the resumption of the Black Sea Initiative as a critical step in mitigating food-security risks. Welcoming efforts towards the search for peace, he called on the countries concerned to engage in pragmatic negotiations with the support of third parties. “Brazil believes that there is always room for peace,” he said, underscoring that, through concerted actions, the international community can and should play a decisive role in guiding the parties towards a peaceful solution.

BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that over 17 million Ukrainians need humanitarian assistance, as the Russian Federation targets the country’s civilian infrastructure during winter. She commended the work of Ukrainian organizations and volunteer networks providing life-saving humanitarian support. “Russia continues to deny and block humanitarian access to millions of Ukrainians living in the territories temporarily under Russia’s control,” she said, calling on the Russian Federation to comply fully with its obligations under international humanitarian law. She welcomed a maritime corridor in the Black Sea, which has enabled Ukraine to supply 5 million tons of grain to global markets. Stressing that the Russian Federation has caused humanitarian suffering through its invasion of Ukraine, she urged Moscow to end its war now by withdrawing from Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory.

CAROLYN ABENA ANIMA OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana), noting that, as the situation in the Middle East commands global attention, the prevailing conditions in Ukraine require the international community’s undiminished support to “help turn the bend from the ravages of war to a constructive engagement for the peace”. Concerned over the persisting military contestations across many front lines, she said that winter conditions have minimized the coping capacity of affected populations, especially, women, young children, the aged and the sick. “All sides must endeavour to comply with the principles of distinction, proportionality and military necessity to avoid causing harm to innocent people,” she said, adding that violence is not the answer and the time to end the war is past due. Only through diplomacy and dialogue will a lasting and comprehensive settlement be found.

DOMINGOS ESTÊVÃO FERNANDES (Mozambique) said “the primary outcome of this conflict is the enormous human suffering”, including internal displacement and food insecurity. The conflict is a serious threat to international peace and security, he added. Sadly, the possibility for peace becomes increasingly illusionary the longer the conflict persists, he said. Adding that the situation on the ground worsens with local, regional and international impacts, he stressed that a military solution is not viable. Violence against civilians, restrictions on freedom of movement and economic decline are all putting huge strains on common capacities. He highlighted that the economic situation is dire and winter will bring more challenges. A resumption of the Black Sea Grain Initiative should be reconsidered to serve as a credible and meaningful step towards dialogue for the greater good. He said political negotiations and confidence-building measures are crucial and urgent, emphasizing the need for a constructive approach focusing on mutual benefits.

YAMANAKA OSAMU (Japan), noting that the Russian Federation’s attacks against energy facilities could force civilians to make difficult choices between “warmth and other essential services” throughout the coming months, stressed: “We cannot tolerate weaponizing winter again.” Recalling that, in September, Japan provided two autotransformers to Ukraine, he said that it plans to provide 10 more to reinforce power supply. The country is also aiming to provide three gas turbines by the end of 2023, with two more in the procurement process, he added, observing that these autotransformers and gas turbines will benefit 5.5 million Ukrainians. Also noting that the civilian death toll has exceeded 10,000, including more than 560 children, he added: “Why do we have to observe such a grim milestone? Why did those innocent people have to die?” Without Moscow’s war of aggression, the Council would not have to face these questions, he said.

DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) underscored his country’s fundamental disagreement with the excessive number of delegations at the Security Council meeting. Just two speeches by the European Union and Ukraine would be enough, he said, as was wisely done by the Chinese presidency in November. He said this meeting, called by Western countries, is cynical because these very countries are stubbornly not seeing the unfolding real humanitarian disaster caused by Israel in the Gaza Strip. He also said that, in April 2022, then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the head of American Pentagon, Lloyd Austin, managed to dissuade the head of the Kyiv regime to sign an already initialled draft peace agreement with the Russian Federation. “As recognized by the former German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the former French President [François] Hollande, they armed Ukraine and prepared it for war with Russia under the cover of the Minsk agreements for seven years.” Continuing, he cited Ukrainian media reports about a group of 17-year-olds from an orphanage, who were trained, supposedly, to be used exclusively in rear areas, but one of them died at the frontline. “In a word, Zelenskyy and his lapdogs are developing a kind of “Hitler Youth,” just like the head of the Third Reich did before his inevitable ghastly end in May 1945,” he said. “It is curious as to when Western colleagues will recognize this; they are still continuing to pump taxpayers’ money into a terribly corrupt criminal Kyiv regime,” he noted. If Ukrainians really are in such a ghastly situation, as our Western countries are saying, then Kyiv would not be able to export grain to countries in such enormous quantities, he concluded.

FRANCESCA MARIA GATT (Malta) condemned the Russian Federation’s recent attack on Kherson and said that its war of aggression against Ukraine continues to aggravate global food security, with one in five Ukrainian families facing hunger. Recalling that the export of Ukrainian grain cargoes to countries of Asia, Africa and Europe has been reduced by almost 3 million tons per month, she said this is exacerbating the worldwide food crisis. “There have been threats to attack cargo vessels in the ports of the Black Sea,” she said, adding that these actions significantly jeopardize the safety of maritime transportation and hinder commercial activities. She urged Moscow to fully comply with its international obligations, ensure the freedom of navigation in the Black Sea and cease all hostilities in hopes of securing a just and lasting peace.

SHAHD JAMAL YOUSUF IBRAHIM MATAR (United Arab Emirates), spotlighting consequences of the war in Ukraine, expressed concern about the long-term repercussions of the conflict, especially on children. Some 3,800 educational buildings have been destroyed or damaged, she said, lamenting that an entire generation’s right to education is threatened. Also voicing concern over attacks on health facilities near the front lines, she noted that more than half the attacks targeting health care facilities globally between 2022 and October 2023 occurred in Ukraine. With attacks on health facilities in Gaza, that number will continue to rise, she added, calling on all parties to conflict worldwide to comply with international humanitarian law. “The suffering of civilians has exceeded what can be tolerated or contained,” she said, stressing the urgency of finding a path to peace in Ukraine and other conflict-affected countries worldwide through dialogue and political solutions. Her country urges all parties to cooperate in ending the war, thus restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty.

JOSÉ JAVIER DE LA GASCA LOPEZDOMINGUEZ (Ecuador), Council President for December, speaking in his national capacity, called on the parties to protect humanitarian workers and on the Russian Federation to facilitate safe humanitarian access in the areas under its temporary occupation, even more so as winter approaches and the population suffers from a lack of access to basic services, including water, sanitation and health services. Regrettably, attacks on grain infrastructure have increased. He also is concerned about the situation of girls and boys, those fleeing war, displaced or refugees, and those who living with daily violence, without access to health and education services, which will be exacerbated by winter. He called for upholding the rights of minors who were transferred and for their return to be facilitated. He urged the Council to reiterate its support for the work of the Secretary-General on the humanitarian level and for peace.

SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said that, since the beginning of the large-scale invasion on his country, more than 114,000 violations of laws and customs of war on Ukraine’s territory have been documented. Highlighting the execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war, he drew attention to the massacre in the penal colony of Olenivka in July 2022. “Putin’s envoy tried to shift the responsibility for this crime onto Ukraine’s soldiers,” he noted, pointing to the “typical propagandistic refrain about Ukrainians killing Ukrainians”. Noting that the Russian Federation is stepping up its bombing, he reported that, on 25 November, it used 75 Iranian drones and one Kh-59 missile. He also recalled that, on 30 November, Moscow attacked the municipality of Novogrodivka and two other villages in the Donetsk region with six S-300 missiles that destroyed a residential building and caused casualties. Over a period of 11 months in 2023, 59,000 shelling incidents have been reported in 24 regions of Ukraine, causing 2,000 dead and 11 injured.

Emphasizing that the return and repatriation of Ukrainian children who were illegally deported or forcibly displaced by Moscow continues to be one of the most pressing challenges, he announced that an inaugural meeting of the International Coalition of Countries for the Return of Ukrainian Children will be held in Kyiv on 8 December. He also noted that the “presence of Putin’s Russia” in the Security Council has turned the effectiveness of the international framework into a common challenge, adding: “It gives Russia more power to instigate conflicts in various countries.” In this regard, he called for the “resignation of the aggressor State” to “detoxify the working environment”. “The time has come for a serious debate regarding the presence of Putin’s delegate in this Chamber.”

CHRISTINA MARKUS LASSEN (Denmark) speaking also on behalf of Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, said that Moscow’s war of aggression against Ukraine continues to cause immeasurable suffering. She called for full, unhindered humanitarian access to Ukraine, including to areas occupied by the Russian Federation. Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law. Welcoming the “Grain from Ukraine” initiative, she reaffirmed the Nordic countries’ support for humanitarian food assistance globally. The group reaffirms its strongest condemnation of Moscow’s war in Ukraine, she said, lamenting that a permanent Council member is waging an illegal war, producing serious consequences worldwide and challenging the Council’s legitimacy. The countries support Ukraine’s Peace Formula, she said, welcoming global support for a just, lasting peace in the country. “Russia must immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders” she concluded.

JOANNA SYLWIA SKOCZEK (Poland), aligning herself with the European Union, emphasized that, for almost 10 years, Ukraine has contended with the Russian Federation’s aggression, which has resulted in mounting civilian casualties and enormous material destruction. “We deplore Russia’s attacks and call for accountability for violations of international law committed in Ukraine by the Russian Federation,” she said. Her country has become the main support gateway for Ukraine, she added, as over 17.6 million people there need various forms of humanitarian assistance, since Moscow’s aggression has turned Ukrainians from suppliers to recipients of aid. Poland has supported Ukraine since the beginning of the war and will continue to do so, by hosting and providing support to the biggest community of Ukrainian refugees; operating as a hub for transferring international humanitarian aid through its land border with Ukraine; and delivering humanitarian aid directly in Ukraine.

HEDDA SAMSON, Deputy Head of Delegation of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said the Russian Federation’s targeting of Ukrainian critical infrastructure is unacceptable and must stop, as must its ongoing systematic air strikes against civilian objects. “Such intentional attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure add to the growing evidence of war crimes,” as reported by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. “Russia and its leadership must be held fully accountable,” she said. The Union is intensifying the provision of humanitarian and civil protection assistance to Ukraine, including equipment such as power generators and mobile heating stations, as people face winter.

She condemned the destruction and illegal appropriation by the Russian Federation of agricultural production in Ukraine. In response, the European Union has stepped up its aid, providing 785 million euros in support of those most vulnerable in Ukraine, especially in hard-to-reach areas. She stressed the importance of security, stability and freedom of navigation in the Black Sea, which is vital for sustainable food exports. She supports all efforts to facilitate exports of Ukraine’s grain and other agricultural products to the countries most in need, notably in Africa and the Middle East. The Union is enhancing its Solidarity Lanes to facilitate transit and export via land and maritime routes to world markets.

SANITA PAVĻUTA-DESLANDES (Latvia), also speaking on behalf of Estonia and Lithuania, strongly condemned the Russian Federation’s war of aggression against Ukraine, calling on it to immediately withdraw its troops and military equipment from Ukraine’s entire territory. “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, enabled by Belarus, is a flagrant violation of the UN Charter and international law,” she stressed, adding that violations by Moscow create mistrust and doubt about the credibility and effectiveness of the UN and the international rules-based system. She also called for the establishment of a special international tribunal to ensure justice, as impunity for war crimes cannot be tolerated. Recalling increased shelling of Ukrainian civilians and attempts to destroy civilian infrastructure, she spotlighted the largest drone attack launched on Kyiv in a six-hour air raid on 25 November 2023, using 75 Shahed drones. “Drones caused serious damage and electricity line shutdowns while the winter is setting in,” she emphasized, adding that, on the same day, the world commemorated the ninetieth anniversary of Holodomor, the man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933, honouring all victims of this artificially provoked hunger.

“Today we are witnessing once again Russia's crimes against the Ukrainian people by using food as a weapon,” she said, referring to Moscow’s shelling of Ukrainian grain storage, energy infrastructure and trade routes, as well as contaminating Ukrainian agricultural land and blatantly stealing Ukrainian grain. Such acts have a global impact, as the shortage of Ukrainian produce is particularly felt by countries facing food insecurity. The three Baltic States affirm solidarity with Ukraine and readiness to support it politically, economically, financially and militarily for as long as it takes, she stressed, urging the international community to stand together against Moscow’s attack on the principles and norms of the international law.

Police arrested Jose Alejandro Zamora Yrala, director of aircraft parts supplier AOG Technics, at his London home yesterday morning.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and National Crime Agency (NCA) launched an investigation into the business after bogus components were found in planes.

The company has been in business since 2015 and supplied parts for CF56, the world’s best-selling passenger aircraft engine.

But the firm is accused of providing fake authentication certificates, raising concerns over safety.

SFO director Nick Ephgrave said: ‘This investigation deals with very serious allegations of fraud involving the supply of aircraft parts, the consequences of which are potentially far-reaching.’

He said the SFO would be ‘vigorous’ with its investigation and ‘establish the facts as swiftly as possible’.

Ephgrave told Bloomberg: ‘We are now going through front doors, making arrests and seizing properties.’

AOG Technics could not be contacted for comment.

Last week Ryanair became the latest airline to confirm dodgy parts had been found in two of its planes.

The discovery was made during maintenance checks carried out in Texas and Brazil in the past few months. The parts, which were found in two of Ryanair’s Boeing planes, have been removed, the company said.

US carriers Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have become caught up in the scandal which has resulted in planes being grounded.

The SFO investigation is the first criminal action since regulators were alerted to fake parts found in Boeing and Airbus planes earlier this year.

Aviation watchdogs traced the supplies back to AOG Technics, an obscure London-based firm. Regulators in the UK, US and Europe accused the company of supplying engine parts with faked certification documents.

The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority announced in August that it was ‘investigating the supply of a large number of suspect unapproved parts’ that could be traced back to AOG Technics.

It issued a safety notice warning airlines that some of the parts were used in engines fitted in UK planes. Operators and owners were told to investigate their records for parts bought directly or indirectly from the firm.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency also said in August that it was examining reports of parts with suspected falsified documents.

The US Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines about the scandal and Bloomberg has reported that the US Justice Department is in the early stages of a probe."

Andriy Yermak said he had spoken to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto about a possible meeting between Zelenskyy and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - after Orban and his party publicly opposed starting membership talks.

Yermak, writing on Telegram, said the two had agreed ""to work on setting a suitable date for such a meeting.""

Unanimous approval at an EU summit next week is needed to proceed with membership talks for Ukraine and Moldova, a former Soviet republic, as recommended by the European Commission. Kyiv sees EU membership as a key step, 21 months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, of moving closer to the West.

Yermak, currently in Washington with a Ukrainian delegation discussing U.S. aid to Kyiv, said Ukraine ""was counting on a positive decision"" from the EU meeting.

He said lawmakers in Kyiv would consider in the coming days legislation critical to Ukraine's membership bid. ""We are fulfilling our obligations in full,"" Yermak wrote.

Orban has warned that EU leaders could fail to reach a consensus on starting membership talks with Ukraine and said the issue should not be put on the summit's agenda.

Distrust of Orban is high in Brussels after run-ins during his 13 years in power over the rights of gay people and migrants and tighter state controls over academics, the courts and media. Billions of euros of EU funds for Hungary have been frozen.

A parliamentary resolution from his ruling Fidesz party on Monday said EU expansion ""should remain an objective process based on rules and performance.

""The start of membership talks with Ukraine should be based on a consensus among European Union member states... The conditions for this are not present today.""

Fidesz said EU leaders should thoroughly assess how Ukraine's possible membership would affect cohesion and agricultural policies within the bloc, of which the EU's poorer members, including Hungary, are among the main beneficiaries.

An inflow of Ukrainian grains into the EU triggered protests from farmers in Eastern Europe last year, while Polish truckers have blockaded border crossings with Ukraine, calling on the EU to restore permits limiting transit for Ukrainian competitors.

Orban will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Thursday, ahead of the summit, his press chief said.

""Orban has committed to a very public strategy of creating chaos and panic ahead of the EU Council Summit. The spectacle he is producing is designed to create stress and maximize his leverage before EU leaders meet,"" said Roger Hilton, a research fellow at GLOBSEC, a think tank.

Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko was prevented from leaving the country last week, with the SBU security service saying Russia intended to exploit a meeting he had planned with Orban to hurt Kyiv's interests."

Under the new measures, the countries will ban non-industrial diamonds from Russia by January and Russian diamonds sold by third countries from March, according to a joint statement released after the meeting.

On the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, the leaders said ""more effective action"" is needed to limit the displacement of mass numbers of civilians and expressed support for more pauses in the fighting to get more aid in.

""More urgent action is needed to address the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and minimize civilian casualties,"" they said. Israeli forces have killed at least 16,016 Palestinians since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, which killed 1,200 people, according to Palestinian and Israeli authorities.

The leaders also planned to tighten controls on Russia's use of the international financial system and to impose more sanctions to enforce a price cap on Russian oil.

The measures came as Biden pleaded with Congress to fund his weeks-old request for billions of dollars more in Ukraine assistance, saying it was an ""urgent responsibility"" and would keep U.S. allies behind Ukraine. The U.S. plans to announce $175 million in additional military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, according to a U.S. official.

During the meeting, Zelenskiy called for continued support for Ukraine.

""Russia believes that America and Europe will show weakness and will not maintain support for Ukraine at the proper level. Putin believes that the free world will not fully enforce its own sanctions,"" he said, according to remarks posted to the president's website.

""The free world vitally needs to maintain its consolidation, maintain interaction, maintain support for those whose freedom is being attacked.""

The G7 members, comprising Japan, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and the European Union, pledged in May to restrict exports to Russia that could fund its war effort in Ukraine.

A statement issued at the time said the restrictions would cover exports of industrial machinery, tools and technology and it would also try to limit Russian revenues from trade in metals and diamonds.

Western nations have admitted that the impact of their $60 price cap on Russian crude oil has waned one year in, and the countries have been looking at ways to strengthen implementation.

1144793536,20231207,"THE Department of Correctional Services (DCS) is challenging a research paper about the situation within the island's prisons presented by human rights organisation Stand up for Jamaica (SUFJ) on Wednesday, which highlighted several barriers to justice for inmates.

At the launch of the paper, entitled 'Justice for All', held at The University of the West Indies (UWI) Regional Headquarters in St Andrew, Mona, director of medical services at the DCS Dr Donna Royer Powe ripped into the paper, arguing that it did not present an accurate picture of the situation within penal institutions.

""I'm very, very passionate. I've been there 18 years and a lot of people there do a lot of hard work, and I don't like to see things that don't totally represent us and the reality on the ground,"" she said.

Dr Royer Powe was first out of the blocks in challenging the data after it was presented by researcher Jennifer Jones. Dr Royer Powe took task with the fact that only six people were interviewed for the study.

""I don't think it is fair to the department or to the other 3,000 and something inmates to use this as their voice. Six former inmates represent less than one per cent of the inmate population, so that is not a true reflection of what might be happening,"" she said.

She also questioned the fact that no time span was given in terms of when these ex-inmates were actually incarcerated and when the interviews were done.

""You are presenting these 'facts' in 2023. I have been with the department for 18 years. So some of these things, I don't know if they happened 20 years ago or 10 years ago but they're not the current situation,"" she argued.

The paper, which was launched with the support of the European Union, looked in some detail at the experiences of six former inmates — four males aged between 30 to early 50s, and two females, aged 43 and 48.

They were selected by SUFJ for their ability to articulate their thoughts and experiences and as inmates involved in the skills training programmes run and funded by SUFJ.

In addition, two prominent and experienced human rights lawyers were interviewed. The researcher said an attempt was made to interview the director of corrections or a senior representative ""but unfortunately this was not possible"".

The study pointed out that there are several barriers to accessing justice in Jamaica. These include socio-economic disparities, a strained legal structure, economic obstacles, high legal costs, limited legal aid services and shortage of legal professionals.

The researcher said that for persons in rural areas, the geographic distribution of legal resources also poses difficulties for those individuals. Additionally, the researcher said there is a need for ongoing efforts to enhance legal literacy and awareness among the custodial population, empowering them to navigate the legal system effectively.

Further, Dr Royer Powe drilled into a specific area of the study which focused on prisoners who have no attorney including the late 81-year-old Noel Chambers who died in 2020 after spending 40 years in prison awaiting trial for murder. According to an Independent Commission of Investigations (INDECOM) report, Chambers was initially deemed unfit to plead. He was eventually declared fit to plead, but the case never made it back to court.

She pointed out that after Chambers' death, measures have been put in place to address the issue of mentally ill people who are unfit to plead, including the building of an infirmary in 2021.

""So we have tried to correct things that were highlighted. We knew we had some shortfalls and an infirmary was retrofitted where we have hospital beds, we have now employed psychiatric nursing aides, psychiatric aides, nursing aides on a 24-hour basis. So we've employed about 12 persons who are put on 24-hour shifts, three of them on at a time to provide nursing care for inmates, which we never had before,"" she said.

Further, in terms of inmates who are kept in the department, who are on the court's pleasure, Dr Royer Powe said it is something she has been trying to address for the past 18 years she has been at the department.

""The Department of Correctional Services cannot take an inmate to court. Whether we know they're there 50 years and their case has just come up, we cannot just take them to the court. You must have a date…it is not our problem. It's a problem in Jamaica in terms of the legal system, and how it is connected,"" she said.

""So something is missing in the connection because we do the fitness to plead for the inmates. But even if they're fit to plead, the psychiatrist can't walk with them to court because which court is waiting or expecting them and you mentioned if they do not have a lawyer to advocate for them, there's no way they're going to court. So this thing of persons being lost…we can never lose anybody, every day a roster is done. We know exactly that we have 1,700 inmates at Tower Street and if one is missing, nobody is going home, we have to stay and check until we find that one inmate, so we've never lost anybody,"" she said.

She further noted that in addressing the mental health situation in penal institutions, in 2020, the DCS got approval for 11 psychiatrists.

""We currently have four full time and three sessional. It's not because of lack of advertising, but UWI is not producing the number of psychiatrists we need and then when we get them we don't have the space. So we have a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a doctor fighting for the one office in an institution. So they have to be rotating. We actually have a full-time gynaecologist as well,"" she said.

In response, executive director for SUFJ Carla Gullotta said the interviews were done in the last six months ""so they are not old"", arguing that the DCS should not be on the defensive.

""I [don't think] that you need to be on self-defence because this is not something which is accusing DCS. It is something which is asking for DCS to receive better treatment. You have been highlighting how many difficulties you face every day. My question is, can we help? We can. Can we advocate for you? We can. We know that for the correctional officer, it is very difficult sometimes to speak out because he might lose his job.""

""So our intention and our willingness is that we have been learning on the ground the difficulties and recognise them and note them. When you say that there are four psychiatrists for 4,000 inmates, is it enough? So can we ask for more? Can we try to require that a new prison is built? Our cry is for better service, not only for the inmate, but also better living conditions for [staff],"" she said."

At that time, the bridge between Bonfim, Brazil, and Lethem was still under construction. We got to the Guyanese border by a little boat. We traveled afterwards for 500 kms to Georgetown for many hours, crossing the beautiful savannahs and Amerindian villages, on very difficult dirt roads. We started to discover a new and dazzling land, full of beauty, landscapes and diversity, completely different to all of Latin America.

Because that’s the fact that the dictator Maduro seems to not understand: Guyana is not Latin, it is Caribbean, and thank the Lord it is. A proud Guyanese could never be Venezuelan, no matter the citizenship you offer. We all know, of course, the true reasons about your neighbour satrap is doing this unacceptable “referendum”. He consumed all Venezuelan oil and sources and needs more. Would be a pity to see how a beautiful nation as Guyana is consumed by an evil Bolivarian experiment. Everybody knows how it ends, wherever it happens. In that order, l prefer to silence also my opinion about the languid attitude of the ICJ in this case.

I still can say, with humility, that I’m one of the Chilean journalists who most knows about Guyana, even Surinam and the French Guiana (where I’ve been too). Three extraordinary, but still unknown, territories in almost all of the southern continent. I still remember when I was interviewed on Guyanese television by the great businessman Yesu Persaud (RIP), who was very interested in our trip and why, finally, the press of a big country in the region, Chile, was suddenly interested in your tiny diamond, your land. I could share with him a lot of impressions and I still remember the vibrancy, love and conviction on the future of Guyana in Mr. Persaud’s eyes. He was completely right.

Guyana is one of my favorite countries (I have been in many), and I can’t wait for the moment to come back. This is a battle that the tyrant cannot win. You have our support, the support of most countries in South America, the support of the European Union, United States and UK. And many others.

1144817047,20231207,"Lloyd Austin, the US Defense Secretary, threatened Congress over aid for Ukraine. Austin said that if Congress does not appropriate $61 billion in aid for Ukraine it is “very likely” US troops on the ground in Europe will be fighting Russia.

Republican Senators walked out of the briefing after twenty minutes.

What is behind this threat is the notion that Russia, after it finishes with Ukraine, will launch attacks in Europe.

Objectively there is no evidence that Russia threatens anyone in Europe even though a lot of Russians think they should. After all, Europe is providing massive military aid, intelligence and technical help to Ukraine in the war with Russia, along with training Ukrainian troops and helping Ukraine develop its war plans. Stocks of European weapons, meant for NATO defense, have been shipped to Kiev. Most of them won’t be replaced for decades, if ever.

From Russia’s point of view the real land grabber is NATO. After all, despite Russia’s warnings and promises made to Russia that were blatantly violated, NATO expanded in the Balkans and in Eastern Europe. (The Russians were frequently assured, starting with former President Bill Clinton, that NATO would not expand.)

Expansion has meant arming the new NATO members with top quality western weapons, building bases for NATO on their territories, and threatening Russia directly. One of the reasons Russia took over most of Eastern Europe at the end of World War 2 was to create a security buffer. It was not the only reason, of course, as the Russians were anxious to get hold of resources in these countries. One recalls that Russia suffered huge devastation and depopulation thanks to the Nazis and their allies.

None of this means Russia would not like to get back what they lost to NATO’s expansion after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And, yes, it is quite true that Russia’s Special Military Operation can be regarded as a land grab in Ukraine.

There is little sign that Russia intends any expansion in Eastern Europe or the Baltic States and virtually no intelligence of any kind supporting the Austin invasion thesis. If there was any concrete intelligence you can safely bet the Biden administration would let Congress know (especially when they have their hands out for more money for the war).

There are three reasons that support the opposite hypothesis, namely that Russia has no intention of expanding outside of the Ukraine conflict area.

The first reason is behavioral. With NATO’s war stocks at an all time low, Russia could have taken advantage of this vulnerability and moved its forces against NATO targets, for example NATO operations in Poland or in the Balkans. Yet the Russians have exercised unprecedented restraint and even tolerated aggressive intelligence flights and NATO naval exercises in the Black Sea, an extraordinarily sensitive Russian security worry. The Black Sea is not only the back door to Ukraine, it is also a way to challenge Russia itself.

Russia even exercised restraint when Ukraine used drones to hit an airfield inside Russia where nuclear bombers are based. Two of these bombers were either damaged or destroyed. Such an attack needed intelligence support from NATO, primarily the US, and the Russians no doubt understood that quite well. Yet the Russians tolerated the attack to a degree and took no steps to widen the conflict.

There is some evidence that the attack on the Soltsy-2 airbase was launched by the Ukrainians from Estonia, as Ukrainian drones did not have the range to reach the airbase.

Other examples of Russian restraint include the sinking or Russia’s flagship Moskva with US help, multiple attempts to destroy the Kerch Strait bridge from Russia to Crimea, and multiple attacks on Moscow, including an attempt to hit Putin’s Kremlin office in what Russia says was an attempt to assassinate Putin.

The second reason for Russia’s reluctance to expand the conflict is that doing so would be immensely costly. Russia has already learned just how expensive the Ukraine war is, even though they are finally winning the war after nearly two years of fighting. But a war in Europe means that US and European fighter aircraft and bombers would add to Russia’s misery, even if NATO ground forces would have significant problems according to a RAND study.

The greatest cost for Russia is manpower and casualties from the war. Figuring out actual casualties is difficult, because both the Ukrainians and Russians either don’t tell the truth or say nothing. Yet the fact that Russia needs to step up its military recruiting, and that Russia has filled gaps with prisoners, says that the war has taken many lives. It also means that the war’s popularity in Russia may be threatened if the killed and wounded numbers grow too high. It is hard to believe Russia would crank up a bigger war, given the impact on manpower. Nor would the war keep the support of the Russian people, who know how to oppose a conflict when it starts to bite them at home. That’s what forced Russia to leave Afghanistan starting their withdrawal in May, 1988 (completed in February, 19890. That wasn’t enough to save Gorbachev, prevent an attempted coup, and lead to the disintegration of the USSR.

The third reason that speaks against Russia expanding the conflict is the unanticipated wild card caused by western sanctions on Russia.

In effect, with Putin’s Special Military Operation in Ukraine, NATO and many other countries aligned with the United States or with the European Union, imposed heavy sanctions on Russia. This drove Russia into the arms of China, and forced Russia to rethink its future. Above all it meant a realignment of Russia’s resources, trade and monetary system away from Europe and the west. This is a decisive new factor that changes the strategic roadmap for Russia. It directly undermines the argument that Russia has something to gain from any attack on Europe. The truth is that the Russians are less and less interested in Europe or the United States. One can safely say that the extra-legal western sanctions were a major strategic blunder for NATO and its partners and friends, as well as for the EU.

Even if a peace deal is made with Ukraine and Europe and the US lift sanctions on Russia, it is probably too late to recover from the damage done to any future ties. Russia won’t reject trade with the west, but it is likely to make business deals only on its own terms. It is unlikely Russia will again allow western companies to operate inside Russia, and it will increasingly team with China for technology and weapons development. In short, the west filed for divorce and the Russians accepted the final decree.

The Austin argument is, for the above reasons, false and misleading.

When the Republicans walked out of the secret briefing staged for the Senate to try and sell them on supporting more money for Ukraine, many argued that the Biden administration’s arguments were stale and unconvincing. The Biden effort to intimidate the Senate simply didn’t work.

1144824156,20231207,"President Xi Jinping said on Thursday that relations between China and the European Union matter to the peace, stability and prosperity of the world, and he called on both sides to be partners of mutually beneficial cooperation.

Xi made the remarks during a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing with President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, both of whom are in Beijing for the 24th China-EU Summit to be held on Thursday.

Xi said that since the end of last year, China-EU relations have shown a good momentum of consolidation and development, which is in line with the interests and expectations of both sides.

Against the backdrop that the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, China and the EU, as two major forces promoting multipolarity, two major markets supporting globalization, and two major civilizations advocating diversity, have the responsibility to jointly provide greater stability to the world, inject more impetus into global development, and play a greater role in leading and supporting the global governance, he said.

Xi urged both sides to continuously enhance political mutual trust, consolidate strategic consensus, expand common interests, eliminate various disturbances, and enhance dialogue and cooperation for the benefit of the people of both sides.

He also underlined the need for both sides to jointly address global challenges and promote world stability and prosperity."

Washington, Dec. 6 (CNA) The G7 leading industrial nations issued a statement Wednesday reaffirming the ""importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"" to ""security and prosperity in the international community.""

The leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States and the European Union issued the joint statement following a virtual meeting, which was also attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The statement added that the G7 opposed any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the region by force or coercion.

In addition, the G7 voiced concerns over China's human rights record, ""including in Tibet and Xinjiang where forced labor is of major concern to us.""

The statement said that while the G7 was ready to build stable relations with Beijing, it opposed militarization activities in the South China Sea.

The statement said there was ""no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea.""

The statement added that a July 12, 2016 ruling rendered by a tribunal constituted under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was a ""significant milestone"" and ""legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings.""

Taiwan has rejected the 2016 ruling, which downgraded the legal status of Taiping Island, maintaining that it is ""not legally binding on the Republic of China."""

1144833732,20231207,"BEIJING — (AP) — The leaders of China and the European Union held talks Thursday that focused on their disputes over trade, subsidies and a deep divide over the war in Ukraine.

Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Beijing with the two European presidents, Ursula von der Leyen from the EU Commission and Charles Michel from the EU Council.

The European Union is calling on China to improve market access to address an annual trade imbalance of more than $200 billion between the two sides.

China is unhappy with EU restrictions on technology exports and an EU investigation into subsides for electric vehicles. The EU has also urged China to use its influence with Russia to help bring an end to the Ukraine conflict.

Von der Leyen said the two sides need to manage their differences responsibly.

“China is the EU’s most important trading partner,” von der Leyen said in opening remarks posted on the commission's website. “But there are clear imbalances and differences that we must address.”

Xi said that China and the EU should handle their differences through dialogue, and pushed back against what his government sees as a shift in European policy on China toward a more strident and competitive approach.

The two sides “should not regard each other as rivals because of different systems, reduce cooperation because of competition, and confront each other because of differences,” he said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

The meeting comes a day after EU member Italy announced it was withdrawing from Xi's signature ""Belt and Road"" initiative that aims to build a global network of Chinese-financed roads, ports and power plants.

Italy became the first G7 country to sign on to the initiative in 2019, when the government at the time promoted it as a way of increasing trade with China while getting investments in major infrastructure projects.

Neither outcome materialized. In the intervening years, Italy’s trade deficit with China has ballooned from 20 billion euros to 48 billion euros ($21.5 billion to $51.8 billion.)

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin defended the initiative and appeared to imply that Italy had been influenced by forces hostile to China.

“China firmly opposes smearing and undermining cooperation in building the Belt and Road and opposes stoking bloc confrontation and divisions” Wang said at a daily briefing Thursday.

After nearly three years of self-imposed isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic that took a heavy toll on its economy, and having adopted an assertive foreign policy that seeks to challenge the U.S.-led world order, China now appears to be taking a slightly more moderate tone.

Xi held four hours of talks with U.S. President Joe Biden last month in California in their first face-to-face meeting in a year, with the leaders vowing to stabilize their fraught relationship.

Von der Leyen and Michel, the president of the EU Council, met Xi in the morning and later held talks with China's No. 2 leader, Premier Li Qiang. Von der Leyen, as commission president, heads the day-to-day business of the EU, while Michel chairs the summits of EU leaders.

Von der Leyen said the two sides had an “intense discussion on the topic of trade imbalance and the root causes,"" citing in part a slowdown in the Chinese economy, which is reducing domestic demand and prompting companies to divert their products to the European market.

“We agreed that we have now a list of different elements where we want to deep dive together in the high-level dialogue. This is important, first of all on our side to show the evidence but secondly then also to seek concrete results on the ground,” she said.

“It is important that the sides have a frank and open relationship and that we have stable trade relations with each other,” von der Leyen said.

The talks were “candid, frank, in-depth and constructive,” Wang Lutong, director general of the Foreign Ministry's European Department, told reporters. He repeated China's call for an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine and the opening of talks between Western leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin. China says it is neutral in the conflict but has heavily criticized NATO and the West for allegedly provoking Putin and refused to criticize Russia's actions.

Dialogue on human rights, economic cooperation, people-to-people exchanges, open trade, the environment, food security and China's claim to Taiwan were also discussed, Wang said.

The European Union is calling on China to improve market access for products from its 27 member countries to address an annual trade imbalance of more than the massive trade imbalance. China exported $458.5 billion worth of goods to the EU in the first 11 months of this year and imported $257.8 billion, according to Chinese customs data released Thursday.

The EU has angered China by launching an investigation into the latter's subsidies for electric vehicles to determine whether they give manufacturers in China an unfair competitive advantage in European markets.

“China has never deliberately pursued a trade surplus,” spokesperson Wang said ahead of the summit. He noted recent import and supply chain expos that he said encourage foreign companies to sell to the Chinese market of 1.4 billion people.

Wang also took aim at possible EU restrictions on technology exports to China. “I’m afraid it’s unreasonable if the EU imposes strict restrictions on the export of high-tech products to China while expecting a significant increase in exports to China,” he said.

The EU is looking for better market access for a range of products including cosmetics, infant formula, wine and other alcoholic beverages.

China has angered the EU by taking a neutral stance in what most European countries see as a Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. The EU is calling on China to use its influence with Russia to end the invasion, ensure that exports from or via China are not aiding Russia's war effort and support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace formula. .

Von der Leyen said the EU and China have global responsibilities as major powers and a shared interest in peace and security.

“That is why it is essential to put an end to the Russian aggression against Ukraine and establish a just and lasting peace consistent with the U.N. Charter,” she said.

Xi said China and the EU should promote political settlements of international hot-spot issues, according to CCTV, which did not include any specific mention of the wars in Ukraine or Gaza.

Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, addressed the proposed EU ban on diamond imports from Russia, part of a new sanctions package related to the war in Ukraine. Peskov stated: “As a rule, it turns out that a boomerang effect is partially triggered: the interests of the Europeans themselves suffer. So far, we have been able to find ways to minimize the negative consequences of sanctions.”

According to EU diplomatic sources, the discussed proposal involves banning direct diamond imports from Russia starting January 1, with plans to implement a traceability mechanism from March onwards, preventing imports of Russian gems processed in third countries.

European Union diplomats have strongly criticized the Kimberley Process for its failure to take action against Russia. They expressed concern that the organization’s inability to reach an agreement on this issue “casts a shadow on its ability to stay fit for purpose and address challenges affecting its core mandate,” IDEX Online reports.

In a strongly worded statement released on November 22, the European External Action Service (EEAS), the diplomatic service of the EU, expressed its disappointment with the Kimberley Process’s failure to consider the consequences of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine for the global rough diamond sector. The statement also criticized the lack of progress made in the past year towards adopting a broader definition of conflict diamonds that would encompass those produced by Russia.

The EEAS statement said: “We regret that, despite the substantial revenues generated by Russia’s diamond exports and the Kimberley Process’ core mandate to sever the link between the diamond trade and conflict, consensus could not be reached to include an agenda item and discuss the matter.”"

We draw on insights from many individuals about their experiences and other constructive ways to live together with our differences. How can intersectional thinking improve our laws?”

Undergraduates and postgraduates were invited to submit essays answering the prompt, with the winners being awarded a $750 scholarship and the ability to participate in the dialogue. The panel was moderated by Christos Kypraios from the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, who was joined by Professor Robin Fretwell-Wilson and Professor Jonathen Herring along with the winners of the competition, Cameron Samuel Keys, Hertford College, and Almas Shaikh, Lady Margaret Hall.

The discussion centred around how intersectional thought could be used to improve laws. The panellists discussed the value of being able to categorise the ways people faced oppression as well as the importance of understanding that assuming that all people of similar characteristics are affected in the same way will lead to ineffective laws. A $250 prize was awarded for one member of the audience who asked a question.

Tolerance Means Dialogues is an organisation, based in the USA, led by Professor Wilson, which runs competitions to facilitate discussions about tolerance in universities in America and Europe. The undergraduate and postgraduate winning essays are published below.

My grandmother left Sri Lanka in 1965 to start her life in England. 51 years later I was shocked to discover that she had voted to leave the European Union, primarily because she viewed levels of migration as too high. I was even more shocked to discover that in 2017, she, a lifelong Labour voter, voted for the Tories, because she feared a Corbyn government. It took me a long time to comprehend her decisions. Simply put, I viewed her as an immigrant and a person of colour and didn’t understand why her politics didn’t match. I tell this story to illustrate how the modern view of intersectionality places individuals in boxes built around their personal characteristics rather than considering how different parts of their identity impact their unique experience of the world. The modern view has departed significantly from the ideas set out by Kimberlé Crenshaw and bell hooks. I will conclude that while intersectionality can improve our law by providing an alternative to ‘a single story’, this is contingent on a return to a traditional conception of the term.

In her 1989 article, Crenshaw coined the term intersectionality to explain why feminism was failing to address the concerns of black women. In short, the inability to consider the cumulative impacts of sex and race, which she argues are greater than the sum of their parts, meant that feminism in its current form would continue to largely address the needs of white middle-class women. hooks developed this theory, notably stating that “I will not have my life narrowed down. I will not bow down to somebody else’s whim or to someone else’s ignorance.” This statement encapsulates what was meant by intersectionality, that every person is impacted by the nuances of their life, and a failure to understand means a failure to create impactful change.

The modern view of intersectionality focuses far more on a person’s identity. This can be seen in the coverage of Suella Braverman’s firing as Home Secretary. In the BBC’s summary of her political career, they make consistent reference to the fact she is the daughter of migrants, contrasting this with her political stance on the level of migration to the UK. Similarly, in the 2020 US presidential campaign Joe Biden said “’If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black’. This inability to reconcile identity with politics is a failure of the modern view of intersectionality and suggests a departure from a Crenshaw/hooks view of the term. Instead of viewing groups as whole people, it appears we are viewed as simply an extension of identifiable markers: being a daughter of migrants or a person of colour.

Fundamentally the value of intersectional thought is that it forces us to view individuals as complex, conflicted and often confusing people whose views do not necessarily line up with our view of their ‘identities’. Tolerance, if nothing else, must mean tolerance of others who do not act or think or see the world in the way we expect them to. Unless the law recognises what Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie calls the ‘danger of a single story’, intersectional thought will not be able to improve our laws, instead further sowing the division and friction it aims to undo.

Tolerance is often relegated to the backseat in a legal context. The word conjures images of begrudgingly enduring oppositional values, instead of wholehearted acceptance of different strands of thought. As a lawyer and a law student who is constantly grappling with concepts of equality and dignity on a regular basis, tolerance has been low on my radar of legal and personal values. Why do I need to rely on tolerance, when principles of equality, dignity and other rights would serve a better purpose? However, through the years, I have realised that a naive dependence on only legal concepts such as equality, liberty or dignity has severely limited application without a bona fide application of tolerance. I, therefore, argue that tolerance carries immense value in the form of fraternity, solidarity and dialogue.

Dr Ambedkar, a legal philosopher and key draftsman of India’s Constitution evaluated the value of fraternity: “Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things. It would require a constable to enforce them.” Nevertheless, there cannot be a complete realisation of fraternity without tolerance. Fraternity is a way to relate and bring together plurality of opinions. Without a tolerant approach, fraternity’s goal of pluralism would break down. Tolerance is, thus, a subterranean value that upholds fraternity.

Similarly, fraternity cannot be practiced in vacuum. It goes hand-in-hand with solidarity – whether it is jurisprudential, institutional and community-based. Solidarity is an important legal principle which recognises the social value of sharing human experiences. Within the European Union, Prof. Guido Alpa argues that solidarity is a normative principle, endowed with philosophical and moral significance, which can be used to realise socio-economic rights. Solidarity is buttressed with tolerance – an understanding that despite the myriad encounters among different groups and individuals, our humanity is a bigger shared goal that needs to be upheld and respected.

Using fraternity and solidarity together ensures open dialogue. United Nations has recognised that promoting fraternity and solidarity is bolstered through dialogue. This provides an antidote to hate and divisive rhetoric; to censorship and violations of free speech and expression. We need tolerance in receiving and reciprocating different, often opposing, ideas. It provides the space to exchange viewpoints, in the belief that they will be received in good faith.

Most confrontations could be solved outside the courtroom using tolerance – with a healthy dose of solidarity, fraternity and dialogue. Solidarity, fraternity and dialogue are important tools within law, morality and philosophy – however, none of these values will be half as strong without the underpinning of tolerance holding up these values.

Recognising tolerance as a legal value is also imperative to maintain the strength of tolerance.

It is not a mere idealistic vision, or an altruistic choice. It can be used to bridge relations, strengthen legal values and build a cohesive society. For me, tolerance means the ability to realise solidarity, fraternity and dialogue – the cornerstones of any democratic and liberal society."

1144874037,20231207,"NEW YORK (AFP): Sixty-nine million children — or more than one in five — live in poverty in the world’s 40 richest countries UNICEF said in a report released Wednesday, blasting Britain and France for their particularly bad standings.

That’s despite a drop in child poverty rates in the periods from 2012 to 2014 and 2019 to 2021, by around 8 percent in the 40 European Union and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) wealthy countries assessed.

“This is equivalent to around 6 million children out of a total child population of 291 million,” said UNICEF Innocenti, the United Nations agency’s research arm.

But at the end of 2021 there were still more than 69 million kids in poverty in those countries.

“For most children this means that they may grow up without enough nutritious food, clothes, school supplies or a warm place to call home,” said Bo Viktor Nylund of UNICEF Innocenti, highlighting the impact of such struggles on young people’s physical and mental health.

The UNICEF figure is based on relative poverty, which is around 60 percent of the national median income, often used in developed countries to establish their own poverty levels.

The report called for action to ensure children’s well-being and for political will among the countries surveyed, stressing that a country’s’ wealth did not automatically lift its children out of poverty.

Since 2012, the biggest setbacks have been seen in some of the richest countries.

Britain saw a 19.6 percent jump in child poverty — or half a million extra children, and France’s rate went up 10.4 percent.

In the United States, the number of poor children has fallen by 6.7 percent, but more than one child in four still lives in relative poverty.

And the poverty rate in 2019-2021 was twice as high as in Denmark, a country with a similar per-capita income.

Underlining the link between child poverty and economic inequality, the report also highlights the greater risk of poverty for children from single-parent families and minority backgrounds.

In the United States, 30 percent of African American children and 29 percent of Native American children live below the national poverty line, compared with only one-in-10 non-Hispanic white children.

In the EU, a child with parents of non-EU nationality is 2.4 times more likely to live in poverty."

1144914513,20231207,"The leader of Tibet’s exiled government accuses Chinese authorities of imposing monoculturalism on Tibetans, eradicating ethnic identities and suppressing political activities.

Penpa Tsering, the head of an India-based organization known as the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), which serves as Tibet's government-in-exile, has told DW that the latest round of ""back-channel"" negotiations with China, which are focused on a range of issues, including the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet, have been taking place since the start of 2023.

In an interview in Vienna, Tsering said the talks were still at an early stage, but stressed that both sides wanted to reestablish formal contact.

The statement is significant as formal talks between China's government and the CTA stalled in 2010. Tsering declined to name the officials involved in the talks.

Will the talks lead to a breakthrough?

After coming to power in 1949, China's Communist Party overthrew the Buddhist theocracy that was running Tibet in 1951.

Beijing says Tibet has been a part of China for many centuries, a claim the government uses to support its sovereignty over the territory. But many Tibetans reject China's claim, pointing to periods of history when Tibet enjoyed self-rule.

Following a failed uprising against China in 1959, the Dalai Lama, the head of the dominant school of Tibetan Buddhism, fled into exile. He has since been living in Dharamsala, a hillside city in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The CTA is also based in the city.

Beijing doesn't recognize the CTA and has denounced it and the Dalai Lama for ""attempting to separate Tibet from China.""

For years, Chinese authorities have also slammed the exiled spiritual leader as a ""separatist"" and a ""wolf in monk's robes."" But the Dalai Lama has repeatedly said he is only seeking genuine autonomy for Tibet, not separation from China.

Against this backdrop, Harsh V. Pant, professor of international relations at King's College London, said it would be very surprising if something came out of these talks.

""Such back-channel discussions in various forms have been going on for quite some time, but so far there has been nothing to show for them,"" he said.

Pant said Chinese President Xi Jinping, after opening several fronts at the global level, was now trying to take a step back.

""There has been a stronger-than-expected pushback from various global players and the Chinese economy is weakening, so Xi has an incentive to loosen up,"" he said. However, he added, ""it is highly unlikely that Tibet would be an area where Xi would do it.""

Many Tibetans fear that their Buddhist culture is at risk of erosion by Chinese political and economic domination.

Tsering recently visited the United States, Canada, Latin America and Europe to raise awareness about the human rights situation in Tibet.

He painted a grim picture of life there, accusing Chinese authorities of imposing monoculturalism on Tibetans, eradicating ethnic identities and suppressing political activities.

He also denounced Beijing for creating a constant state of fear through extensive surveillance, anti-espionage laws and the widespread collection of sensitive data, among other measures.

Furthermore, China is accused of running colonial-style boarding schools in Tibet, where children are separated from their families, from their culture, from their language and from their religion.

The United States even said in August it was imposing visa sanctions on Chinese officials for pursuing the ""forced assimilation"" of children in Tibet, where UN experts say 1 million children have been separated from their families.

Tsering said the Chinese government wanted to avoid ethnic conflict by assimilating young Tibetans.

""I think they are looking for a way to manage the situation in Tibet without losing face,” Tsering said. ""They know that the status quo is unsustainable.”

Who will have the say over the next Dalai Lama?

Tsering also spoke about the question of the Dalai Lama's succession.

He said the CTA was ""not concerned” about the Chinese government's attempts to control the process of selecting the successor.

The Dalai Lama, now 88, has already said he could break Buddhist tradition and pick his own reincarnation or declare the institution over, fearing that officially atheist Beijing would identify and groom a pliant successor.

Tsering said China's government ""does not believe in life after death"" and officials ""do not understand"" the Tibetan Buddhist concept of reincarnation.

""How can an atheist government which does not believe in religion be responsible for finding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama?"" he said.

Tsering also called for greater international support for the Tibetan cause, noting that the United States is the only country that has a law on Tibet, the Tibetan Policy and Support Act passed by the US Congress in 2020.

The legislation makes it official US policy that the succession of Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including the succession of the Dalai Lama, be left solely to Tibetan Buddhists to decide, without interference from China's government.

Stating that the European Union is ""fractured in many ways,"" Tsering urged the bloc to have a more uniform foreign and trade policy toward China.

Tsering said he was in regular contact with the about 150,000 Tibetans in diaspora communities worldwide. They represent just 2% of the overall Tibetan population. About 6.3 million Tibetans remain in China.

He said some Tibetans in exile were growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress in dialogue with the Chinese government.

Tsering remains ""hopeful"" for the future of the Tibetan cause.

""There is an unwavering spirit of Tibetans inside and outside Tibet,"" Tsering said, ""and we will never give up on our struggle.”"

Nigeria’s air force killed at least 85 civilians when it mistakenly bombed a religious gathering in the northern state of Kaduna. The government has been battling jihadists and armed groups of bandits, who have terrorised large parts of the north.

Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s autocratic president, held a referendum asking voters if they wanted to annex two-thirds of neighbouring Guyana, which has benefited from discoveries of huge oil reserves. The exercise was skewed in favour of a yes vote as there was no official “no” campaign. The electoral authority claimed that over 10m people voted, an unlikely figure, given that few were seen at polling-stations. Even so, Brazil sent troops and 16 armoured vehicles to the border with Venezuela.

Nayib Bukele stepped back from the presidency of El Salvador to campaign for elections in February. The country’s constitution bars a second consecutive term, but the Bukele-appointed Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that he could run again if he was out of the post for six months before the inauguration, which takes place on June 1st. Mr Bukele has left his secretary in charge.

Javier Milei, a libertarian economist who takes office as Argentina’s president on December 10th, selected most of his cabinet.

A special election will be held in his marginal Long Island district. Meanwhile Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted as speaker in October, said he would leave the House by the end of the year. He represents a safe Republican seat in California.

Republicans in the American Senate blocked a bill to provide more military support to Ukraine. The legislation became entangled in a row over migration, as the Republicans tied their support for the bill to stricter border measures, which Democrats rejected. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, cancelled a speech to Congress via video link amid the row. Before the vote the White House’s budget director warned that cutting aid would “kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield”.

Britain’s ruling Conservatives were embroiled in fresh turmoil, after the immigration minister resigned in protest against an emergency bill that classifies Rwanda as a safe country in order to send illegal migrants there. The minister said the bill did not go far enough in deterring migration; the government insisted it tackled the recent objections to the policy raised by Britain’s Supreme Court. Rumours swirled that the bill might turn into a confidence vote on the government."

1144928073,20231207,"Some asset managers are paying nearly three times as much as their peers for research from brokers and banks — for essentially identical service.

A new survey from Substantive Research reveals that there is a massive range in what managers are willing to pay for sell-side insights, but little clarity on market pricing.

“We’re trying to help people get an understanding of where they’re paying,” said Mike Carrodus, CEO of Substantive Research, a firm that compares investment research products. “You don’t want to be the meanest payer. You don’t want to be miles ahead of anyone else. It’s completely legitimate to pay for research with a value-driven overlay.”

The findings come at an important time: The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority is considering re-bundling investment research and execution costs -- five years after they were separated by MIFID II. Before the regulatory framework took effect, banks and brokers would charge fees to asset managers that included the price of their research. The European Union law required these banks and brokers to unbundle the research from their brokerage fees to bring transparency to the market.

MIFID II hasn’t exactly provided transparency, though. Managers are still naming their price on research — and it varies wildly.

Substantive Research surveyed 60 firms with total assets under management of more than $14 trillion to find out just how widely. Of those surveyed, 60 percent were based in Europe and the rest in North America.

Large asset managers are paying up to 190 percent more than their rivals for comparable research services from the same broker, according to the study. On average, the difference is 70 percent.

Smaller managers saw less deviation. Some paid 160 percent more than others, but the average differential was 45 percent.

Part of the answer lies in how this market operates. Managers set a budget for how much they’d like to spend on research, either by choosing an overall amount and portioning it out to the best available teams or by calculating a price based on analyst meetings and other perks provided.

By paying more, managers ostensibly get better services, such as more meetings with the brokerage analysts or having their calls picked up first by those teams. But there’s a limit to what researchers can provide above their baseline offerings.

When managers name prices that are too deemed low by the sell side, brokers rarely walk away. Instead, the brokers tell the managers they will receive “tier two service,” according to Carrodus. Most managers, he said, are willing to accept that.

Money managers don’t want to be too frugal for their own good when it comes to paying for investment research. But what has happened — in the absence of price transparency — is that some are vastly overpaying.

The cost differences tend to be more prevalent among bulge bracket and “premium” research-driven brokers, which had 60 percent ranges of pricing inconsistency. Meanwhile, niche sell-side firms had ranges of 49 percent.

“Every price is simply a product of a bilateral negotiation, which is why it’s been so difficult to understand what you should be paying,” Carrodus said."

1144937308,20231207,"The European Union has voiced concerns of a surge in migrants from Africa, after the ruling military junta in Niger repealed a law that had previously criminalized the transport of migrants in the country.

Known as Law 2015-36, the legislation was drafted in 2015 in coordination with the EU and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. At the time, Europe was facing a migrant crisis, as more than a million people entered the continent from Turkey and North Africa. The law was implemented the following year.

As part of the 2015 deal, the European Union pledged over $5 billion in aid to stabilize economies and governments in the Sahel region to stem the flow of migrants.

“These projects had a number of objectives, including combating illegal migration, improving public infrastructure, improving border capacity — but also assisting displaced populations,” explained Alia Fakhry, an expert on EU-Africa migration policy at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.

“One of these projects was the project that supported the Niger state to build its border capacity and to draft this new law that would criminalize irregular migration and its facilitation — the work of smugglers, basically. And it’s this law that’s now been revoked by the military junta,” Fakhry told VOA.

The EU said in September that 876 suspected people traffickers were prosecuted under the law from 2017 to 2023.

However, on July 26, Niger’s military ousted democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum in a coup. Junta leader General Abdourahamane Tchiani announced in November that the government was repealing the 2015 migrant law and said that all convictions under the legislation would be quashed.

Tchiani did not give a reason for the move, although observers say he is likely seeking to gain local support and retaliate against the EU’s decision to suspend aid payments following the coup.

Speaking to reporters in Brussels on November 28, Ylva Johansson, European commissioner for home affairs, voiced fears of a new influx of migrants.

“There is a huge risk that this will cause new deaths in the desert. That's the most concerning thing, but it would also probably mean more people coming to Libya, for example, and then maybe also trying to cross the Mediterranean today to the EU,” she said.

In a discussion paper published in September, the Council of the European Union had already expressed concerns over cooperation with the Nigerien military junta following the July 26 coup.

“Given Niger's role as a transit country, primarily through the Central Mediterranean route, as well as its status as a host country, it is crucial to direct our focus towards the aftermath of the events of 26 July,” the paper said.

“The risk of the instrumentalization of migration exists in theory — although there is no evidence for this right now — or of a halt to cooperation on migration and border management with the EU. Various scenarios are now possible regarding the evolution of migratory flows transiting through Niger. Besides, close attention must be paid to other countries of the area, such as Mauritania, in which there could be migratory consequences of the coup in Niger,” the paper said.

Critics say the 2015 law forced migrants to divert to more dangerous routes through the Sahara desert to try to reach Europe and exposed the migrants to abuses by the Nigerien security forces.

Local media report that the repeal of the law has been welcomed in Niger and that migrant traffickers are planning to resume operations. Its implementation in 2016 had devastated the local economy in migrant hubs such as Agadez, Fakhry said.

“A number of people simply went out of a job in the region,” said Fakhry. “So, smugglers, of course. People who were facilitating the travel and journey of migrants. But also, a bunch of people who benefited directly or indirectly from the presence of migrants. These are people who were preparing and selling food, people who were selling water, offering accommodation, any other kind of service to migrants.”

Before the law’s implementation, the Nigerien army had often accompanied migrant convoys through the desert and demanded their own cut of the profits.

“There might be an objective to return to the pre-2015 situation where migrant smuggling created revenues for the military and for the state,” Fakhry said.

Analysts say several factors will determine how quickly the migrant flows could resume, including the situation in the migrants’ countries of origin and in transit countries north of Niger. The EU and individual European states have struck deals with Tunisia and Libya to clamp down on irregular migration across the Mediterranean Sea."
1144943337,20231207,"Amid the dizzying displays of oil wealth and lofty visions of AI’s potential to save the planet at the United Nations-led global climate summit (COP28) happening now in Dubai, one neon-emblazoned sign stood out for its brutal honesty: “Act as if your house is on fire,” the conference pavilion display read, “because it is.” The words—co-opted from Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg’s famed speech to world leaders in Davos in 2019—have felt closer to home in Nova Scotia as of late. This year, we witnessed the province’s most devastating wildfire season on record: More than 25,000 hectares of land burned from Shelburne to Upper Tantallon. Two-hundred families lost their homes. Thousands more were forced to flee without knowing when—or if—they would be cleared to return.

Premier Tim Houston called Nova Scotia a “changed province” in the wildfires’ aftermath, adding that both the emotional and financial scars would “run deep” and take time to heal.

But as the province’s recovery time extends into years, another time window shrinks: The opportunity to act as Earth accelerates toward 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming from pre-industrial levels. Keeping under that threshold, most climate scientists agree, would shield us from the most brutal of climate futures. Beyond that limit, we invite catastrophe. More homes lost to floods. Crops and other species—whole ecosystems—would die. Global famines could spark. Thawing permafrost could reintroduce waves of infectious diseases.

The European Union’s climate-monitoring service, Copernicus, has already declared 2023 the hottest year on record. Between January and November, global average temperatures reached 1.46C above pre-industrial levels—and for the first time in recorded history, on Nov. 17 and 18, the Earth’s temperature briefly exceeded the two-degree threshold. That it happened on the eve of COP28 should send a “very clear message,” Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement. “The time for definitive action to tackle climate change is now.”

Nova Scotia—and much of Canada, for that matter—has followed a slightly different timeline: The province has targeted 2030 to phase out coal and reach an 80% renewable-energy power grid. Houston’s governing PC Party sees wind and solar as the key to meet those goals.

But is the province’s plan ambitious enough?

Like COP28’s host nation, Nova Scotia is among the world’s laggards when it comes to clean energy. (Though next to oil-rich Dubai, it might look shinier.) As of today, less than a quarter of our province’s power supply comes from wind, hydro, tidal and solar. (Only Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nunavut—which gets almost all of its energy from burning diesel—have lower scores for renewable power among Canada’s provinces and territories.) By contrast, Newfoundland and Labrador, PEI, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia and the Yukon each generate over 93% of their electricity from renewables.

Some of that divide can be explained by geography: BC, Quebec and the Yukon have towering mountain ranges and powerful river systems to harness. (A quarter of BC’s power comes from three dams on the Columbia River alone.) Manitoba has more than 100,000 lakes. Ontario has Niagara Falls.

Nova Scotia has had hydroelectric power “for decades,” says David Miller, director of Nova Scotia’s electricity policy and programs. Even so, hydro accounts for a mere eight percent of the province’s power supply—and it’s not likely to grow. That’s because “basically every river that could reasonably be dammed was dammed,” Miller told The Coast in June.

“We don’t have the elevation change or the big rivers that you get in Ontario, BC or Quebec. So wind was the other obvious solution—or tidal. And wind was much more commercially available.”

The federal government had hoped that Nova Scotia would meet its energy targets by committing to a so-called Atlantic Loop: A “high-capacity” transmission system that would deliver renewable energy from Hydro-Québec to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia while the provinces revamped their power grids. Then, one day, it would bring clean energy from Atlantic Canada back to Quebec and onward to markets in Ontario and the northeastern US.

But—as with almost all things these days—the cost has proven difficult to stomach. Nova Scotia’s government says it would cost $9 billion in infrastructure upgrades to bring power from Quebec into the province—a threefold increase in projected costs from 2020. Premier Houston told reporters in June that the Atlantic Loop had the “potential to bankrupt our province.”

That runs counter to what the federal Liberals have said. That same month, Central Nova MP Sean Fraser told reporters that his government saw the Loop as the “least costly option for households” as Nova Scotia weans itself off coal and oil.

“If there are alternative proposals that are [less] costly, of course we’re interested in hearing what they may be,"" he added. “But to date, by far the least-costly option that anyone has identified with something more than back-of-napkin math is the Atlantic Loop.”

In October, Nova Scotia’s natural resources and renewables minister Tory Rushton announced the province had made changes to its Electricity Act that would allow it to “quickly approve innovative energy storage projects” that would help “advance the use of batteries for storing excess renewable energy” and “exceed” the province’s goal of 80% renewable energy by 2030. On Dec. 1, Rushton followed that by announcing a “Green Choice Program” that would give large-scale customers—think companies like Michelin, or universities like Dalhousie—the option to source 100% of their power from renewables. The province expects the program could add 10% more renewable energy to the grid by 2027-28.

Nova Scotia’s government is bullish that it can, in fact, surpass its 80% target and end up closer to 88% by 2030. And that’s largely because of one reason, Miller says.

“Over the last four years that I’ve been in this role, renewables have gone from a premium product to the cheapest product,” he told The Coast in June. “And the issue isn’t, ‘Well, how many should we buy that are cost-effective?’ It’s ‘How many can we buy and work inside our system?’”

Even with cheaper costs converting the PC Party of Nova Scotia into clean energy boosters, there are other hurdles to overcome. For one thing, the province is growing—and Nova Scotia’s government has aggressive goals to double its population to two million by 2060. That puts additional strain on the power grid. (“The more energy we consume, the harder it is to decarbonize,” Miller says.) Then, there’s the matter of consistent supply—and that might be the thorniest bit. Solar power works great, Miller says, until the sun sets or the clouds arrive. Ditto for wind power until the gales go away. And that doesn’t work for systems that require steady power—like hospitals, for instance.

“The solution for Nova Scotia, in all futures, includes more wind, more solar, probably batteries and probably some investment in gas. And I think that’s going to be hard for people to understand how building fossil resources enables decarbonization.

“But the electricity system has to function—it is a matter of life or death for people, frankly… You can’t leave people in the cold in February.”

Some argue there’s a barrier to Nova Scotia meeting its energy goals that isn’t being touched. It boils down to ownership: The province doesn’t own its power supply, nor the network of cables and towers that connects homes from Yarmouth to Sydney—Emera does. And thanks to an agreement set by the province, it’s guaranteed an annual profit margin between 8.75% and 9.25%—never mind if thousands of Nova Scotians seem to lose power with each winter storm or heavy rainfall. Last year, Emera raked in $46 million in adjusted net income from owning Nova Scotia Power, per the company’s end-of-year financial disclosures.

Nova Scotia NDP leader Claudia Chender wonders why the provincial government doesn’t rewrite the agreement. In March 2022, she introduced a private member’s bill to direct the province to study the “advantages and disadvantages” of bringing Nova Scotia Power—either in whole or in part—back under public ownership.

“This government came to power telling people that they were going to do their homework, and that all options were on the table,” Chender told The Coast in February. “And so one of our responses to that was to say, ‘Great, here’s some homework. Let’s understand the ownership structure of our utility, what it is and what it could be, and how it would best serve Nova Scotians.’”

She believes there are “lots of reasons” why Nova Scotia might want to reassume control of its power grid—“particularly when it comes to adding more renewable energy to that grid and having an open competition for where that renewable energy comes from. Because right now, Nova Scotia Power really holds the keys to that kingdom.”

Chender isn’t alone in thinking there’s merit to the discussion. For more than a decade, policy analyst Christopher Majka has argued that the province should re-expropriate Nova Scotia Power’s network of cables and towers. (In 1972, under premier Gerald Regan, the provincial government bought out 90% of the former Nova Scotia Light and Power’s stock. The province owned the utility until 1992, when premier Donald Cameron’s cash-strapped government sold it off for $192 million—worth $361 million today.)

“[Nova Scotia Power] was sold to the private sector for no sound economic reason,” he told The Coast in February. The province, Majka notes, had billed the sale as a capital gain that would help to balance its books. Instead, it turned out to be a loss: The utility should have sold for $300 million in 1992—worth $564 million today.

Majka would like to see Nova Scotia reclaim control of its power network, if not the coal plants themselves. “To a large extent, those assets are rapidly diminishing in value, so there isn’t really any advantage for Nova Scotians to purchase those,” he says. Owning the network of cables across the province, on the other hand, opens up a realm of opportunities.

“They would allow us to make all kinds of decisions with respect to investments and also control what we do with those and how we develop them and make them better. And that would be done entirely on the basis of public interest, rather than private profit,” he told The Coast in February.

Case in point: Burying power lines underground. For Nova Scotia Power, the higher cost of putting lines underground doesn’t make sense when it comes to serving its shareholders, who want to see the highest rate of returns. But it makes a whole lot more sense in a province that wants to improve its power stability during fall and winter storms.

“We know from climate change that these events which we’ve experienced recently are certainly going to continue, and they’re certainly going to get more severe,” Majka argues. “And as much as we need to try and stop climate change, the horse is out of the barn… and we now also have to be thinking seriously about remediation.”

As convinced as Miller is about renewable energy’s future, the electricity policy and programs director has his doubts that expropriating Nova Scotia’s power grid would bring about swifter change.

“If Nova Scotia Power was a Crown [corporation], would they be substantially different? Maybe, but I’m not convinced that is actually the driver or the constraint on decarbonization,” he told The Coast. “I think that New Brunswick Power has behaved very similarly. I think utilities behave like utilities, generally, whether they’re publicly or privately held: They were not designed to rapidly change; they were designed to incrementally kind of move forward along a pathway.”

But there are other barriers that a privately-owned Nova Scotia Power poses to the government’s clean energy aims, Majka argues. Take, for instance, Nova Scotia Power’s influence on small-scale renewable energy producers. In January 2022, the utility company applied before the Utility and Review Board for a monthly fee for homeowners who sell power back to the grid—a move that drew sharp criticism from solar installers who said it would hamstring the growing industry.

“It will directly impact people’s decision to go solar. They basically won’t do it,” Renewly Solar Inc. owner Yohan Peiris told CTV News.

Houston’s government fixed that in April 2022 when it barred NSP from imposing fees on homeowners and businesses who install solar panels or wind turbines. But as the Halifax Examiner has reported, the provincial legislation still defers to NSP when it doesn’t need to: For one thing, advocates warn the province’s aims to help low-income families with their power bills accomplishes little without further amendments to the Public Utility Act.

Chender proposed such an amendment in a separate private member’s bill, also introduced in March 2022. It went into second reading last November. (Timberlea-Prospect MLA Iain Rankin supported the bill, calling it a “positive thing to broaden a mandate for the Utility and Review Board,” and saying it would “move the needle towards the public interests.” The bill faced stiffer opposition from the governing PC Party, whose MLA Kent Smith, representing Eastern Shore, said, “We’re not going to advance this piece of legislation in the exact way that the Opposition would prefer, but we have taken a multitude of steps to lower individuals’ power bills.”)

Chender has been diplomatic in her response to how her bills have been received.

“We’re still hoping that the government makes good on their promise of doing their homework,” she told The Coast in February.

“I really believe that people want power that is affordable, reliable and green,” she added. “And right now, we’re not really getting any of those.”

How much would it cost to re-publicize Nova Scotia’s power grid?

Majka is used to the reservations he hears when he talks about buying back Nova Scotia’s power network. There’s the usual kicker: How much would it cost? Surely, too much.

“Time and again, the objection has been we can’t afford it,” Majka tells The Coast. “We absolutely can.”



His answer: Issue government bonds. Instead of funding the purchase of Nova Scotia Power—in whole or in part—through its own coffers (i.e. taxes), the province could issue bonds to match the price tag. Those bonds would then come with a guaranteed rate of return over two years, or three years, or longer. (Any rate of return lower than 8% would “still be significantly less than the 9% profit margins of Nova Scotia Power,” Majka says.) Bondholders, in turn, would fund the utility’s purchase.

It’s a win-win, Majka believes: Taxpayers are off the hook for the project, the government takes back control of its power grid and bondholders get a decent return, to boot. Any excess revenue flows back into improving the province’s power grid, instead of going to private shareholders.

“Governments have that power to expropriate,” he says. “We could do it. All it requires is political will.”

In both February and December, The Coast reached out to Nova Scotia’s natural resources and renewables minister Tory Rushton’s office for comment on what options, if any, the province is exploring with respect to buying back part or all of NSP. Minister Rushton has not been made available for an interview.

In an emailed statement to The Coast, however, a provincial spokesperson says re-publicizing Nova Scotia Power is “not something we’re considering at the moment,” and that instead, the government is “strengthening performance standards for NSP” and “holding the utility more accountable for things like reliability.” (In 2020, CBC reporters tracked power outages “nearly every day of the year” in Nova Scotia, only missing two days. Nova Scotia Power had unplanned outages “every day,” they found. As of this writing—on a clear-skied Thursday—there are eight active outages across the province.)

For his part, Majka continues to rally against what he describes as “austerity politics” affecting Nova Scotia’s quality of living.

“Small government, little spending and privatization of public resources… you can get away with that for a certain amount of time,” he says, “but eventually it sort of catches up with you when the infrastructure starts to crumble.”"

Russia is the only member of OPEC+ which contributes to export cuts rather than production cuts as part of its participation in the group's agreement to curb supplies. Market analysts have struggled to verify the exact volumes of cuts achieved by Moscow.

Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin made the offer to provide more information last week in a call with six ship-tracking consultancies and price reporting agencies tasked by OPEC+ to work with Moscow on the issue, three sources told Reuters.

Sorokin told the firms - S&P Global Platts, Argus Media, Energy Intelligence, Wood Mackenzie, Rystad and Kpler – Moscow would provide more data on crude production, inventories and refinery fuel output to give a more comprehensive picture on its compliance, according to the sources, one of whom attended the meeting.

""Sorokin was trying to persuade the trackers that Russia fully complied with the deal,"" one of the sources said.

Details of the call, which took place on Nov. 28, have not been previously reported.

Sorokin did not respond to a request for comment.

Rystad said it was one of the secondary sources chosen by OPEC and its estimates were available for OPEC's research organization. Argus, Woodmac and Kpler declined to comment, while Energy Intelligence and S&P Global Platts have not immediately replied to requests for comment.

Russia has made its oil production and exports data classified since the West imposed sanctions on Moscow following the start of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022.

Russian officials have said the country should not reveal information that would make it easier for its foes in the West to monitor and sanction Russian shipments.

Russia is the world's second-largest oil and fuel exporter after Saudi Arabia with overall volumes of around 6-7 million bpd.

Tough task

Russian fuel exports were complex to tally even before they became a state secret as the country uses dozens of ports, rail terminals and border crossings to export many different fuels.

Russia has around 30 large and 80 small refineries, which together process over 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude.

OPEC+ delayed its meeting last week by several days to November 30 due to what sources said were disagreements over production levels by some members, including Nigeria and Angola. The group finally agreed to deepen cuts to around 6 million bpd or 6% of global output.

Under an earlier deal with OPEC+, Russia pledged to reduce its oil exports by 300,000 bpd until the end of 2023. The latest deal calls on Russia to additionally cut its fuel exports by 200,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2024.

Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said in an interview with Bloomberg that OPEC+ wanted more assurances from Moscow it would deliver on its pledge. He said Russia would be meeting with the ship tracking firms every month to provide data but gave no further detail.

Prince Abdulaziz said he would have preferred to see Russia cutting oil output rather than exports.

But he added he understood the challenges Russia was facing with cutting oil output in winter months because doing so in freezing temperatures can damage reservoirs.

The idea of export rather than production cuts was first publicly floated by Igor Sechin, the powerful head of Russian energy giant Rosneft and a long-standing ally of President Vladimir Putin, in June.

""OPEC itself had a poor track record of production discipline in the 1980s and 1990s,"" BCS Global Markets analyst Ronald Smith said, adding that Saudi had traditionally ""bore an outsized share of the burden of cutting production"".

""It is unsurprising that Saudi Arabia would be concerned with confirming that Russia, the second-largest member in OPEC+ by production, is producing and exporting the amount of oil it says it is,"" he added.

According to Reuters calculations, Russia's total oil products exports stood at 98.8 million metric tons, or round 2 million barrels per day, in January-November 2023.

After the European Union banned Russian fuel imports, Russia diverted Europe-bound exports of diesel and other fuels to Brazil, Turkey, North and West Africa and the Middle East.

Turkey and the Middle East, which have their own major refineries, have since become Europe's top fuel suppliers, often blending their own fuels with those from Russia or with refined products made from Russian oil."
1144993427,20231208,"THE Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has ruled that member states are permitted to ban workers from wearing religious symbols such as the hijab in public workplaces, in the interests of neutrality.

The ruling last week said that such bans were allowed, so as to “enforce an entirely neutral administrative environment”; but it said that there was an element of discretion for national courts, which should be able to decide how to balance the neutrality of the public service against the rights of the individual.

What was most important was that bans on clothing or religious symbols had to be applied consistently and evenly, the court ruled.

The court was asked to rule after the case of a woman from Belgium who launched a legal challenge after the municipality of Ans told her that she could not wear a headscarf at work. She argued that her right to freedom of religion had been infringed by her employer’s decision.

The municipality changed its terms of employment to say that employees had to observe strict neutrality, and could not wear sign any signs of religious affiliation.

But the complainant produced photographs to show that “discreet signs of conviction were tolerated”, including the wearing of earrings with a cross, or the holding of Christmas parties.

The court of Liège, in Belgium, asked the CJEU to decide whether the strict neutrality policy in workplaces amounted to discrimination.

The court ruled that a prohibition “of any sign revealing philosophical or religious beliefs . . . is not discriminatory if it is applied in a general and indiscriminate manner to all of that administration’s staff and is limited to what is strictly necessary”.

It also said that authorities in member states had some discretion in deciding what degree of neutrality they wanted to promote.

The ruling covers public-sector offices in the EU. In 2021, the court ruled that private-sector employers could limit the expression of religious, political, or philosophical beliefs when there was a “genuine need” to “present a neutral image towards customers or to prevent social dispute”.

In the UK, guidance from the Government says that employers must be flexible in their approach to religious symbols and dress, and employees should not be prevented from wearing crosses, head coverings, or other symbols, unless it directly interferes with their ability to carry out their duties.

France has had a ban on religious symbols, including headscarves, in state schools and government buildings, since 2004. It also announced this autumn a ban on female students’ wearing abayas — full-length robes — in state schools.

There is no doubt that Europe is leaning Right. National elections held in the Continent are bringing forth governments one by one, which can be called right-wing, but not fascist. The Netherlands has all but elected Geert Wilders, an unapologetic opponent of Islam. Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s rightwing and nationalist Prime Minister, is going strong; She has thrown out China’s BRI project and refuses to toe the European Union’s line on immigration. Emmanuel Macron of France, who began as a centrist is turning right, much to the consternation of that country’s socialists and leftists, while indications are that the far-right, anti-immigrant and anti-Islam Marine Le Pen might win France’s next elections. President Emmanuel Macron has often spoken of the need to build a “Europe that protects''.

In a landmark 2017 Sorbonne speech, he had also called for “a sovereign, united and democratic Europe”. Finland has a strong right-wing prime minister, Petteri Orpo, who is no friend of unrestricted immigration. Hungary under Viktor Orban has already called the European Union a dysfunctional arrangement and no longer obeys its diktats. Now Greece is throwing up rightwing politicians, who have opened their doors to Indian investments, but more importantly, Greece has stated that it will never be friends with India’s enemies. Much to everyone’s horror, the Alternative Fur Deutschland (AFD), a nationalist and right-wing German party is gaining ground in that country and might soon rule Deutschland. The AFD is reportedly a hard-right party opposed to the liberal and green environmentalist agendas of Germany’s conventional political parties, and also their liberal stance on immigrants coming into Germany. The days of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ‘welkuming’ policies towards Turkish and Middle Eastern migrants are now more or less over.

Whether the new rulers admit and say it or not, they have been elected in response to a dread of Islam. The fascists had captured power between the two World Wars, which itself had been a fearful response to the threat of communism.

In the context of World War II, Fascism/Nazism or class collaboration were conceptually appropriate to the growth of ideologies that propagated and promoted class conflict. Logically, the antidote to the fear of Islam should have been more and more influence of Christianity. Unfortunately, however, the grip of Christianity over the minds and hearts of Europeans, with the march of modernity and the progress of advanced learning and education, has dissipated. Education encourages thinking, and a thinking individual does not accept any assertion without research or survey, preferably of an empirical nature.

Over and above this difficulty, three religions have competed with the same claim. To start with, Judaism, then Christianity and thereafter Islam have the same contention and beliefs. To worship without being allowed to pursue spirituality or seeking an opportunity to see or feel the divine is a very limiting and constraining experience. This can seem harsh to the thinking person.

Experts in Europe say that currently, only about 25 per cent of people in West Europe declare themselves as Christians, and only a small minority of even these people are church-goers. In other words, Christianity is in no position to help to keep Muslims out of the Continent.

Between the two world wars, waging class conflict was seen as something normal until it was countered with class collaboration. In its heyday, Christianity could have helped combat Islam. Today, the Europeans are abandoning their liberation and using nationalism to prevent further immigration from Asia and Africa. In a way, this is an about-turn, because, after WWII, nationalism had become unwelcome. Books were written to show that fascism was nothing but an intensification of nationalism and therefore, was unwelcome any longer. The coming together of Europe under the banner of the European Union (EU) was a demonstration of the post-WWII European opposition to nationalism.

The European far Right has been often accused by its Leftist and liberal critics of representing the worst things in European ideological traditions. These are; namely, exclusive “nationalist essentialism”, dogmatism that runs counter to the values that were bequeathed by the Enlightenment and political authoritarianism, which the Right is accused of re-energizing. But the European Right today conveys a simple but powerful message today, based on three core ideas: rediscovery of the nation and national identities; warning of the dangers of unrestrained immigration, particularly from Islamic countries, which is derided as xenophobia; and anti-politician, anti-establishment populism. In this regard, the far Right offers its followers an exclusive identity. The European Right has identified conventional politicians, i.e., the establishment as the culprits and advocates simple and now increasingly unavoidable solutions like throwing out unwanted foreigners and overthrowing the traditional political class.

Right or wrong, good or bad, this seems to be catching on in today’s Europe. The Soviet Union was a superpower inhabiting a part of Europe’s geography, to which also the European Union was an answer. An ideologically non-descript Russia, with its fifteen republics having seceded is no longer seen as an almighty threat. As a result, quite a few European experts may begin to consult crystal gazers to check up on the future of the European Union."

1145063651,20231208,"A top European Union official told Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday that China and the EU must address both the imbalances in their trading relationship and Russian aggression against Ukraine.

The two are divided on both issues. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meeting Xi in the Chinese capital, said they need to manage their differences responsibly.

“China is the EU’s most important trading partner,” von der Leyen said in opening remarks posted on the commission’s website. “But there are clear imbalances and differences that we must address.”

Xi said that China and the EU should handle their differences through dialogue, and pushed back against what his government sees as a shift in European policy on China toward a more strident and competitive approach. The two sides “should not regard each other as rivals because of different systems, reduce cooperation because of competition, and confront each other because of differences”, he said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

The meeting comes a day after EU member Italy announced it was withdrawing from Xi’s signature “Belt and Road” initiative that aims to build a global network of Chinese-financed roads, ports and power plants. Italy became the first G7 country to sign on to the initiative in 2019, when the government at the time promoted it as a way of increasing trade with China while getting investments in major infrastructure projects.

Neither outcome materialized. In the intervening years, Italy’s trade deficit with China has ballooned from 20 billion euros to 48 billion euros (USD 21.5 billion to USD 51.8 billion.) Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin defended the initiative and appeared to imply that Italy had been influenced by forces hostile to China.

“China firmly opposes smearing and undermining cooperation in building the Belt and Road and opposes stoking bloc confrontation and divisions” Wang said at a daily briefing on Thursday.

After nearly three years of self-imposed isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic that took a heavy toll on its economy, and having adopted an assertive foreign policy that seeks to challenge the US-led world order, China now appears to be taking a slightly more moderate tone.

Xi held four hours of talks with US President Joe Biden last month in California in their first face-to-face meeting in a year, with the leaders vowing to stabilise their fraught relationship. Von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the president of the EU Council, met Xi in the morning and were meeting with China’s No. 2 leader, Premier Li Qiang, later in the day. Von der Leyen, as commission president, heads the day-to-day business of the EU, while Michel chairs the summits of EU leaders.

The talks were “candid, frank, in-depth and constructive”, Wang Lutong, director general of the Foreign Ministry’s European Department, told reporters following the meetings. He repeated China’s call for an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine and the opening of talks between Western leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Dialogue on human rights, economic cooperation, people-to-people exchanges, open trade, the environment, food security and China’s claim to Taiwan were also discussed, Wang said. The European Union is calling on China to improve market access for products from its 27 member countries to address an annual trade imbalance of more than USD 200 billion. China exported USD 458.5 billion worth of goods to the EU in the first 11 months of this year and imported USD 257.8 billion, according to Chinese customs data released on Thursday.

The EU has angered China by launching an investigation into the latter’s subsidies for electric vehicles to determine whether they give manufacturers in China an unfair competitive advantage in European markets.

“China has never deliberately pursued a trade surplus,” spokesperson Wang said ahead of the summit. He noted recent import and supply chain expos that he said encourage foreign companies to sell to the Chinese market of 1.4 billion people. Wang also took aim at possible EU restrictions on technology exports to China. “I’m afraid it’s unreasonable if the EU imposes strict restrictions on the export of high-tech products to China while expecting a significant increase in exports to China,” he

The EU is looking for better market access for a range of products including cosmetics, infant formula, wine and other alcoholic beverages. China has angered the EU by taking a neutral stance in what most European countries see as a Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. The EU is calling on China to use its influence with Russia to end the invasion, ensure that exports from or via China are not aiding Russia’s war effort and support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s peace formula.

Von der Leyen said the EU and China have global responsibilities as major powers and a shared interest in peace and security. “That is why it is essential to put an end to the Russian aggression against Ukraine and establish a just and lasting peace consistent with the UN Charter,” she said.

Xi said China and the EU should promote political settlements of international hot-spot issues, according to CCTV, which did not include any specific mention of the wars in Ukraine or Gaza."

1145067772,20231208,"Russian-Ukrainian conflict gives a dramatic boost to the development of the defence market of the European Union member states. Driven by an arms deficit, which was caused by U.S.-EU military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022, Europe’s arms market drastically needs replenishment of its depleted ammunition and weapon stocks. Moreover, this regional market is estimated to be the most lucrative in the foreseeable future. At the same time, it seems to be overcrowded in years to come.

The United States of America and the European Union bear the main burden of military-technical assistance to Kyiv: as of July 31, 2023, Ukraine has received no less than USD 46.8 billion from Washington, and an amount of some USD 65 billion was sent by European countries.

It is noteworthy that not only do the Western powers allocate some chunks of money to assist Ukraine, but they also send defence materiel in large quantities. Kyiv is known to have taken the deliveries of the following weapon systems:
• no less than 250 launchers of various ground-based air defence weapons.
• … and artillery ammunition, small arms and light weapons, fire support systems, etc.

Modern weapons (those produced after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War) account for no less than 45-50% of the aforementioned numbers (in terms of quantity; when it comes to financial volume, they account for 75-80%). Those weapons need to be replaced urgently.

However, the European defence manufacturers are at their lowest manufacturing rates since 1991. According to various estimates, they will have been capable of replenishing the draining stocks of the European NATO members by 2032-2033. This forecast is the most positive; according to the worst predictions, the weapon systems sent to Ukraine (as well as ammunition stocks) would be replaced and replenished by 2040. Thus, the European arms market, which is considered to be rather lucrative (up to 30-35% of the global arms market at its best), drastically needs new weapons – and needs it yesterday.

This case might spark fierce and even ruthless competition between European and US arms manufacturers. It is no secret that it is Europe that donates most of its weapons (even those of US origins) to Ukraine. The US assistance (even though it is vital) is limited to IFVs, APCs, some 155mm artillery, ammunition and support systems. Moreover, Washington delivers surpluses, while European countries dispatch linear vehicles right from combat units. The pieces of materiel in service must be replaced.

It is not the first attempt of US defence firms to land in Europe. In 2019, the US tried to ban several European programs aimed at the developing of sophisticated weapon systems. According to a notification issued by the U.S. Department of State and reportedly signed by Ellen Lord, Under Secretary of Defence for Acquisition and Sustainment, the implementation of Europe-driven projects aimed at the development of brand-new weapons would result in some economic and political ramifications.

The adoption of the statute of the European Defence Fund by the members of the European Union also irked Washington: according to the document, the EU countries were granted with the right to involve some non-European countries in defence research and development (R&D) processes, with intellectual property belonging to the EU members. The Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) program, which embraces 25 EU state members is also declared to be non-compliant with US goals by Washington.

The EU’s plans in the defence area pose a threat to the integration of the Transatlantic defence industry and military cooperation within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty organization, some Washington officials noted.

According to the aforementioned US letter, the development of the EU-driven defence R&D programs will duplicate non-interchangeable defence systems, which is set to dramatically increase the EU’s military expenditures and ramp up unnecessary competition between Europe and the United States. Washington also required European defence manufacturers to limit involvement of non-EU countries in the development of cutting-edge weapon systems.

As of October 2023, the presence of US commercially available defence hardware is mostly limited to Poland (M1 Abrams MBTs, M142 HIMARS rocket launchers, F-35 Lighting II joint strike fighter); some other European nations (Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Switzerland). However, the competition between US and European defence firms will definitely step up.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni looks on as she waits to meet European Parliament President Roberta Metsola at Palazzo Chigi, in Rome, Italy, Dec. 6, 2023.

China has defended its Belt and Road Initiative after Italy formally informed Beijing of its decision to leave the infrastructure project.

Responding to a question about the withdrawal, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press briefing on Thursday in Beijing that “China firmly opposes attempts to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation or stoke bloc confrontation and division” without naming any country.

It is unclear whether the statement was directed at Italy or a third party that, in Beijing’s opinion, may have interfered to dissuade Rome from participation.

Also on Thursday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, addressing broader relations between China and the European Union during a summit with top EU officials in Beijing, said that the two sides should be partners and “eliminate all kinds of interference.”

The first in-person EU-China summit in four years aimed to promote “constructive and stable EU-China relations,” according to an official statement.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in her first public comments on leaving the BRI said “The tool of the [BRI] ... has not produced the results that were expected.”

Italy exported 16.4 billion euros (US$17.7 billion) worth of goods to China last year but imported 57.5 billion euros ($62 billion) of China-made products, making a large deficit, according to official data.

Meloni was speaking to reporters in Rome on Thursday after media reports that her government had formally notified Beijing of the decision earlier this week.

“I think that we should ... improve our cooperation with China on trade [and] the economy,” Reuters quoted the prime minister as saying.

Italy joined China’s mega scheme in 2019, the only member of the Group of Seven major developed economies, or G7, to do so. At the time, the United States warned Rome that “the Chinese Communist Party is trying to leverage its economic presence in Italy to serve its own strategic purposes.”

Italy’s BRI membership expires in March, 2024, and Meloni had indicated that she wanted to leave.

“This decision was largely expected for months and was only a matter of time,” said Filippo Fasulo, a political scientist from the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) in Milan.

“In the last months, negotiations have been underway to understand the best way to terminate the agreement without causing diplomatic clashes,” Fasulo, co-head of the think tank’s Geo-economics Center, told Radio Free Asia.

A Chinese geopolitical commentator agreed that the move, while significant, “was not entirely unexpected due to Italy’s growing skepticism about the tangible benefits from the deal.”

“Italy’s decision to leave the BRI aligns with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's critical view of the partnership and broader Western concerns about Beijing's influence,” said Andy Mok, a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI – Xi Jinping’s signature mega project.

China said it has benefited more than 150 countries in the world with infrastructure contracts worth over US$2 trillion to develop projects such as seaports, railways and bridges. Critics meanwhile accuse Beijing of setting up debt traps and expanding geopolitical and economic influence.

“China may react to Italy's exit with skepticism, but a complete breakdown in bilateral relations seems unlikely,” said Mok.

“Italy's strategic approach in exiting the BRI, aimed at maintaining political dialogue, suggests a cautious balance to avoid severe economic retaliation from China,” the political commentator added.

“High-level diplomatic engagements and efforts to balance Italy's geopolitical stance indicate a continued interest in a robust, albeit recalibrated, relationship with China.”

Filippo Fasulo from Italy’s ISPI said that he would not expect Beijing to respond with serious punitive economic measures.

“Italy and China had consultations before this decision and it is not in the interest of China while attempting to improve its relations with the EU to retaliate against one of its principal members,” he said.

He also noted that there are “signals,” like the decision by Chinese authorities to waive visitor visas for Italian citizens as of Dec. 1, that indicate the main differences between the two governments might have already been settled.

In the Italian expert’s opinion, “Italy’s participation, even if ineffective, was highly politicized and symbolic.”

However, the country needs to maintain the relationship with the world’s second largest economy.

“Now, it is possible to restart this relationship, as other countries are doing, bearing in mind the context of the great power competition and Italy's network of alliances,” Fasulo said.

The EU said in a statement after the Dec. 7 summit with Xi Jinping that China is the bloc’s major trading partner but “the relationship is critically and structurally imbalanced.”

“The EU stressed to China the importance of achieving a more balanced economic relationship with a level playing field and reciprocity,” it said. “The EU does not intend to decouple or to turn inwards.”

Andy Mok in Beijing said “Europe’s initial declaration to decouple from China was a fantasy.”

“‘De-risking’ is a flawed political compromise. But strategic interdependence is a historic inevitability,” he noted."

The program was rolled out in 6 counties in the coast namely Tana River, Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale, Taita Taveta and Mombasa County. With the training sessions being facilitated through workshops and experiential learning. The entrepreneurs were equipped with financial, operational, and digital marketing skills enabling them to access new markets. Some of the MSMEs also received financing which enabled them to improve their business capacity.

As part of the program, which is commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and co-funded by the European Union (EU). Stanbic donated 28 computers to 3 Vocational Training Centres, namely Mamba, Mwanjila and Kisauni, to support the adoption and utilization of technology in business operations. To ensure learning continuity, 59 instructors from various vocational training centers in the six coastal counties took part in a Training of Trainers learning under the program.

Pauline Mbayah, Head, Stanbic Kenya Foundation said, ‘’The coastal region boasts of vast resources and knowledge which, if effectively utilized, can translate into increased income and job opportunities among SMEs. By financing and training SMEs in the blue economy space, Stanbic Kenya Foundation is boosting the local economy by positioning local entrepreneurs for continuous growth. As these enterprises grow, they are able to employ more people and build their market share, which subsequently leads to socioeconomic growth, locally and nationally. The Blue Economy holds immense potential for sustainable development across various sectors including maritime, aquaculture, logistics and culture, and we are committed to building the coastal region’s business resilience and competitiveness.’’

246 entrepreneurs graduated from the Enterprise Development and Entrepreneurship Promotion Program at the coast. To date a total of Kshs 7M has been disbursed to the SMEs.

In last three years, Stanbic Bank has worked with SMEs across Kenya and supported them through capacity development and financing solutions. During this time, The Stanbic Kenya Foundation in partnership with GIZ has disbursed over KES 29M for economic empowerment to MSEs in Uasin Gishu, Kisumu, Mombasa and Nairobi counties.

Dr Henrik Schmidtke Go Blue Project Component leader, commented, on the projecting saying, “The Go Blue Project has been a great opportunity to integrate youth, women and enterprises in the blue economy value chains, specifically the partnership with Stanbic Kenya Foundation has placed them onto the digital pathway opening them up to new opportunities.”

Under the social and economic pillar, Stanbic has driven financial inclusion by disbursing over KES 128M in grants and catalytic funding to over 400 MSMEs and trained 952 MSMEs through the GIZ/SKF MSE resilience programme.

Stanbic Kenya, Stanbic Kenya Foundation the German government and the EU, have partnered to sustainably enhance the development of the blue economy sector in Kenya through training and funding. Stanbic’s blue economy agenda is aimed towards facilitating the reduction in adverse impacts on marine habitats.

In 2022, KES 25M was allocated through partnership with the GIZ for access to finance by MSMEs through the Go- Blue project which is aimed at improving competitiveness and enhancing business capacities of Blue Economy."

Earlier flights are less likely to get delayed.

1145099411,20231208,"The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has stated that countries of the European Union will produce one million artillery shells per year from 2024, as the continent’s defence industries orientate towards more active production line in the face of Russia aggression in Ukraine.

Speaking to members of the European Defence Agency (EDA) at the end of November, von der Leyen claimed countries of the European Union – referred to in the speech as “Europe” – had produced or delivered 480,000 rounds of artillery ammunition to Ukraine.

“This would have been unimaginable just two years ago. And it already marks a massive step forward for our defence cooperation,” von der Leyen stated.

However, this claimed provision falls short of the pledge to send one million 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine by March 2024.

According to a 6 December report by , EU states have placed orders for only 60,000 artillery shells under a scheme to provide Ukraine with one million rounds of ammunition by Spring 2024.

By contrast, the US alone has provided two million rounds of 155mm ammunition, 800,000 105mm shells, 10,000 203mm shells, 200,000 152mm rounds, 40,000 130mm shells, and 40,000 130mm shells, along with 100,000 guided and unguided rockets and more than 400,000 mortar rounds from 60-120mm calibre, according to Department of Defense figures.

This amounts to more than 3.5 million rounds of artillery and mortar ammunition since February 2022. For small arms rifles and machines guns, the US have provided 400 million rounds to Ukraine.

Ukraine’s usage of artillery ammunition has not been officially disclosed but is understood to run into several thousand rounds per day.

Western countries such as the UK, US, France, Germany, Sweden, and others have also donated 155mm-capable artillery systems such as the AS90 and M109 Paladin howitzers, while Ukraine also retains a large stock of Soviet-era artillery, despite war attrition.

The spooling up of European Union member states’ defence industry will be critical to the fate of Ukraine, which is dependent on outside assistance to combat Russian forces.

A likely concerning factor for Ukraine will be the ongoing political struggles in the United States, its largest military supporter, which was recently revealed to be running short of Presidential Drawdown Authority funding being used to sustain military assistance to Kyiv.

In addition, the US Congress moved to block a supplementary budget package that included a $44bn commitment to Ukraine due to political infighting, raising the prospect of a US Government shutdown in early 2024. The looming US election, with potential Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump not keen to sustain US support of Ukraine, could have decisive impact on the outcome of the Ukraine-Russia war.

It far from certain that EU states would be unable to bridge the gap should the US reduce or withdraw its willingness or ability to support Ukraine, despite the bold words from EU politicians such as von der Leyen.

Wilson Jones, defence analyst at GlobalData, said the US is providing “the majority” of ammunition to Ukraine, with EU states suffering from “fairly serious” supply chain issues. It would be “highly unlikely” that the EU could step in to fill the ammunition void, Jones said.

“On several occasions, their response to artillery ammunition shortfalls has been to buy shells from American firms, rather than increase domestic production. EU plans to increase production haven’t reached anything close to their targets,” Jones told .

During the EDA speech, von der Leyen outlined the provision of EU support to Ukraine so far, amounting to €5.6bn ($6.4bn), and the delivery of armoured vehicles, helicopters, air defnece systems, and artillery ammunition. One element of this process has been the development of the European defence industry reinforcement through common procurement act (EDIRPA), which was signed and published on 26 October this year.

“Now, for the first time ever, we are mobilising Europe’s defence industry to sustain a war effort. The European Defence Fund has been complemented by EDIRPA. And it has led to ASAP, the Act in Support of Ammunition Production,” von der Leyen said.

However, von der Leyen stated in her speech to the EDA that all these efforts were “not enough”, and that greater defence industrial support would have to be provided to Ukraine.

“The war in Ukraine is consuming more hardware than any other war in recent history. Russia has fired ten million shells in a year, [while] Ukraine consumes 10,000 drones per month. The reality is that we did not have sufficient weapons and ammunition available. No large stocks, and a lack of spare capacity,” von der said.

Continuing, von der Leyen stated that while EU member states’ national defence budget are rising, “too much” was being spent in isolated single-country programmes, rather than combining requirements into one common design, as envisaged through the PESCO structure. According to von der Leyen, collaborative defence spending between EU states was below 20%, some distance from the 35% target.

In addition, too much of European countries’ defence spending was being done so outside of the continent. “Latest figures show that additional funds are in large majority spent outside the European Union. We are predominantly buying alone and buying abroad,” von der Leyen said.

“The next chapter is a fully fledged European Defence Union. So that Europe can finally take strategic responsibility for its own future.”"

Margrethe Vestager, who took unpaid leave in September to pursue the bank job, plans to return to her role at the EU’s executive commission for a few months, the government in Copenhagen said.

The new president of the EIB, the 27-nation bloc’s development bank, is set to begin a six-year term on January 1.

“Out of respect for the further process, the government, together with Margrethe Vestager, has decided to withdraw the Danish candidature,” Denmark’s government said.

EU finance ministers have agreed to back Spain’s economy minister, Nadia Calvino, becoming the bank’s next president.

Ms Calvino, 55, said that under her leadership, the bank “will have an even more important role going forward to fund the green transition, to provide financial support to the rebuilding of Ukraine, and also support the role of Europe in the world”.

She will succeed Werner Hoyer, a German whose second mandate as EIB chief ends on December 31.

Her candidacy still requires approval from the bank’s board of directors and board of governors.

“Although we would have liked to see a different outcome, we are satisfied that there is now a clarification of the process,” Danish Business Minister Morten Bodskov said.

Ms Vestager is arguably one of the world’s most important tech regulators.

She slapped Google with multi-billion-dollar anti-trust penalties, ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook over its WhatsApp acquisition.

Such flagship enforcement cases struck fear in Silicon Valley and drew attention in Washington.

Ms Vestager also took on Starbucks and McDonald’s and looked into Nike’s tax arrangements.

Other targets have included Italian automaker Fiat and Russian gas giant Gazprom.

She confirmed her return to the European Commission, which polices EU laws and negotiates trade on behalf of member countries, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Ms Vestager, who is a vice president of the executive commission as well as commissioner for competition, said she had wanted to reform the European Investment Bank bank by “making it more strategic, faster and more relevant”.

The mandate of the present European Commission expires next year.

Elections across the 27 member nations are scheduled for June 6-9."

1145140408,20231208,"The European Union recommended on November 8 that Georgia be granted its long-awaited candidate status, an essential step to future membership of the bloc. The recommendation is, however, contingent on Tbilisi meeting nine conditions: a reminder that Georgia still has a long way to go before accession talks can begin. For now, the main sticking point is that carrying out the reforms the EU wants may damage the country’s ruling party, Georgian Dream. Candidate status is not a panacea, nor is it an iron-clad guarantee that a country will become an EU member state. Still, the announcement will likely calm political tensions in Georgia, and soothe relations between Tbilisi and Brussels that have been marred by disagreements on how the country is progressing toward meeting EU recommendations. Georgian political life has become increasingly polarized in the last year. The opposition lacks financial resources, a viable political agenda, and charismatic leaders. The ruling party is more popular, but it too is facing significant challenges, including growing political apathy. Candidate status will not solve these problems, which will persist in the run-up to the 2024 parliamentary elections. While Georgian Dream is likely to do well in the vote, it will be a challenge to balance Brussels’ expectations and Georgians’ desire for democratic and economic progress against the party’s own political ambitions. Georgian Dream will, however, benefit from the fact that real progress on Georgia’s path to the EU was achieved on its watch. One pressing issue will be addressing problems in Georgia’s judiciary, which has been notoriously susceptible to political influence since the country regained independence in the early 1990s. Cleaning up the legal system is one of the EU’s conditions for Georgia, and it will be extremely difficult for the ruling party to deliver. Government critics argue that an impartial judiciary would undermine Georgian Dream’s ability to dominate political life.

Equally important is the requirement for Georgia to align its foreign and security policies with the EU. It’s true that Tbilisi has long pursued a pro-Western foreign policy, and awarding candidate status goes some way to refuting allegations often heard in the West that the Georgian government is pro-Russian. At the same time, Tbilisi has explored a multi-vector foreign policy over the last year, building closer economic ties with the EU’s systemic rivals. Expecting Tbilisi to abandon its close links with China, for example, would be futile. A major test will be to see whether the tender to construct a deep seaport at Anaklia—a critical infrastructure project for Georgia as it seeks to become a Eurasian transit hub—is awarded to a Western or Chinese company. But it is relations with Russia that will likely pose the greatest challenge to Georgia’s EU aspirations. Tbilisi has trodden a difficult path since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, navigating between its support for Kyiv and a revanchist, aggressive Moscow. This has not always been successful, and there has been some tension with Western partners. After all, Georgia’s economic ties with Russia have strengthened, despite the war in Ukraine, the longstanding Russian occupation of 20 percent of Georgian territory, Moscow’s apparent decision to open a naval base in some of that territory—Abkhazia—and the recent abduction and killing of Georgian nationals (on November 6, for example, a Georgian national was murdered by Russian troops while trying to visit a church in occupied South Ossetia). So far, it is not clear how the Georgian government will be able to balance EU integration against relations with Russia. Moscow might downplay the significance of EU enlargement near its borders by outwardly focusing its ire on NATO expansion, but that is only half the story. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 because Kyiv was re-orientating toward the EU. In other words, EU expansion is of no less concern for Moscow than NATO enlargement. Notably, Georgia appeared alongside Ukraine in the infamous ultimatum that Moscow handed to the West in the months before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Among other demands, the Kremlin wanted Georgia to reverse its pro-Western trajectory.

On paper, Russia could seek a military solution in Georgia. But Russia is already bogged down in Ukraine and suffering from Western sanctions. Opening a second front in the South Caucasus would only lead to further isolation, and perhaps reduce the chances of success in Ukraine. A more realistic strategy would be for Moscow to pressure Tbilisi via sanctions that could hurt the Georgian economy. But even that would not be enough to force Tbilisi into a foreign policy U-turn. While Russia’s share of Georgia’s trade rose to 12.4 percent in the first six months of 2023—the highest figure for sixteen years—it remains relatively modest. In comparison, the EU is Georgia’s main economic partner, accounting for 20.5 percent of overall trade. Whatever path Russia chooses, the announcement of EU candidate status for Georgia has broader implications for Europe and Russia in the South Caucasus. Going forward, the EU looks set to increase its engagement with the South Caucasus, an area of increasing geopolitical importance when it comes to energy diversification (as evidenced by the expanded gas deal signed with Azerbaijan in 2022); trans-Eurasian trade routes such as the expanding “Middle Corridor;” and broader Black Sea security. Georgia could even end up serving as an example for neighboring countries, especially Armenia, which is increasingly frustrated by Russia’s unwillingness to honor its security commitments. EU expansion in the South Caucasus fits into a broader trend of what could be termed Russia’s managed decline in the region. Signs of Moscow’s dwindling prestige were on show well before 2022, but the war in Ukraine has accelerated this process. Events leading up to Azerbaijan’s seizure of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region this year were a particularly vivid illustration of the shift in Russia’s position. In the congested geopolitical space of the South Caucasus, Moscow is increasingly only one of several major powers vying for influence.

1145152706,20231208,"TikTok has recently seen a surge in a new challenge that could have serious legal consequences, particularly in the state of Louisiana. While challenges are often harmless and entertaining, the ""112 Challenge"" involving iPhone users and Siri is causing more harm than amusement.

What is the 112 Challenge?

The premise of the ""112 Challenge"" revolves around iPhone users instructing Siri by saying, ""Siri, one twelve."" This command triggers a three-second countdown before the phone automatically dials 911, the emergency services number. This feature is designed to swiftly aid individuals in distress during emergencies, but unfortunately, it has been misused in the latest TikTok trend.

The Problem with this TikTok trend

In Louisiana, this challenge has resulted in several teenagers facing legal repercussions, including arrests. The misuse of this iPhone feature falls under the scope of Louisiana law, particularly §285 of the state's legal code pertaining to telephone communications and improper use. This statute clearly outlines what constitutes unlawful behavior regarding phone usage, encompassing various actions, including using obscene or indecent language, harassing or intimidating others through phone calls, and making repeated communications with the intent to annoy or offend.

Participants engaging in the ""112 Challenge"" are potentially violating these laws by misusing emergency services, creating a false alarm, and potentially causing disruptions to emergency responders. Not only does this challenge pose a risk of fines and imprisonment, but it can also tie up vital emergency lines, diverting resources from genuine crises and potentially putting lives in danger.

This law states that violating these provisions can result in penalties, including fines up to five hundred dollars and imprisonment for up to six months for the first offense. Subsequent offenses could lead to more severe consequences, with fines reaching up to five thousand dollars and imprisonment for up to two years.

It's imperative to educate teenagers and TikTok users about the serious legal implications and risks associated with partaking in such challenges. Emphasizing the importance of responsible use of technology, especially concerning emergency services, is crucial in preventing unnecessary legal troubles and ensuring the safety of the community."

Bus Rapid Transit and auto-centric land uses: Plans for a drive-thru on Colfax Avenue in Denver where a future Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line will run are causing local urbanists to think deeper about zoning changes that were supposed to support more walkable building forms in certain districts. Existing zoning creates restrictions that prioritize pedestrians but still allow auto-based uses and a zoning overlay might not fix the problem. (Andy Cushen | Denver Urbanism)

$7.5 billion of federal funds for EV chargers but not one built yet: As sales of electric vehicles increase, the demand for vehicle chargers grows as well. In anticipation of this need, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA, also known as the Infrastructure Bill) set aside $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure, much of it to be distributed through states. But 27 states and DC have yet to start soliciting bids from installation companies and those that have are yet to distribute any funds. States that prepared for charging networks even before the bill such as Ohio however, are way ahead of everyone else. (James Bikales | Politico)

Ylva Johansson, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, said this after a meeting with EU interior ministers.

“15 EU member states have pledged to give protection to almost 40,000 Afghans.

“This goes hand in hand with better measures to deal with irregular migration and how we move forward on ”Migration EU.”

Johansson said Germany alone was ready to accept 25,000 refugees from Afghanistan.

According to the EU Commission, the 15 member countries have already evacuated around 28,000 people from Afghanistan in the past few months.

The 40,000 now mentioned are additional evacuees and the figure is actually 38,146.

A total of 60,000 Afghans accepted admission places in EU countries for 2021 and 2022.

However, this number does not only apply to Afghanistan.

Around two thirds of the 60,000 are earmarked for Afghans needing protection.

After the Taliban came to power at the end of August, the EU states decided not to make any concrete commitments to accept people from Afghanistan for the time being.

1145177716,20231208,"Last year, the EU Parliament was rocked by accusations foreign actors had attempted through bribes to corrupt its democratic processes in a scandal dubbed ""Qatargate."" What do we know so far? Surprisingly little.

December 9, 2022, started like any other cold, unremarkable Friday in Brussels. The following week, European Union lawmakers would head to the French city of Strasbourg for one of their regular plenary sessions, and preparations were underway.

But by the early evening, a political bombshell had dropped. Word had hit the press about a series of spectacular raids taking place across the Belgian capital and in Italy, uncovering bundles of apparently ill-gotten cash in the homes and offices of people either working in or closely linked to the European Parliament.

That day alone, eight arrests were made, and raids were carried out over 19 addresses in Belgium and Italy, according to the Belgian newspaper Le Soir. In the weeks to come, more would follow. A total of €1.5 million ($1.6 million) was eventually seized.

Daniel Freund, a German Green lawmaker and prominent EU anti-corruption voice, describes the first days after the exposure of the suspected cash-for-influence scheme that was quickly dubbed Qatargate as a blur, with information coming out in dribs and drabs.

By midday the following Monday, as the Parliament was set to reconvene in Strasbourg, Freund's office had been contacted by no fewer than 64 different journalists, he recalled. ""I don't think the parliament has ever gotten so much attention and for such a sad story, ruining the reputation of the house.""

One year on, surprisingly little about the case has been definitively established. Two suspects have apparently made confessions, but since then, Belgium's investigations have stalled.

Few would argue that the full extent of the network of lobbyists and politicians has been mapped out. So far, no one has been convicted, and many suspects maintain their innocence. Here's a guide to the twists and turns of a real-life political thriller that is far from over.

Who are the main players in Qatargate?

Of the eight arrests, the highest profile face at the heart of the scandal is Greek MEP and former European Parliament Vice President Eva Kaili, a sleek, poised ex-TV presenter.

Kaili's life partner, Francesco Giorgi, and his boss, former MEP Antonio Panzeri, were also detained on December 9, 2022. Giorgi worked as a parliamentary assistant but also separately for Panzeri. Both are Italian and, like all of the MEPs suspected in the sprawling corruption case, belong to the center-left socialist parliamentary group.

Panzeri confessed to involvement in January 2023 to get clemency and is believed to have been at the center of a complex network. Giorgi confessed even sooner but denied that his partner, Kaili, was involved in the scheme, according to leaked interview transcripts.

Two other MEPs were eventually arrested after having their parliamentary immunity lifted at the request of investigators: Marc Tarabella of Belgium and Andrea Cozzolino of Italy.

Also detained was Niccolo Figa-Talamanca, the head of an NGO that shared offices with an organization Panzeri runs. Panzeri has said that Figa-Talamanca was not involved, according to leaked interview transcripts seen by DW, though these only represent Panzeri's view. Figa-Talamanca has since been released unconditionally.

Another detainee was Luca Visentini, the former secretary-general of the International Trade Unions Confederation. He has told the media that he only accepted two donations of tens of thousands of euros to fund his campaign to lead ITUC.

All of them, save Panzeri and Giorgi, insist on their innocence. The web of potential names also extends far broader, including family members of certain key suspects and other figures in the European Parliament.

What are the Qatargate suspects accused of?

In essence, the charges — which, according to media reports, boil down to membership in a criminal organization, corruption and money-laundering — relate to peddling political influence.

The allegations against Qatar were the first to emerge publicly, hence the nickname ""Qatargate."" However, leaked transcripts of suspect interviews seen by DW suggest it may have started with Morocco and have also involved Mauritania. All three governments deny involvement or have declined to comment.

According to an investigation published this week by Politico, an American news outlet, leaked case files provide evidence of 300 alleged attempts to manipulate EU democracy. These included efforts to stifle critical resolutions (or statements summing up the Parliament's official position) about certain countries outside Europe.

What precisely the money allegedly paid by these countries was supposed to achieve remains unclear — whether it was supposed to secure certain policy goals or improve the image of some non-EU in Brussels.

Nick Aiossa, acting director of international anti-corruption NGO Transparency International's EU chapter, says that even though the Parliament's formal role in foreign policy was limited, he still believes it could be worth it for foreign states to drop a few million euros.

""Certain (non-EU) countries have put a great deal of value in the soft power of the non-binding resolutions that the parliament puts out in relation to external relations,"" Aiossa explained.

As well as having extensive press coverage and a closely watched public speaking platform, EU parliamentarians also meet regularly with senior officials from other EU institutions.

Where are they now?

No one tied to Qatargate is currently behind bars. Panzeri, Giorgi, Kaili, Figa-Talamanca, Tarabella and Cozzolino were all released, most of them instructed to wear an electronic tag.

Kaili, who vehemently maintains her innocence, has even been allowed to return to Parliament — Freund, the German Green MEP, said he had seen her around. Although everyone was entitled to the presumption of innocence, Freund acknowledged seeing her in person was ""bizarre.""

The Greek MEP has, in fact, gone on the offensive, accusing the Belgian judiciary of overstepping in its investigations against her and even trying to rebrand the scandal as ""Belgiumgate.""

In recent months, lawyers for the suspects made compelling enough arguments to secure an internal inquiry into Belgium's investigations, delaying the Qatargate probe by some months.

Where does the case stand now?

DW correspondent Jack Parrock has followed the ins and outs closely over the past year. For him, the hope of finding the truth about the Qatargate corruption ring is dwindling.

""So many statements have been changed, so many leaks have come out of the investigation, and many of the suspects are now trying to clear their names or change the narrative around them,"" he explained.

""The story has become so large and nebulous that it can be hard to know what's true information and what's lobbying for a cause,"" Parrock continued.

For example, Parrock said there were still unanswered questions about the Belgian MEP Marie Arena, who has never been questioned or arrested and still has parliamentary immunity. ""Journalists, including myself, have seen the police investigation's file from before the initial arrests, in which she is heavily implicated.""

Parrock added that defense lawyers even believe they might be able to have the cases thrown out before they ever go to trial on the grounds of police and judicial malpractice.

""If that happens and no one is ever convicted, then the story sees yet another major shift in direction,"" he said. ""It will become far more about the competence, or incompetence, of the Belgians to prosecute crimes of corruption in their country, which hosts the EU institutions, and less about salacious personal stories of the suspects.""

There is also the question of the Parliament's institutional response. In the wake of Qatargate, the EU legislature brought about a modest package of reforms, like requiring all MEPs to disclose meetings with lobbyists rather than just certain kinds of MEPs. However, some believe the eventual response was not good enough.

Aiossa said much broader cultural issues within the Parliament were left untouched, including an unaudited generous monthly allowance for MEPs on top of their salaries and permission to hold side jobs that could pose a conflict of interest as long as they are declared.

""MEPs have developed, unfortunately, a rather toxic culture of impunity,"" Aiossa said.

Freund told DW he was disappointed with reform efforts in the end. Initial momentum to change straight after the scandal broke had clearly faded away.

There had been a ""moment where parliament was willing to ensure that this doesn't happen ever again,"" he said. ""From there on, it was it was pretty much downhill."""

These days, flight delays are trending higher and higher, according to statistics from the Department of Transportation. In 2018 and 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the average share of departure delays for flights in the U.S. was 19% and 19.5%, respectively. In 2022 and 2023 (as of August), departure delays were up to 21.5% and 22%, the highest average in nearly a decade.

Unlike the more generous regulations in the European Union, U.S. carriers are not obligated to compensate passengers for flight delays. However, each company has its own policy, so travelers may be able to get something in exchange for the headache of a delay. It's always advisable to check with the airline to see if they will make accommodations, such as rebooking on a different flight or providing meal vouchers.

Since the federal government doesn't require airlines to provide passengers with delay protections, it's up to the flying public to ensure a delayed flight doesn't ruin plans. When traveling for an immovable event like a wedding or cruise, for example, consider leaving a day in advance to add a buffer for any potential delays. Some travel insurance policies also compensate for long delays and could provide reimbursements for food, hotels, and more.

It's wise to be particularly cautious when flying from certain U.S. airports that report more flight delays across all U.S. airlines than others. TravelPerk explored 25 of the biggest airports in the country and ranked them according to the share of departure flights that experience delays, using data from the Department of Transportation from September 2022 to August 2023.

1145260402,20231209,"European Union negotiators have reached an agreement on the world’s first comprehensive artificial intelligence rules. This will provide legal oversight of technology used for popular generative AI services such as ChatGPT. The tentative political agreement for the Artificial Intelligence Act was signed Friday after overcoming significant differences on controversial points including generative AI and police use of facial recognition surveillance. European Commissioner Thierry Breton tweeted “Deal!” and emphasized that the EU is the first continent to set clear rules for the use of AI.

Negotiators held closed-door talks for hours to secure the political victory for the flagship legislation. The European Parliament and member countries must still vote on it next year, but it has already been deemed a formality by Brando Benifei, an Italian lawmaker co-leading the body’s negotiating efforts.

Generative AI companies like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have been rapidly developing and attracting both users and concerns about the technology’s social and ethical impacts. While proposals to regulate AI are being developed by countries like the US, UK, China, and global coalitions, the EU’s strong and comprehensive regulation is seen as a powerful example by many governments considering regulation.

Some experts believe that the EU’s rules will extend their obligations to markets outside the continent as it is not efficient to re-train separate models for different markets.

The AI Act was conceived to mitigate the dangers of specific AI functions based on their risk level, from low to unacceptable. Lawmakers have pushed to expand it to foundation models, advanced systems that underpin general purpose AI services like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard chatbot. After reaching a strength compromise on this, the most advanced foundation models that pose the biggest “systemic risks” will get extra scrutiny.

One of the most contentious issues was around AI-powered facial recognition surveillance systems, which was eventually resolved with a compromise. European lawmakers wanted a full ban on public use, while governments of member countries sought exemptions for law enforcement to use them in serious crime prevention. A compromise with strong checks was agreed upon.

1145272847,20231209,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan: Rights groups expressed their deep concerns about the severe human rights violations faced by religious minorities including forced religious conversions and child marriages of Christian and Hindu girls, and violent attacks on the pretext of false blasphemy accusations.

They urged legal duty bearers such as; the police, judiciary, and public representatives to help strengthen and implement legal and administrative safeguards to protect minorities against human rights abuses.

This call was emphasized by human rights defenders during a consultative meeting organized by the Voice for Justice (VFJ) to mark International Human Rights Day.

Joseph Jansen, Chairperson at Voice for Justice (VFJ) stressed the need for the government’s obligations and commitments to translate into effective and sustainable implementation with concrete targets related to human rights. He noted that Pakistan’s economy has been benefitting since 2014 due to its engagement with international human rights protection mechanisms. Despite this, the European Union has extended Pakistan’s GPS+ status for another four years, while expressing concerns about the country’s progress in human rights. EU assessment report of Pakistan under GPS+ pointed out some developments that question the progress achieved by Pakistan.

Ashiknaz Khokhar referred to the EU report identifying Pakistan’s shortcomings that persist in protecting religious freedom and minorities’ rights, in particular, misuse of blasphemy laws, coerced faith conversions and child marriages, and hate speech and violence against minorities, religious content in school textbooks, and the lack of implementation of job quota. He emphasized the need for political will coupled with more determined action to implement reforms and better protect human rights. He urged the government of Pakistan to making serious efforts and take substantial measures to implement recommendations from UN reviews and comply with its obligations under the GSP+.

Shamaun Alfred drew attention to the case of Anwar Kenneth, who has been behind the bar on blasphemy charges for over two decades, appealing for Kenneth’s acquittal. He voiced concern about influential groups that obstruct legislative attempts to criminalize forced conversions and revise blasphemy laws, indicating a critical absence of political will within the Pakistani government to address religious freedom violations that impact minorities.

Nadia Stephen said that religious minorities face discrimination and violence, therefore, the government should take measures to ensure equal rights, protect citizens’ life and property, and address outstanding issues through reforms such as; legislation criminalizing forced conversions, amending blasphemy laws to prevent its misuse, and legislation to prevent hate crimes and mob violence."

1145301924,20231209,"Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own.

This week, Google flooded the channels with announcements around Gemini, its new flagship multimodal AI model. Turns out it’s not as impressive as the company initially made it out to be — or, rather, the “lite” version of the model (Gemini Pro) Google released this week isn’t. (It doesn’t help matters that Google faked a product demo.) We’ll reserve judgement on Gemini Ultra, the full version of the model, until it begins making its way into various Google apps and services early next year.

But enough talk of chatbots. What’s a bigger deal, I’d argue, is a funding round that just barely squeezed into the workweek: Mistral AI raising €450 million (~$484 million) at $2 billion valuation.

We’ve covered Mistral before. In September, the company, co-founded by Google DeepMind and Meta alumni, released its first model, Mistral 7B, which it claimed at the time outperformed others of its size. Mistral closed one of Europe’s largest seed rounds to date prior to Friday’s fundraise — and it hasn’t even launched a product yet.

Now, my colleague Dominic has rightly pointed out that Paris-based Mistral’s fortunes are a red flag for many concerned about inclusivity. The startup’s co-founders are all white and male, and academically fit the homogenous, privileged profile of many of those in The New York Times’ roundly criticized list of AI changemakers.

At the same time, investors appear to be viewing Mistral — as well as its sometime rival, Germany’s Aleph Alpha — as Europe’s opportunity to plant its flag in the very fertile (at present) generative AI ground.

So far, the largest-profile and best-funded generative AI ventures have been stateside. OpenAI. Anthropic. Inflection AI. Cohere. The list goes on.

Mistral’s good fortune is in many ways a microcosm of the fight for AI sovereignty. The European Union (EU) desires to avoid being left behind in yet another technological leap while at the same time imposing regulations to guide the tech’s development. As Germany’s Vice Chancellor and Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck was recently quoted as saying: “The thought of having our own sovereignty in the AI sector is extremely important. [But] if Europe has the best regulation but no European companies, we haven’t won much.”

The entrepreneurship-regulation divide came into sharp relief this week as EU lawmakers attempted to reach an agreement on policies to limit the risk of AI systems. (Update: lawmakers clinched a deal on a risk-based framework for regulating AI late Friday night.) Lobbyists, led by Mistral, have in recent months pushed for a total regulatory carve-out for generative AI models. But EU lawmakers have resisted such an exemption — for now.

A lot’s riding on Mistral and its European competitors, all this being said; industry observers — and legislators stateside — will no doubt watch closely for the impact on investments once EU policymakers impose new restrictions on AI. Could Mistral someday grow to challenge OpenAI with the regulations in place? Or will the regulations have a chilling effect? It’s too early to say — but we’re eager to see ourselves.

Here are some other AI stories of note from the past few days:
• A new AI alliance: Meta, on an open source tear , wants to spread its influence in the ongoing battle for AI mindshare. The social network announced that it’s teaming up with IBM to launch the AI Alliance, an industry body to support “open innovation” and “open science” in AI — but ulterior motives abound.
• OpenAI turns to India: Ivan and Jagmeet report that OpenAI is working with former Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly as a senior advisor to facilitate talks with the government about AI policy. OpenAI is also looking to set up a local team in India, with Jaitly helping the AI startup navigate the Indian policy and regulatory landscape.
• Google launches AI-assisted note-taking: Google’s AI note-taking app, NotebookLM, which was announced earlier this year, is now available to U.S. users 18 years of age or older. To mark the launch, the experimental app got integration with Gemini Pro, Google’s new large language model, which Google says will “help with document understanding and reasoning.”
• OpenAI under regulatory scrutiny: The cozy relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft, a major backer and partner, is now the focus of a new inquiry launched by the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. over whether the two companies are effectively in a “relevant merger situation” after recent drama. The FTC is also reportedly looking into Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI in what appears to be a coordinated effort.
• Asking AI nicely: How can you reduce biases if they’re baked into an AI model from biases in its training data? Anthropic suggests asking it nicely to please, please not discriminate or someone will sue us. Yes, really. Devin has the full story
• Meta rolls out AI features: Alongside other AI-related updates this week, Meta AI, Meta’s generative AI experience, gained new capabilities including the ability to create images when prompted, as well as support for Instagram Reels. The former feature, called “reimagine,” lets users in group chats recreate AI images with prompts, while the latter can turn to Reels as a resource as needed.
• Respeecher gets cash: Ukrainian synthetic voice startup Respeecher — which is perhaps best known for being chosen to replicate James Earl Jones and his iconic Darth Vader voice for a Star Wars animated show, then later a younger Luke Skywalker for The Mandalorian — is finding success despite not just bombs raining down on their city, but a wave of hype that has raised up sometimes controversial competitors, Devin writes.
• Liquid neural nets: An MIT spinoff co-founded by robotics luminary Daniela Rus aims to build general-purpose AI systems powered by a relatively new type of AI model called a liquid neural network. Called Liquid AI, the company raised $37.5 million this week in a seed round from backers including WordPress parent company Automattic.

Orbital imagery is an excellent playground for machine learning models, since these days satellites produce more data than experts can possibly keep up with. EPFL researchers are looking into better identifying ocean-borne plastic, a huge problem but a very difficult one to track systematically. Their approach isn’t shocking — train a model on labeled orbital images — but they’ve refined the technique so that their system is considerably more accurate, even when there’s cloud cover.

Finding it is only part of the challenge, of course, and removing it is another, but the better intelligence people and organizations have when they perform the actual work, the more effective they will be.

Not every domain has so much imagery, however. Biologists in particular face a challenge in studying animals that are not adequately documented. For instance, they might want to track the movements of a certain rare type of insect, but due to a lack of imagery of that insect, automating the process is difficult. A group at Imperial College London is putting machine learning to work on this in collaboration with game development platform Unreal.

By creating photo-realistic scenes in Unreal and populating them with 3D models of the critter in question, be it an ant, stick insect or something bigger, they can create arbitrary amounts of training data for machine learning models. Though the computer vision system will have been trained on synthetic data, it can still be very effective in real-world footage, as their video shows.

You can read their paper in Nature Communications.

Not all generated imagery is so reliable, though, as University of Washington researchers found. They systematically prompted the open source image generator Stable Diffusion 2.1 to produce images of a “person” with various restrictions or locations. They showed that the term “person” is disproportionately associated with light-skinned, western men.

Not only that, but certain locations and nationalities produced unsettling patterns, like sexualized imagery of women from Latin American countries and “a near-complete erasure of nonbinary and Indigenous identities.” For instance, asking for pictures of “a person from Oceania” produces white men and no indigenous people, despite the latter being numerous in the region (not to mention all the other non-white-guy people). It’s all a work in progress, and being aware of the biases inherent in the data is important.

Learning how to navigate biased and questionably useful models is on a lot of academics’ minds — and those of their students. This interesting chat with Yale English professor Ben Glaser is a refreshingly optimistic take on how things like ChatGPT can be used constructively:

And when should they be trusted in, say, a hospital? Radiology is a field where AI is frequently being applied to help quickly identify problems in scans of the body, but it’s far from infallible. So how should doctors know when to trust the model and when not to? MIT seems to think that they can automate that part too — but don’t worry, it’s not another AI. Instead, it’s a standard, automated onboarding process that helps determine when a particular doctor or task finds an AI tool helpful, and when it gets in the way.

Increasingly, AI models are being asked to generate more than text and images. Materials are one place where we’ve seen a lot of movement — models are great at coming up with likely candidates for better catalysts, polymer chains and so on. Startups are getting in on it, but Microsoft also just released a model called MatterGen that’s “specifically designed for generating novel, stable materials.”

As you can see in the image above, you can target lots of different qualities, from magnetism to reactivity to size. No need for a Flubber-like accident or thousands of lab runs — this model could help you find a suitable material for an experiment or product in hours rather than months.

Google DeepMind and Berkeley Lab are also working on this kind of thing. It’s quickly becoming standard practice in the materials industry."
1145301925,20231209,"Yves here. It’s noteworthy to see that divisions are developing over the question of NATO membership for Ukraine, of course assuming anything other than a small rump state with fantasies of retaking the territory that joins Russia (and what if other European countries gobble up bits as supposed charity?). This is not as surprising as it may seem. One of the major Western fantasies for how to extract the US from Project Ukraine without having too much egg on its face is to somehow negotiate a ceasefire….when recall in March 2022, Russia kept prosecuting the war as it was negotiating. We did the same in the Vietnam peace talks. So any durable stop to the kinetic war is very likely to come at the end of, and not early in, negotiations. We still think any negotiated end to the war is vanishingly unlikely, for among other reasons that this is a war with the US and NATO, NATO cannot agree to any deal due to needing to have every state commit individually, which is na ga happen, and the Russian public would go berserk with any deal that did more than take a wee bit of sting out of a Ukraine capitulation. But the tidbit below, on the US trying to get Ukraine to shut up on the topic of NATO, does point to the US recognizing the Ukraine cause is lost. The more any members with influence in the Collective West keep talking up Ukraine membership in NATO, an absolute red line for Russia. the more it will cement the Russian view that it must continue the war until Ukraine is prostrated and it can install a complaint government.

 

 By Uriel Araujo, researcher with a focus on international and ethnic conflicts. Originally published at InfoBRICS US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is pressuring European diplomats to cease any talks about Ukraine joining NATO, according to a member of Rada (the Ukrainian parliament), Oleksiy Goncharenko. This is no minor politician. The son of a former Odessa mayor, he is a member of the Ukrainian Permanent Delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). The allegations were publicly made in a series of texts posted in his Telegram channel (in Ukrainian). He wrote: “Unfortunately, there will be no NATO [for Ukraine]. Forget about it – it won’t happen.” Goncharenko claims that “several sources” in Washington told him the topic of Ukraine’s accession to the Atlantic Alliance “annoys the US elite” and even “after war” the country should not expect it. The politician also commented on the ongoing friction between the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Valery Zaluzhny. According to Goncharenko, Washington is “not happy” about it. In addition, he says, one should expect the next aid package to Ukraine to be the last one: “In a year, at the end of 2024, we will not be given any more money… Most likely, we will switch to a credit form of cooperation. They’ll give a loan. Not a grant that won’t need to be repaid.” Could such allegations be a fabrication created for propaganda purposes? There is no reason to think so and the logic of it in this case would be far from clear. In fact, Goncharenko’s claims make perfect sense in light of what we already know by now. We know the US has been pressuring its ally to hold elections. Moreover, the US Mission to NATO last month posted on X (formerly Twitter) a vague message about Washington being “focused on setting the conditions for a just, durable, and sustainable peace” in Ukraine. We also know that European Union (EU) member states are divided over the bloc’s common budget, including additional funding for Kyiv in 2024. In addition, Pulitzer winner journalist Seymour Hersh has written that, according to his American diplomacy and intelligence sources, the aforementioned General Valery Zaluzhny has been directly negotiating a peace deal with Russian general Valery Gerasimov, independently of Zelensky, who is described as a “wild card”. According to the journalist: “The two generals may continue to talk and Putin may indeed be interested in a settlement that gives him permanent control of Crimea and the four provinces he has claimed, but Zelensky remains the wild card. The American official said that Zelensky has been told that “this is a military-to-military problem to solve and the talks will go on with or without you.” If necessary, the American official told me, “We can finance his voyage to the Caribbean’.” We know that the unprecedented sanctions against the Russian Federation have been backfiring since the beginning, with the Eurasian great power reaching record trade surplus as early as May 2022. That has sparked division within the European continent, and how de-industralized post-Nord Stream Europe has been hurt by the ongoing conflict and by American subsidy war. As early as April 2023, as I wrote, former US ambassador to Finland, Earle Mack wrote that the US-led West had been “propping up Ukraine to fight a proxy war” but he could only see “a decade of death and chaos” for the country. In May Zelensky was planning a number of bold actions against Russia, including bombing the Druzhba pipeline that provides Russian oil to Hungary (a NATO member), and even occupying Russian villages plus targeting the Russian Federation with long-range missiles. Such plans crossed some red lines and were a huge problem from the point of view of both the US and that of Ukraine’s neighbors. That same month, aforementioned Serymour Hersh also reported that countries such as Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and the Czech Republic, led by Poland (with Germany playing some role in it too) had been pressuring the Ukrainian leader “to find a way to end the war, even by resigning himself if necessary, and to allow the process of rebuilding his nation to get under way.” According to Hersh’s CIA source at the time, these European leaders had “made it clear that ‘Zelensky can keep what he’s got – a villa in Italy and interests in offshore bank accounts – ‘if he works up a peace deal even if he’s got to be paid off, if it’s the only way to get a deal’.” Few months later, in September, Poland stopped sending Ukraine weapons, allegedly over a trade dispute, as bilateral relations deteriorated. All of this points to a clear picture emerging, one that had been haunting Ukraine for a while: Western abandonment and betrayal – something of which Washington has a solid record. From an European perspective, the picture is even more dramatic: it is about the bloc’s own interests. As I wrote, in December 2021, American and European energy interests are far from converging and in fact the energy crisis in that part of the Old World is something that has benefited Washington, while hurting its European allies – and the same can be said about the American proxy attrition war in Eastern Europe. It is about time to admit NATO’s expansion has been a recipe for disaster and about time to admit Ukraine has a far-right problem and a problem with the way it deals with the Russian minority – and not just in Donbass. And all of that is a problem for Europe, too. It remains to be seen how European leaders will conduct their policy pertaining to Ukraine and also to the strategic energy interests of the continent. One may expect many European voices urging the bloc to reconsider sanctions against Russia, for instance, as has been the case already. For a start, it could reconsider its stance on the issue of the rights of ethnic minorities."

1145309473,20231209,"After lengthy negotiations, European Union officials have reached an agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act, a set of comprehensive regulations surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) that could provide a blueprint for other nations and regions aiming to limit the dangers of AI.

At this point, negotiators have only agreed on what EU lawmakers will ultimately vote on rather than enacted any actual regulations. The European Parliament, comprised of more than 700 members, will vote on the AI Act by the end of the month or early next year, and any ratified legislation will not go into effect until 2025 at the earliest.

As the United States and United Kingdom, among others, rapidly work to legislate and guide the development and deployment of AI technologies, the EU, as if often the case, is first across the line with proposed legislation.

The AI Act is far-reaching, determining safeguards for the general use of AI, limiting how law enforcement agencies can use biometric identification, banning AI from manipulating social media users, providing consumers the right to lodge official complaints about AI, and outlining massive punishments for violators.

“This regulation aims to ensure that fundamental rights, democracy, the rule of law and environmental sustainability are protected from high risk AI, while boosting innovation and making Europe a leader in the field. The rules establish obligations for AI based on its potential risks and level of impact,” writes the European Parliament in an official press release.

“It was long and intense, but the effort was worth it. Thanks to the European Parliament’s resilience, the world’s first horizontal legislation on artificial intelligence will keep the European promise — ensuring that rights and freedoms are at the center of the development of this ground-breaking technology,” says co-rapporteur Brando Benifei (S&D, Italy). “Correct implementation will be key — the Parliament will continue to keep a close eye, to ensure support for new business ideas with sandboxes, and effective rules for the most powerful models.”

The agreed-upon iteration of the provisional AI Act includes numerous “banned applications.” One such banned use of AI is categorization based on “sensitive characteristics” like political affiliation, religious beliefs, philosophical ideologies, sexual orientation, or race. The AI Act also prohibits untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases.

Additional banned applications include using AI to measure and recognize the emotional state of employees and companies doing “social scoring based on social behavior and personal characteristics.”

Two more banned applications are more general and perhaps the most important. The AI Act says that companies cannot deploy “AI systems that manipulate human behavior to circumvent their free will” or “exploit the vulnerabilities of people (due to their age, disability, social or economic situation).”

The AI Act has been years in the making, with the first draft having arrived in April 2021, long before many of the most widespread AI technologies had ever reached the public. The rapidity with which AI systems are developed, deployed, and proliferated makes highly targeted legislation remarkably challenging. The EU has opted for a more general approach, aiming to limit the risk of AI at its source.

To that end, as promised, the final version of the AI Act requires companies to disseminate details concerning how their AI models are trained, and perhaps most importantly, requires companies to comply with EU copyright law. How this will shape the training of image generation models, many of which have shady origins, will be extremely interesting.

More generally, any AI system classified as high-risk due to potential harm to health, safety, rights, the environment, democracy, and the rule of law will be subject to a fundamental rights impact assessment. Under the AI Act, citizens can file official complaints against high-risk AI systems and receive explanations concerning how the EU has assessed a specific AI system.

“The EU is the first in the world to set in place robust regulation on AI, guiding its development and evolution in a human-centric direction. The AI Act sets rules for large, powerful AI models, ensuring they do not present systemic risks to the Union and offers strong safeguards for our citizens and our democracies against any abuses of technology by public authorities. It protects our SMEs, strengthens our capacity to innovate and lead in the field of AI, and protects vulnerable sectors of our economy. The European Union has made impressive contributions to the world; the AI Act is another one that will significantly impact our digital future,” says co-rapporteur Dragos Tudorache (Renew, Romania).

The AI Act also aims to nurture the development of innovative AI systems. The provisional law includes promoting “regulatory sandboxes” and other real-world testing environments where companies, especially smaller ones, can develop and train innovative AI systems before they are released to the general public.

As for the AI Act’s teeth, the EU negotiators have also agreed on potential punishments, ranging from fines up to 35 million euros ($37.7 million) or 7% of a company’s “global turnover,” depending on the severity of the infringement and the offending company’s size."

It says member states should “consider the possibility of a standalone sanction regime”.

Sanctions against ‘’extremist’’ settlers in the West Bank, including visa bans, as well as tougher crackdown on Hamas terrorist group, are among measures to be discussed Monday during a meeting of European Union Foreign Ministers in Brussels.

The war between Israel and Hamas will top the meeting’s agenda.

According to a senior EU official, EU’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell has submitted the member states seven ‘’lines of action’’ with concrete proposals that will be discussed. ‘’These seven lines of action are guiding principles that we have sustained for a long time and we are trying to adapt them to the new situation,’’ he said.

Among the lines of action is to react to ‘’extremist’’ Israeli settlers in the West Bank and restrictive measures against Hamas leaders.

This may include visa bans against extremists attacking civilians.

‘’In the framework of preserving the possibility of a Palestinian state with the West Bank and Gaza we have pointed to the possibility of taking measures against those extremist settlers that are against the two-state solution and the presence of the Palestinians in the West Bank,’’ the senior official said.

‘’We have seen that the Israeli army has not taken due action against these illegal acts. Israel has under international law and as occupying power the obligation to deal with these issues. So we are condiering inside the EU the possibility of taking measures against particular persons, individuazls. The Americans have alreazdy gone ahead with that, we are talking to them. It is important to take these measures in the framework of preserving the West Bank as a Palestinian territory,’’ he said.

The US has already announced it will deny visas to Israeli settlers responsible for undermining peace and security. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo also said this week that his country “will work with the US” and that “extremist settlers in the West Bank will be banned from entering Belgium.’’ France last month also said last month that the European Union should consider sanctioning violent Israeli settlers who attack Palestinians in the West Bank. “We believe that the international community has a role to play to end these acts of violence which are extremely destabilizing for the region, but also harm the prospects for a two-state solution,” foreign ministry spokesperson Anne-Claire Legendre said during a briefing.

The lines of action also call for tougher sanctions against Hamas, which the EU considers a terrorist organisation since 2003, by tightening the screw further on its leadership and financing. It says member states should “consider the possibility of a standalone sanction regime”.

“Hamas is an organisation with quite a strong capacity to act. That needs financing, in particular, for its weapons. So it’s obvious that being only a terrorist organisation cannot be, apparently, reason enough for dissuading some people to finance Hamas,” the senior EU diplomat said.

‘’The fact that Hamas is considered a terrorist organisation by the EU has a number of implications on how to deal with this organisation, their members, their financing. After the terrible things that happened on the 7th of October we want to make the political and practical point of reinforcing the sanctions against Hamas. We have already on the table some proposals mostly a message to some leaders of Hamas and also to the financing of the organisation. This is already something that has been discussed and we expect that there will be an agreement, but we don’t know yet when,’’ the senior EU official said."

1145327603,20231209,"“No one but us will step into this battle for the hearts and the minds of our fellow citizens. So we need to do it and win,” imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said in an online statement relayed from behind bars.

Although they believe Putin will be declared the winner no matter how voters cast their ballots, they say they hope to undermine the widespread public support he enjoys, turn popular opinion against the devastating war he unleashed on Ukraine, and show those who oppose it already that they are not alone.

TALLINN, Estonia — Behind bars in penal colonies or in self-exile abroad, Russian opposition figures vow they will still put up a fight against President Vladimir Putin as he seeks yet another term in office in an election in March.

Putin, 71, announced Friday that he will run for president again, to pile another six years onto his two dozen in power. He could even run again in 2030.

The vote is scheduled for March 15-17, with his victory all but assured. The vast majority of opposition figures are either imprisoned or have fled the country, almost all independent news outlets have been blocked, and any criticism has been muted by a slew of repressive laws adopted over the last decade.

“This is, basically, a guarantee that (the Kremlin) can declare any result whatsoever,” said Nikolay Petrov, visiting researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, in an interview with The Associated Press.

Some activists agree there is no point in trying to influence the election's outcome. They say they will take advantage of the election campaign to press their views about Putin and his government — a time when “Russians will be more politically active than usual,” according to Leonid Volkov, Navalny's top strategist and chief of staff.

“Our task is to make sure that the issues we will be able to raise and bring into the public agenda in January, February, March stick — stick with Russians even after the election,” said Volkov, who left Russia several years ago.

To that end, Volkov and his team launched a project called “Navalny’s Campaigning Machine.” The idea is simple — talk to as many Russians as possible, either by phone or online, and convince them “to turn against the candidates we hate: candidate Putin and candidate ‘War,’” as Navalny himself put it in an online post announcing the project in June.

In late October, the project already had about 170 volunteers making the calls, Volkov said, and was conducting a survey to figure out the specific grievances and needs of people in order to tailor talking points they would use in future phone calls.

Volkov said that out of the thousands of calls already made, only a handful of people said they were completely content with everything happening in Russia and beyond.

Others had at least one complaint. “Someone is discontented over the war, someone is discontented with the economic situation, someone is unhappy with the health care system, social justice — lots of things,” Volkov said.

There are questions that “the authorities can’t answer,” and by raising them with the Russians, the team hopes to cause “political problems” for the Kremlin, Volkov said. The authorities' inability to address these issues ""will elicit frustration and pain, political problems for Putin that will only grow,” he added.

On the eve of Putin’s announcement, the team placed a number of billboards — in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities — that read “Russia” and “Happy New Year,” with links and QR codes leading to a website titled “Russia without Putin.” The website urges people “to convince at least 10 people to act against Putin” and talks about various ways to campaign.

The Anti-War Committee — another opposition force that unites prominent activists in exile such as former tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, chess legend Garry Kasparov and former lawmakers turned opposition politicians Gennady Gudkov and his son, Dmitry Gudkov — also plans a campaign called “No to Putin!”

Gennady Gudkov told AP that the general goal of the campaign is to explain to Russians “what the future could be like without Putin” — no war, no repressions, with the government focusing on things like the economy, science and education.

A possible election day tactic, Gudkov said, could be to urge Putin critics to go to the polls at a specified time so that long lines form to show how many people oppose him: “If the country, the elites, the world will see long queues of people who clearly disagree with Putin’s policies, it will be enough.”

One group, however, believes there is mileage in putting forward candidates to challenge Putin at the polls. A project called Our Headquarters, launched by several activists helping those fleeing Russia to settle abroad, promises to support “democratic candidates with an antiwar position.”

Project coordinator Andrei Davydov told AP that they can offer help to prospective candidates with the campaign and the procedural side of things, like assembling a group of 500 people required by law to put forward an independent candidate, or with gathering and verifying 300,000 signatures needed to register on the ballot.

To get support from Our Headquarters, a candidate must oppose the war and be willing to release political prisoners and implement democratic reforms in Russia, Davydov said. The project has already endorsed one candidate: Yekaterina Duntsova, a journalist and lawyer from the Tver region north of Moscow, who once was a member of local legislature. Davydov said they were in talks with a few others.

“We need to give people hope, to give people a chance to speak out. There are no other legal possibilities (to speak out) in Russia these days, other than by supporting an antiwar candidate,” he said. “The minimum task is (get) people to understand that there are many of them, and they need to act, to defend their position.""

A more ambitious goal is to register an opposition candidate to challenge Putin on the ballot, Davydov said. “We will work toward a result, a victory, and see what happens,” he added.

Navalny urged his supporters in an online statement to go to the polls on election day and vote ""for any other candidate"" — a strategy akin to the one he proposed in 2012, when Putin ran for president after a four-year hiatus as prime minister due to presidential term limits. That balloting, as well as an election for parliament months earlier, brought out huge protests that spooked the Kremlin and led to a crackdown on dissent.

Then, in 2018, Navalny called for a boycott of the balloting after he was barred from the race.

Since then, Navalny’s team organized a voting strategy of promoting local candidates with the best chance to defeat those backed by the Kremlin’s United Russia party. It has not yet been used in a presidential election.

Navalny's ally Ivan Zhdanov told AP the team will propose some other actions on election day, but refused to give details.

Maria Pevchikh, head of the board of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, urged the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom to “make Putin’s reelection more painful” by promising sanctions against any celebrities endorsing him.

“It’s one thing to change your profile picture and say you are on the Putin Team. It’s a completely different thing to actually lose everything, including your bank accounts, for participating in Putin’s ‘election’ campaign. We must increase the cost of such a decision,” she said. Governments have not responded publicly to her proposal.

Petrov, the researcher, believes the Kremlin's biggest fear from the election would be that Putin's image might be damaged.

The election “must happen quietly, calmly and show that the people accept the authorities the way they are. And in this respect, it is very important to the Kremlin to avoid any hiccups, scandals, that may cast doubt on the result that will be declared,” Petrov said."

Georgians stage a pro-EU march in the capital Tbilisi on Saturday, days before the bloc is expected to put the Black Sea nation on a formal membership path (AFP photo)

TBILISI — Georgian non-governmental organisations staged a pro-European Union march in the capital Tbilisi on Saturday, a week ahead of the bloc’s decision on granting the country membership candidacy status.

EU leaders are set to discuss putting Tbilisi on a formal membership path and to launch accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova during a European Council meeting on December 14-15.

President Salome Zurabishvili joined the rally at Tbilisi’s Europe Square where demonstrators unfolded a 33 metre-long and 22 metre-wide EU flag, which organisers claimed to be the “largest in the world”.

She said she counted on EU leaders to grant her country candidate status, but also expressed concern over the position of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

He has threatened to block key decisions concerning Ukraine at the upcoming EU summit — risking to impact Georgia’s chances of obtaining candidate status at the same time.

“It would be extremely serious if Orban — under the influence of Russia — could force the European Union to go against decisions that lead towards a common European future, towards the shared freedom of Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova in the European space,” Zurabishvili said.

EU chief Charles Michel met Orban on November 27 to ease tensions, while French President Emmanuel Macron hosted him in Paris on Thursday in a bid to break the deadlock over Ukraine.

Beating drums, waving EU banners and Georgia’s five-cross flags, several hundred representatives of Georgian NGOs, marched on Saturday along Tbilisi’s main thoroughfare, Rustaveli Avenue.

“Georgians’ unity holds decisive importance on our path towards the EU,” the march organisers said in a statement. “We must once again demonstrate our unity and ensure our voice is heard.”

Demonstrators expressed optimism over Georgia’s chances to advance on its EU accession path.

“I’m sure we will get EU candidacy because we, Georgians, belong to Europe,” one of the rally participants, student Marika Gerliani, 20, told AFP.

Another demonstrator, 60-year-old mathematician Nika Tvauri, said: “It’s about Georgia returning home. Hello Europe, goodbye Russia.”

Georgia applied for EU membership alongside Ukraine and Moldova after Russia invaded its pro-Western neighbour in February 2022.

EU leaders have granted candidate status to Kyiv and Chisinau but urged Tbilisi to first implement judicial and electoral reforms, improve press freedom and curtail the power of oligarchs."

'Europe reaches a deal on the world’s first comprehensive AI rules'

European Union negotiators clinched a deal Friday on the world’s first comprehensive artificial intelligence rules, paving the way for legal oversight of AI technology...

Civil society groups, however, gave it a cool reception as they wait for technical details that will need to be ironed out in the coming weeks. They said the deal didn’t go far enough in protecting people from harm caused by AI systems.

“Today’s political deal marks the beginning of important and necessary technical work on crucial details of the AI Act, which are still missing,” said Daniel Friedlaender, head of the European office of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a tech industry lobby group...

The European Parliament will still need to vote on the act early next year...

Now, the U.S., U.K., China and global coalitions like the Group of 7 major democracies have jumped in with their own proposals to regulate AI, though they’re still catching up to Europe.

Strong and comprehensive rules from the EU “can set a powerful example for many governments considering regulation,” said Anu Bradford, a Columbia Law School professor...

The AI Act was originally designed to mitigate the dangers from specific AI functions based on their level of risk, from low to unacceptable. But lawmakers pushed to expand it to foundation models, the advanced systems that underpin general purpose AI services like ChatGPT...

The companies building foundation models will have to draw up technical documentation, comply with EU copyright law and detail the content used for training. The most advanced foundation models that pose “systemic risks” will face extra scrutiny...

What became the thorniest topic was AI-powered face recognition surveillance systems... European lawmakers wanted a full ban on public use of face scanning and other “remote biometric identification” systems because of privacy concerns. But governments of member countries succeeded in negotiating exemptions so law enforcement could use them to tackle serious crimes like child sexual exploitation or terrorist attacks.

Rights groups said they were concerned about the exemptions and other big loopholes in the AI Act, including lack of protection for AI systems used in migration and border control, and the option for developers to opt-out of having their systems classified as high risk.

“Whatever the victories may have been in these final negotiations, the fact remains that huge flaws will remain in this final text,” said Daniel Leufer, a senior policy analyst at the digital rights group Access Now."

1145422697,20231210,"A Philippine boat and a Chinese Coast Guard ship have collided near a hotly contested reef, with both countries trading blame for the latest confrontation in the disputed South China Sea.

The incident on Sunday happened during a Philippine resupply mission to a tiny garrison on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, which is a flashpoint for Manila and Beijing.

It came a day after the Philippines accused the Chinese coast guard of using water cannons to ""obstruct"" three government boats delivering provisions to Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal, off the main island of Luzon.

The Philippines on Monday summoned China's envoy over the tense confrontations.

Diplomatic protests had been filed and ""the Chinese ambassador has also been summoned"", foreign ministry spokeswoman Teresita Daza told a news conference.

Ms Daza said declaring China's ambassador Huang Xilian as ""persona non grata"" in the Philippines was also ""something that has to be seriously considered"".

Longstanding tensions between Manila and Beijing over the sea have flared in recent months following multiple incidents involving Philippine and Chinese vessels, including two previous collisions.

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including waters and islands near the shores of its neighbours, and has ignored an international tribunal ruling that its assertions have no legal basis.

It deploys boats to patrol the busy waterway and has built artificial islands that it has militarised to reinforce its claims.

The Philippines said on Sunday: ""China Coast Guard and Chinese Maritime Militia vessels harassed, blocked, and executed dangerous manoeuvres on Philippine civilian supply vessels.""

One of two boats carrying provisions was ""rammed"" by a Chinese coast guard ship, the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea said in a statement.

A Chinese ship also used water cannons against the two supply boats and a Philippine Coast Guard vessel escorting the mission, the multi-agency task force said.

That caused ""severe damage"" to the engine of one of the supply boats and damaged the mast of the coast guard vessel, it said.

Jonathan Malaya, assistant director general of the Philippine National Security Council, told reporters on Monday that China's ramming and water cannoning of Filipino boats was a ""serious escalation"" of their tactics.

The China Coast Guard, however, accused the Philippine boat of ""deliberately colliding"" with the Chinese vessel after ""disregarding our multiple stern warnings"".

The Philippine boat ""changed direction suddenly in an unprofessional, dangerous manner, deliberately colliding with our Coast Guard Vessel 21556, which was on a normal law enforcement rout, and caused a scrape,"" the Chinese Coast Guard said in a statement.

It took ""control measures"" against the other Philippine supply boat, which was allegedly ""carrying construction materials"" to the grounded warship on which the garrison is located.

Foreign diplomats in Manila were swift to criticise the Chinese actions.

US ambassador MaryKay Carlson said the United States stood with ""the Philippines and partners in vehemently condemning the PRC's repeated illegal and dangerous actions against Philippine vessels"", using the acronym for China's official name.

European Union ambassador Luc Veron said Sunday's incident was ""deeply troubling"", while the New Zealand embassy said the country was ""deeply concerned at multiple incidents of dangerous actions towards the Philippines"".

Hours after the latest incident, a convoy of civilian boats planning to deliver provisions to Filipino fishermen and troops in the South China Sea aborted the trip after ""constant shadowing"" by Chinese vessels, the organiser said.

The convoy, which departed the western island of Palawan early on Sunday, had already changed course to avoid Second Thomas Shoal and go directly to Philippine-held Nanshan Island, where they would leave their cargo.

Second Thomas Shoal is about 200 kilometres from the western Philippine island of Palawan, and more than 1,000 km from China's nearest major landmass, Hainan island.

A handful of Filipino troops are stationed on the crumbling BRP Sierra Madre, which the Philippine Navy grounded on the reef in 1999 to check China's advance in the waters.

The troops depend on the resupply missions for their survival.

One of the supply boats was able to deliver its cargo on Sunday, while the one involved in the collision was being towed by a Philippine Coast Guard vessel to Palawan, the task force said.

Relations between Manila and Beijing have deteriorated under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who has sought to improve ties with traditional ally Washington and push back against Chinese actions in the South China sea.

Mr Marcos warned last month that the situation in the waters had become ""more dire""."

1145437332,20231210,"An independent Consultant on Agriculture and Rural Development, Professor, Johnson Ekpere, has warned Nigeria farmers against the use of hazardous pesticides, saying they do not increase food production rather killing Nigerians slowly.

Prof. Ekpere stated this recently in Abuja during a joint press briefing organised by Alliance for Action on Pesticides in Nigeria (AAPN) and Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) to present the communique from the workshop on pesticides and human rights and dossier on registered and unregistered pesticides in the Nigerian market.

According to Ekpere, the popular assumption that pesticides increase food production is false.

He said that most of these chemicals are banned in countries that produced them and are pushed to Africa who use them unknowingly.

The Prof further stated that using these chemicals is a human right issue, and therefore enjoined all Nigerians to seek out other alternatives.

Another Professor of Agricultural Processing and Storage, Department of Agricultural, University of Agriculture, Makudi, and the National President, National Association of Yam Farmers, Processors and Marketers, Professor Simon Irtwanga also called on the government to ensure that those selling harmful pesticides in Nigerian markets are held accountable for the health hazard it is causing Nigerians.

According to him, these products are dangerous for both humans and animals, and are responsible for most chronic diseases that have enormous economic, health and environmental costs on Nigerians. He therefore raised the need for legislation to protect Nigerians.

Similarly, Health Of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), Dr. Nnimmo Bassey said dependence on pesticides for improved crop yield and food sufficiency comes at a cost to both the environment, health and economy especially when regulatory oversight is not properly implemented.

Bassey, who was represented by Deputy Executive Director at Environment Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria, Bar. Marian Bassey-Orovwuje said, exposure to pesticides have led to various adverse effects ranging from soil and water contamination, harm to microorganisms, and to human health disorders.

He stressed that farmers therefore deserve a right to know the pesticides they are using as well as its composition to enable them to make informed choices about their exposure to such chemicals.

The National Coordinator, Alliance For Pesticides In Nigeria (AAPN), Donald Ikenna, recommended that while pesticides are important, the accompanying health hazards are very high.

He said thousands of cancer cases are being reported yearly, and over 20 million Nigerians are suffering from chronic kidney disease.

“From the surveys we have done in the past; lots of Nigerian farmers do not know how to properly apply pesticides.

“Nigerians poorly manage how these agro-chemicals are being used. Over 50% of registered pesticides in Nigeria are hazardous. Nigerian beans, and other food items are banned in the European Union due to pesticides and other safety issues, as some of these chemicals are carcinogenic, and the dossier is expected to sensitise both government, consumers, and investors alike,” he said."

Mohammadi, 51, was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize in October for her decades of activism despite numerous arrests by Iranian authorities and spending years behind bars. She is renowned for campaigning for women's rights and democracy in her country, as well as fighting against the death penalty.

Daughter Kiana read the first part of the Nobel Peace Prize lecture in their mother's name, and her brother continued it.

''I write this message from behind the high, cold walls of a prison,"" Mohammadi said in the speech. ""I am a Middle Eastern woman, and come from a region which, despite its rich civilization, is now trapped amid war, the fire of terrorism, and extremism.''

''I am confident that the light of freedom and justice will shine brightly on the land of Iran,"" she said. ""At that moment, we will celebrate the victory of democracy and human rights over tyranny and authoritarianism, and the anthem of the people's triumph on the streets of Iran will resonate worldwide.

In the presence of Norway's King Harald and Queen Sonja and other dignitaries, Berit Reiss-Andersen, chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, cited Mohammadi's ''life-long struggle in support of human rights and strong civil society.''

A large portrait on display showed Mohammadi in pastel colors and smiling.

''She has asked us to use this particular photograph, which expresses how she wants to lead her life, looking happy in colorful garments, exposing her hair and with a steady gaze towards us,'' Reiss-Andersen said.

''No punishment has stopped her,'' Reiss-Andersen said, citing the sentences of imprisonment and over 150 lashes that have been imposed on her. She said when Mohammadi needed medical treatment recently, she was told she would be taken to a hospital on condition she wear a hijab. She refused, and was eventually taken to a different medical facility.

''When everything has been denied her, she still mobilizes the willpower and courage to make a statement,"" Reiss-Andersen said.

""This year's Peace Prize recognizes the brave women in Iran and around the world who fight for basic human rights and for an end to the discrimination and against segregation of women.""

In their speeches, Mohammadi's children both expressed regret that their mother wasn't allowed to be present in Oslo.

''She should have been here herself, but she was prevented by the executioners. I lend my voice to hers, and to all the girls and women of Iran whom nothing can silence,'' Kiana Rahmani said in Farsi at the beginning of her speech given in French.

Her brother noted that their mother's ''body is behind bars but her pen and thoughts have burst through the walls and reached us.""

''She and the Iranian people have never been more oppressed than now. But never has their voice resonated so strongly in the world. Let us continue to spread the reverberation so that Narges Mohammadi and the Iranian people will one day be able to break their chains,'' he said.

At a news conference in Oslo on Saturday, Kiana Rahmani read out a message from her mother in which she praised the role international media played in ''conveying the voice of dissenters, protesters and human rights defenders to the world.''

''Iranian society needs global support and you, journalists and media professionals are our greatest and most important allies in the difficult struggle against the destructive tyranny of the Islamic Republic government. I sincerely thank you for your efforts, for all you've done for us,'' Mohammadi said.

Kiana Rahmani said she held little hope of seeing her mother again.

''Maybe I'll see her in 30 or 40 years, but I think I won't see her again. But that doesn't matter, because my mother will always live on in my heart, values that are worth fighting for,'' she said.

Mohammadi's brother and husband told reporters that she planned to go on a hunger strike on Sunday in solidarity with the Baha'i Faith religious minority in Iran.

Mohammadi's husband, Taghi, was in the audience to watch their children accept the prestigious prize. He had previously said that he hadn't been able to see his wife for 11 years, while their children hadn't seen their mother for nearly eight years.

Mohammadi played a leading role in protests triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini last year while in police custody for allegedly violating the country's strict headscarf law, which forces women to cover their hair and entire bodies.

Iranian authorities banned members of Amini's family from traveling to accept the European Union's top human rights prize — the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought — on her behalf, the U.S.-based HRANA said late Saturday.

Narges Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003.

It's the fifth time in the 122-year history of the awards that the peace prize has been given to someone who is in prison or under house arrest.

The rest of the Nobel prizes were handed out in a separate ceremony in Stockholm later Sunday.

1145442434,20231210,"Getting from Belgium to France by boat will become much easier following the long-awaited reopening of the Condé-Pommeroeul canal, after a comprehensive works programme that began in 2016.

The Franco-Belgian waterway, essential for the transport of goods across the border, will again be open for large-scale navigation by the end of the year.

Boats weighing up to 3,000 tonnes will be able to navigate the 11km-long canal. This is good news for boatmen, who will avoid a 30km detour via the Nimy-Blaton-Péronnes canal and so will save half a day’s journey.

The reopening of the canal was also made in the spirit of encouraging greener and more sustainable transport, Wallonia’s minister for transport, Philippe Henry (Ecolo) said.

“It is very important for Wallonia to be on the European waterways network map. This is a huge economic issue. And it is also an ecological matter. Companies will have to decarbonise their transport and activities in future. We must therefore give them the means to do so.”

Depending on what journey is made, river transport of a tonne of goods over a kilometre emits two to five times less greenhouse gases and almost two times fewer PM2.5 fine particulates, which cause air pollution and resulting health problems such as heart disease and asthma, than road transport.

The Condé-Pommeroeul canal, running from Pommeroeul in Belgium to Condé-sur-l’Escaut in France, is, with the adjoining Lys canal and Dunkirk-Escaut link, one of the three branches of the Seine-Escaut corridor that runs into the large river networks of Northern Europe.

It enables a direct river connection between the larger French and Belgian canals, notably the canal from Charleroi, Brussels and Antwerp to the Meuse river.

The newly reopened canal was shut for navigation in 1992 because of a silt problem between Hensies lock and the Grand Large de Fresnes.

Significant dredging and recalibration work was necessary, including extracting one million cubic metres of sediment and moving 450,000m³ of earth to widen the waterway.

This €116 million renovation project was carried out by the Voies Navigables de France (VNF), the French navigation authority responsible for the majority of France's inland waterways network and associated facilities and the Walloon public service. Financial support came from the European Union and the Hauts-de-France region."

1145452066,20231210,"CHINESE ships on Sunday fired water cannons at three Philippine vessels on a resupply mission to a military outpost at Second Thomas Shoal, as tensions over claims in the South China Sea escalate.

The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) also accused China of ramming a smaller resupply boat, while China’s coast guard said the Philippine vessel had intentionally rammed its ship.

Two Philippine Navy-operated supply boats and Philippine coast guard escort ships were on their way to deliver food and other supplies to BRP Sierra Madre when Chinese coast guard and maritime militia vessels “harassed” them and “executed dangerous maneuvers” at close range, a national task force said in a statement.

It said the water cannon attack by Chinese Coast Guard vessel 5204 had caused severe damage to the engines of a smaller boat named M/L Kalayaan, disabling the vessel and “seriously endangering the lives of its crew.”

The fiberglass boat, owned by the municipal government of Kalayaan, was towed back to Palawan province after the incident, it said. The local government has jurisdiction over Second Thomas Shoal and other features in the Kalayaan Island Group — the northeastern section of the Spratly Islands.

The Philippine Coast Guard’s patrol-class BRP Cabra suffered damage to its mast after being directly targeted by the full strength of the water cannon, the Philippine task force said.

Also subjected to China’s “reckless and dangerous harassment at close range” was Unaizah Mae 1 (UM1), which was allegedly rammed by Chinese Coast Guard vessel 21556.

“Despite these extreme and reckless actions, UM1 successfully reached BRP Sierra Madre,” the task force said.

The Chinese ships’ aggression undermines stability in the region “in defiance of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” US Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay L. Carlson said in an X post.

European Union Ambassador Luc Veron described the Sunday attack as “deeply troubling,” saying “water cannons and dangerous sea maneuvers aren’t a legitimate alternative.”

French envoy Marie Fontanel said France is “seriously concerned” about the use of water cannons within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ). “France recalls the value of international law to ensure freedom of navigation.”

Second Thomas Shoal is about 200 kilometers from the Philippine island of Palawan and more than 1,000 kilometers from China’s nearest major landmass, Hainan Island.

The Philippine task force China’s claim that its actions were a legitimate exercise of law enforcement measures “has no basis in international law.”

“Further, we express grave concern over the deliberate disinformation conducted through official channels that distort facts on the ground,” it said.

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion (P167 trillion) of annual ship-borne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. A United Nations-backed tribunal in 2016 said China’s claims had no legal basis.

Beijing and Manila have been playing cat-and-mouse around the uninhabited Second Thomas Shoal in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone when the Philippines deploys resupply missions for Filipino soldiers living aboard an aging warship deliberately run aground in 1999 to protect Manila’s maritime claims.

‘MORAL HIGH GROUND’

 On Saturday, Chinese Coast Guard maritime militia ships used water cannons to prevent three research vessels of the Philippines fishery bureau from delivering supplies to Filipino fisherfolk near Scarborough Shoal, which is about 120 nautical miles west of the Philippine island of Luzon.

The three research vessels of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources were hit several times by the Chinese Coast Guard ships, which started their blocking attempts at about 8 a.m., while the Philippine vessels were still 15 nautical miles (28 kilometers) from the shoal.

In Sunday’s incident, China’s coast guard said in a statement that two Philippine vessels, ignoring repeated warnings, had “illegally entered the waters adjacent to Ren’ai Reef in the Nansha Islands without the approval of the Chinese government.”

It said Unaizah Mae 1 “made an unprofessional and dangerous sudden turn, intentionally ramming into China Coast Guard vessel 21556.” It said the Philippine side bore full responsibility.

Senate President Juan Miguel F. Zubiri said President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. should “send the current Chinese Ambassador home” since “he has done nothing to address the continued attacks of his government on our troops and on our people.”

Speaker Martin G. Romualdez said China’s aggression against Filipino fisherfolk is “not only a violation of their rights but also an affront to human dignity.”

“To prevent the distribution of humanitarian support, as was the case in this incident, is not only illegal but also inhumane,” he said, demanding that Beijing “take immediate and concrete actions to cease these aggressive activities and uphold the principles of international law.”

“We will neither be intimidated, nor will we stand down in the face of these unwarranted and illegal actions,” said the House leader. The House of Representatives has taken steps to boost funding for agencies on the frontline of defending Philippine-occupied features in the South China Sea.

Don Mclain Gill, who teaches international relations at De La Salle University in Manila, said the Philippines has not been using water cannons to fight back because it wants to keep engaging China “while maintaining the moral high ground.”

“This also illustrates Manila’s consistent approach of being on the defensive while keeping channels open,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat.

Raymond Powell, a fellow at Stanford University’s Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, said China wants nothing more than for the Philippines to meekly go back to the negotiating table, “where China holds all the cards and can bargain from a position of strength.”

“The Philippines’ assertive transparency campaign has imposed severe reputational costs on China and rallied international opinion to its side — this is real leverage and should not be abandoned for empty promises,” he said in an X message.

“Beijing will continue to pursue its narrowly driven interests in the West Philippine Sea at the expense of our sovereignty and sovereign rights whether we securitize it or not at the domestic level,” Mr. Gill said.

In a related development, China and Japan accused each other of maritime incursions after a confrontation between their coast guards in waters around disputed islands in the East China Sea.

China’s coast guard said on Sunday a Japanese fishing boat and several patrol vessels intruded the previous day into waters around the tiny islands, called Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan.

The uninhabited islands are controlled by Japan but also claimed by China.

China’s coast guard said in a statement it had taken necessary measures in accordance with the law to warn away the Japanese vessels.

Japan’s coast guard said on Saturday that two Chinese maritime patrol boats left Japan’s territorial waters around the islands after receiving warnings. It said its patrol vessels were protecting a Japanese fishing boat that had been approached by the Chinese ships.

1145455366,20231210,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 10 December 2023 - Africa and the European Union should strengthen their partnership on the ocean governance and the blue economy under the Africa – Europe cooperation to empower the local communities and help mitigate climate change, climate change experts at a side event at COP 28 say.

The side event on Leveraging African Leadership on Ocean Governance and Blue Economy: Strengthening cross-continental cooperation was organized in partnership with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), and the African Union Development Agency - New Partnership for Africa's Development (AUDA-NEPAD).

Jean-Paul Adam, Director, Policy, Monitoring and Advocacy in the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa to the UNSG said the ocean is critical to accelerating global climate and biodiversity action, providing food security and promoting a sustainable development for millions of people. However, ocean cooperation is not yet central to the AU-EU dialogue.

“Unsustainable human activities and their harmful impacts continue to degrade the ocean leading to profound changes and hampering the much- needed achievement of the UN 2030 and AU 2063 Agendas,” said Mr. Adam.

“Current mode of fishing in Africa are extractive. In contrast Local community have less value addition and limited participation in the value chain. We need to change this into a sustainable value chain like investing in renewable energy for cold chain.”

The AU he said has recognized the blue economy in agenda 2063. There is therefore a need to translate this into specific strategy. It is also fundamental to acknowledge the June 2023 Moroni Declaration for Ocean and Climate Action in Africa as it is progress towards address climate change crises and implementation of the blue economy by African countries.

Harsen Nyambe, Director of Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment at AU said Africa – European union partnerships is instrumental for addressing specific challenges, including the climate and biodiversity crises. AU is committed to continue working with the EU on blue economy.

He said the African Union recognizes the significance of the Africa – Europe strategy group on ocean governance. It has since created Centres of Excellence across the continent to contribute to evidence-based policy making, programming, and to improved ocean literacy.

Nassim Oulmane, Acting Director Technology, Climate Change and Natural Resource Management said Africa and the European Union share most of the coastline and partnership is key in addressing the climate change crisis, pollution.

The shared ocean seascapes between and around Africa and Europe he said provide a strong basis for the development of a coordinated strategy across the two continents.

“Both the AU and the EU have recognised that it is time to make progress on ocean cooperation while considering economic and social opportunities that fit with different levels of development across Africa and Europe,” said Mr. Oulmane

He said that there is need to scale up most of the initiatives on climate change for diversity of the oceans. ECA is working with IUCN on an initiative with the green wall, eastern part of the African Indian Ocean for creation of blue and involve the coastal population.

Pascal Lamy, Vice-President of the Paris Peace Forum, Chair of the EU Starfish Mission, said partnerships require time and resources. It is therefore important to monitor the progress and assess the efficacy of existing initiatives alongside the aspirations of the two continents to guarantee the desired outcome of the cross-continental partnership is met.

COP 28 has he said created an opportunity for countries to reflect and forge a head on their collaboration and partnership on ocean governance and blue economy and address the challenges of climate change. This requires political will and leadership on both the two continents – Africa and European continent.

“A shared vision on the ocean management and preservation is fundamental for exchanging best practices and learning on blue ocean economy through a reinforced multilateralism and capacity sharing,” said Mr. Lamy."

1145458383,20231210,"THE United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France and several other nations, along with the European Union, yesterday condemned China’s latest water cannon attack at Philippine vessels at the West Philippine Sea (WPS), saying the action undermines regional stability and the rule of law.

It was the second day in a row that Manila’s allies and partners hit China’s aggressive moves in the WPS, including blocking and turning its water cannons on Philippine Coast Guard vessels on a resupply mission to the same area yesterday.

Ayungin Shoal is in the Philippines’ 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and as upheld by the 2016 ruling of the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).

In Sunday’s incident, the embassies of Germany, Japan, Canada, Ireland, Finland, Australia, Korea and New Zealand either condemned or expressed concern over China’s move and called for respect and adherence to international law in resolving maritime territorial disputes.

US Ambassador MaryKay Carlson reiterated Washington’s support for Manila and called on Beijing to cease its aggressive and dangerous maneuvers.

“The United States stands with the Philippines and partners in vehemently condemning the People’s Republic of China’s repeated illegal and dangerous actions against Philippine vessels, including disrupting the Philippine resupply missions to the Sierra Madre today.

PRC aggression undermines regional stability in defiance of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Carlson said on X, formerly Twitter.

The US and the Philippines have the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) and Washington has repeatedly said an armed attack on Philippine ships, aircraft or troops in the South China Sea will automatically invoke the treaty.

European Union Ambassador Luc Veron said China should adhere to the arbitral award in resolving maritime disputes in the area.

“Another deeply troubling incident today, water cannons were used again. UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanisms maintain the rule of law, The 2016 UNCLOS Tribunal Award is a valuable framework for peaceful resolution,” Veron said.

Veron was referring to the 2016 PCA ruling which invalidated China’s massive claims in the South China Sea (SCS), to include the WPS, saying it has no historical nor legal basis.

Beijing has refused to honor the arbitral award and insisted on bilateral talks to resolve the dispute.

French Ambassador Marie Fontanel said her government is condemning China’s use of water cannons against Philippine vessels.

“UNCLOS was signed exactly 41 years ago December 10, 1982. Today more than ever, France recalls the value of international law to ensure freedom of navigation and is, once again, seriously concerned by the use of water cannons in the Philippine exclusive economic zone to prevent a resupply mission to BRP Sierra Madre,” Fontanel said.

Australian Ambassador Hae Kyong Yu said: “Australia remains steadfast in support of UNCLOS and international law. China’s further dangerous actions against Philippine vessels today, following yesterday’s incident, again risk lives and livelihoods and are deeply concerning.”

Japanese Ambassador to Manila Koshikawa Kazuhiko also joined in the condemnation of China’s aggressive moves.

“Gravely concerned about repeated dangerous actions by CCG vessels against PH vessels.

Japan stands with the Philippines in support of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific. Japan opposes actions that undermine the peace and stability in SCS,” the Japanese envoy said.

The embassy of New Zealand also expressed concern over “dangerous actions” against Philippine vessels in the area.

The New Zealand Embassy is deeply concerned at multiple incidents of dangerous actions towards the Philippines at Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal. This includes obstructing civilian boats and the use of water cannons against Philippine vessels, causing significant damage,” the embassy said.

The embassy of the Republic of Korea said it is “concerned about the recent use of water cannons against Philippine vessels in the South China Sea.”

“We reaffirm our strong support for peace, stability and rules-based order in the South China Sea and for the freedom of navigation and overflight based on the principles of international law, including UNCLOS,” it added.

Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said a legal case against China’s continued aggressive moves will include the incidents over the weekend.

Though he did not directly answer if the recent incidents will finally prod Malacañang to file a case against China before an international tribunal, Guevarra said the twin incidents on Saturday and Sunday will not escape the eyes of the country’s political leaders.

“I’m sure that China’s repeated provocative actions in the West Philippine Sea have not been lost in the consciousness of our political leaders. On the part of the Office of the Solicitor General, we are laying the groundwork for any legal action that may be taken in the future,” Guevarra said when sought for updates on the issue.

Guevarra said the recent incidents will serve to further bolster the country’s position against China in the legal arena.

“Definitely (we will include it as additional evidence against China). At some point, China will have to face the consequences of its wrongful acts before the international community, “Guevarra added.

“He has done nothing to address the continued attacks of his government on our troops and on our people,” Zubiri said in a statement.

“I strongly condemn the latest attack of Chinese ships on Philippine government vessels in the West Philippine Sea… This time, China not only caused damage to property but they also put Filipino lives at risk. This was a humanitarian mission and still China chose to attack them. They have no heart,” he added.

Zubiri said the Chinese “have gone from unlawfully blocking us from navigating our own waters” and are now deliberately damaging Philippine vessels which endanger people’s lives, all happening during this Christmas season.

Senate majority leader Joel Villanueva said the Philippines might be facing a “giant” in the WPS “but we must also be reminded that David had defeated Goliath.”

“Might does not give China the right to fire water cannons at our vessels, make dangerous maneuvers or block humanitarian missions. China has to adhere to international laws, such as the UNCLOS, and must stop encroaching into the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone,” Villanueva said in a statement.

Sen. Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada asked China to respect international laws, exercise restraint, and cases all actions “that jeopardize the peace and security of the region.”

“The Philippines has consistently advocated for peaceful and diplomatic solutions to disputes, and we call on all parties involved to engage in meaningful dialogue to address the root causes of these incidents. We must pursue avenues that promote cooperation, understanding, and respect for each other’s rights in the pursuit of a stable and secure region,” said Estrada, Committee on National Defense and Security, Peace, Unification, and Reconciliation chairman.

Estrada said the Chinese Coast Guard’s actions are illegal and show total disregard for human rights and Philippine sovereignty.

“We stand united in condemning these latest aggressive actions taken by CCG. We will not be cowed by any action to intimidate or undermine our sovereign rights,” he added.

Sen. Francis Tolentino said the latest Chinese bullying deserves to be condemned.

“We strongly condemn China’s use of water cannon against civilian research vessels near Bajo de Masinloc within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, undermining peace and stability in the region,” Tolentino said.

“We hope that the international community will remain united against harassment and that the festive spirit of generosity and goodwill will not be shadowed by the forces of intimidation. The Chinese Coast Guard should not spoil our Christmas with unwarranted aggression,” he added.

This latest Chinese aggression happened weeks after China joined 18 other Asia-Pacific countries in signing a joint communiqué which recognizes freedom of navigation under the UNCLOS, during the recently-concluded 31st Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum held in Manila from November 23 to 25.

Zubiri called the joint communiqué “historic” because China acknowledged the freedom of navigation in the seas under the UNCLOS as he hoped that Beijing would stop its coast guard and maritime militias from harassing Philippine vessels in the WPS.

It is “unacceptable and unjustifiable.”

“These actions by the (CCG), in preventing our vessels from conducting a peaceful resupply mission to Filipino fishermen near Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal), demonstrate a brazen disrespect for the rule of law and established international agreements,” he said in a statement.

The Speaker underscored the importance of reminding the international community that Scarborough Shoal lies within the Philippines’ 370-km exclusive economic zone, as established by the 2016 arbitral ruling, which China continues to ignore.

Romualdez said such acts of intimidation and harassment against Filipino fisherfolk “are not only a violation of their rights but also an affront to human dignity.”

“To prevent the distribution of humanitarian support is not only illegal but also inhumane,” he said.

Rep. France Castro reminded the Chinese Foreign Ministry that “no country in the world aside from China recognizes its right to the West Philippine Sea (WPS).”

“The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling on the South China Sea arbitration is the one recognized by the world. It is China’s claim that is ‘illegal, null and void,’” she said.

“China should wake up from its delusion and face reality. The Philippines has every right to protect its territorial integrity and ensure the welfare of its people. China has no right to dictate our actions within our own territory,” she also said. – With Raymond Africa and Wendell Vigilia"

1145464643,20231210,"It was reported on that the United States had imposed new sanctions on 21 individuals and entities believed to be involved in financing activities for Iranian military and paramilitary forces. The measures were revealed as tensions continue to rise throughout the surrounding region, and just one day after Tehran claimed to be on the cusp of a major upgrade to its military capabilities, care of its continually expanding relationships with the Russian Federation.

Officials from the Iranian Ministry of Defense told the state-affiliated Tasnim News Agency on that Tehran and Moscow had concluded a long-anticipated deal for the transfer of Russian jet fighters and helicopters to Iran. If implemented, such a deal would allow the Iranian air force to finally replace some of the aging, American-made aircraft that have comprised its entire arsenal since before the 1979 Islamic revolution.

Although the existing Iranian air force is considered the largest in the region, it is also understood to be at a serious disadvantage against more technologically advanced adversaries, particularly Israel. However, this has not stopped Iranian authorities from threatening its adversaries, especially after the October 7 attack that triggered the recent war in Gaza.

As is typical, those threats have largely relied upon reference to Iran’s other militant proxies in the region, rather than to its own military. State media has gone so far as to diagram what it might look like if all of those groups attacked Israel at once, from various sides. The establishment of a more modern Iranian air force might yet embolden Tehran to include its own military operations as part of that broader vision, especially if it signified that the Iranian regime’s posture in this conflict had the backing of a greater power.

So far, that has not been the case. Although Iranian-Russian relations have been developing for many years and have been accelerated by international sanctions imposed upon Iran over its nuclear activities and upon Russia over its ongoing war against Ukraine, the fact remains that Russia has traditionally had a cooperative relationship with Israel and is seemingly unwilling to involve itself in what many have described as a proxy war between the Israel and Iran’s regime.

The implicit threats from an upgraded Iranian air force are further diminished by the fact that Russia has provided no confirmation of a finalized deal, while this is not the first time that Iran has claimed a transfer is imminent. Earlier this year, Iranian state media broadcast images of fortified hangars which the military had reportedly set up to receive the Su-35 fighters it had been expecting. That expectation is grounded in Moscow’s perceived indebtedness to Tehran for the continuous supply of Iranian-made drones to be used as tools for keeping pressure on Ukraine, particularly through attacks on civilian infrastructure.

Most Western powers share the perception that Russia owes something to Iran, even if they question the latter’s claims about what form the repayment will take and how quickly it will arrive. In fact, it appears as if a greater concern for the United States and its allies is that the Islamic Republic might soon expand its support for the Russian war effort. On November 21, the White House revealed intelligence pointing to the potential Russian purchase of Iranian ballistic missiles. Moscow has tacitly encouraged that concern by stating that it has no intention of adhering to restrictions on the trade of such weapons with Iran, now that a relevant provision of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 has expired. The United States, Britain, and the European Union, on the other hand, continue to enforce the now-expired sanctions, in response to Iran’s preexisting arms sales and the acceleration of its nuclear activities.

In the wake of the American intelligence disclosure, independent security experts have noted that there is some uncertainty as to the timing and scale of forthcoming Russian purchases of Iranian missiles, and indeed whether they are forthcoming at all. No concrete statements on the matter have come from either side of the would-be transactions, but both appear to be making concerted efforts to stoke Western anxiety about military cooperation between the two rogue states.

On Tuesday, the Russian news agency TASS quoted Professor Hadi Goudarzi, counselor for science and education at the Iranian Embassy in Moscow, as saying that the two countries have made significant technical achievements together, but “the potential for cooperation between Iran and Russia is far from being exhausted.”

This was arguably in tension with remarks made by Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani in a press conference the previous day. Kanaani directly rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s call for fresh international sanctions to forestall the supply of ballistic missiles to Iran, then went on to argue that Iran’s cooperation with Russia “does not mean confrontation with Ukraine.”

The Foreign Ministry spokesman accused Western adversaries of using “media hype” in an effort to “influence Ukrainian officials’ positions and impact the two countries’ relations.” He also reiterated Tehran’s official denial of having provided any weapons to Russia since the start of war early last year, despite the fact that numerous independent analyses have confirmed the Iranian origin of drone components recovered from attack sites inside Ukraine.

Ukrainian media outlets and intelligence services have continually warned about both recent and forthcoming Iranian military transfers to Russia, making it somewhat ironic that Kanaani has now appealed directly to Ukrainian authorities to safeguard their own relationships with Iranian counterparts against supposed sabotage from the West."

1145482647,20221210,"The family of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year old woman whose September 2022 killing sparked countrywide protests in Iran, has been prohibited from traveling to France to collect a human rights award in her name.

According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), Amini's father, mother and brother were prevented from boarding a flight at Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport on Saturday. They were informed they were banned from traveling and their passports were then confiscated by security forces.

In an interview with London-based Iran International, Mahsa's father, Amjad Amini, said that the family was not given a reason for the travel ban.

""I said 'We have to know why, for what reason?' But no one gave us answer,"" Amini said.

He added he'd informed the authorities of the family's plan to travel a month in advance but was not made aware of a travel ban until they were at the airport.

The family's lawyer, Saleh Nikbakht, was allowed to travel to Strasbourg, France, to collect the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.

Mahsa Amini, who also went by her Kurdish name, Jina, died while in the custody of Iran's Morality Police. She was accused of violating Iran's strict dress code for women, also known as the hijab. Her death was a catalyst for protests that swept the country for months, and brought Iranians from across socio-economic and religious backgrounds to the streets.

The use of travel bans is common in Iran, Gissou Nia, an Iranian-American human rights lawyer and analyst at the Atlantic Council told NPR. It's often used to prevent activists from going overseas, where they might get more media attention for their cause.

""And there's a heightened sensitivity that her family's presence would shine a light on the situation in Iran,"" said Nia, adding Iranian authorities clearly wanted to avoid the optics of a bereaved family speaking on an international stage about how the brutality of Iran's Morality Police caused the death of their loved one.

""They know what happened with Mahsa Amini is problematic for them, and they really want people to think that it wasn't reflective of a systemic problem,"" Nia said.

""But this [travel ban] clearly shows that they know that this isn't the case — they don't want the family's voices to be heard.""

Amini's father, Amjad, was also detained on the anniversary of her death when a massive security presence prevented large protests and rallies.

""Woman, Life, Freedom,"" the slogan coined in protests after Amini's death, wasn't just a rallying cry against the enforcement of the hijab or for women's rights. It came to represent a demand for major reforms across Iran, which has been ruled by hardline clerics since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

Iranians face constant crackdowns on free speech, press freedom, LGBTQ rights, manners of dress, public displays of affection, dancing or performing music in public, and more.

Since those protests, according to HRANA, at least 19,000 have been arrested in the country. At least seven people have been executed for their ties to the protests, according to the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Several others, including rappers Toomaj Salehi and Saman Yasin, remain imprisoned and face the possibility of execution.

Despite the crackdowns, Mahsa Amini's name and the slogan born from her death remain synonymous with the human rights movement in Iran.

At Sunday's Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, in Oslo, Norway, the prize was awarded to another Iranian woman, human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, who remains imprisoned in Iran.

Mohammadi's daughter, Kiana Rahmani, started a speech at the ceremony honoring her mother's work with ""Zan, Zendegi, Azadi"" — Farsi for ""Woman, Life, Freedom."""

1145496202,20231211,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is pressuring European diplomats to cease any talks about Ukraine joining NATO, according to a member of Rada (the Ukrainian parliament), Oleksiy Goncharenko. This is no minor politician. The son of a former Odessa mayor, he is a member of the Ukrainian Permanent Delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). The allegations were publicly made in a series of texts posted in his Telegram channel (in Ukrainian). He wrote: “Unfortunately, there will be no NATO [for Ukraine]. Forget about it – it won’t happen.” Goncharenko claims that “several sources” in Washington told him the topic of Ukraine’s accession to the Atlantic Alliance “annoys the US elite” and even “after war” the country should not expect it.

The politician also commented on the ongoing friction between the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Valery Zaluzhny. According to Goncharenko, Washington is “not happy” about it. In addition, he says, one should expect the next aid package to Ukraine to be the last one: “In a year, at the end of 2024, we will not be given any more money… Most likely, we will switch to a credit form of cooperation. They’ll give a loan. Not a grant that won’t need to be repaid.”

Could such allegations be a fabrication created for propaganda purposes? There is no reason to think so and the logic of it in this case would be far from clear. In fact, Goncharenko’s claims make perfect sense in light of what we already know by now.

We know the US has been pressuring its ally to hold elections. Moreover, the US Mission to NATO last month posted on X (formerly Twitter) a vague message about Washington being “focused on setting the conditions for a just, durable, and sustainable peace” in Ukraine. We also know that European Union (EU) member states are divided over the bloc’s common budget, including additional funding for Kyiv in 2024.

In addition, Pulitzer winner journalist Seymour Hersh has written that, according to his American diplomacy and intelligence sources, the aforementioned General Valery Zaluzhny has been directly negotiating a peace deal with Russian general Valery Gerasimov, independently of Zelensky, who is described as a “wild card”. According to the journalist: “The two generals may continue to talk and Putin may indeed be interested in a settlement that gives him permanent control of Crimea and the four provinces he has claimed, but Zelensky remains the wild card. The American official said that Zelensky has been told that “this is a military-to-military problem to solve and the talks will go on with or without you.” If necessary, the American official told me, “We can finance his voyage to the Caribbean’.”

We know that the unprecedented sanctions against the Russian Federation have been backfiring since the beginning, with the Eurasian great power reaching record trade surplus as early as May 2022. That has sparked division within the European continent, and how de-industralized post-Nord Stream Europe has been hurt by the ongoing conflict and by American subsidy war.

As early as April 2023, as I wrote, former US ambassador to Finland, Earle Mack wrote that the US-led West had been “propping up Ukraine to fight a proxy war” but he could only see “a decade of death and chaos” for the country.

In May Zelensky was planning a number of bold actions against Russia, including bombing the Druzhba pipeline that provides Russian oil to Hungary (a NATO member), and even occupying Russian villages plus targeting the Russian Federation with long-range missiles. Such plans crossed some red lines and were a huge problem from the point of view of both the US and that of Ukraine’s neighbors.

That same month, aforementioned Serymour Hersh also reported that countries such as Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and the Czech Republic, led by Poland (with Germany playing some role in it too) had been pressuring the Ukrainian leader “to find a way to end the war, even by resigning himself if necessary, and to allow the process of rebuilding his nation to get under way.” According to Hersh’s CIA source at the time, these European leaders had “made it clear that ‘Zelensky can keep what he’s got – a villa in Italy and interests in offshore bank accounts – ‘if he works up a peace deal even if he’s got to be paid off, if it’s the only way to get a deal’.” Few months later, in September, Poland stopped sending Ukraine weapons, allegedly over a trade dispute, as bilateral relations deteriorated.

All of this points to a clear picture emerging, one that had been haunting Ukraine for a while: Western abandonment and betrayal – something of which Washington has a solid record. From an European perspective, the picture is even more dramatic: it is about the bloc’s own interests. As I wrote, in December 2021, American and European energy interests are far from converging and in fact the energy crisis in that part of the Old World is something that has benefited Washington, while hurting its European allies – and the same can be said about the American proxy attrition war in Eastern Europe. It is about time to admit NATO’s expansion has been a recipe for disaster and about time to admit Ukraine has a far-right problem and a problem with the way it deals with the Russian minority – and not just in Donbass. And all of that is a problem for Europe, too.

It remains to be seen how European leaders will conduct their policy pertaining to Ukraine and also to the strategic energy interests of the continent. One may expect many European voices urging the bloc to reconsider sanctions against Russia, for instance, as has been the case already. For a start, it could reconsider its stance on the issue of the rights of ethnic minorities.

1145502643,20231211,"MANILA (Dec 11): A Philippine boat and a Chinese Coast Guard ship collided near a hotly contested reef on Sunday, with both countries trading blame for the latest such confrontation in the disputed South China Sea.

The incident happened during a Philippine resupply mission to a tiny garrison on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, which is a flashpoint for Manila and Beijing.

It comes a day after the Philippines accused the Chinese coast guard of using water cannons to “obstruct” three government boats delivering provisions to Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal, off the main island of Luzon.

Longstanding tensions between Manila and Beijing over the sea have flared in recent months following multiple incidents involving Philippine and Chinese vessels, including two previous collisions.

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including waters and islands near the shores of its neighbours, and has ignored an international tribunal ruling that its assertions have no legal basis.

It deploys boats to patrol the busy waterway and has built artificial islands that it has militarised to reinforce its claims.

The Philippines said Sunday that “China Coast Guard and Chinese Maritime Militia vessels harassed, blocked and executed dangerous manoeuvres on Philippine civilian supply vessels”.

One of two boats carrying provisions was “rammed” by a Chinese coast guard ship, the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea said in a statement.

A Chinese ship also used water cannon against the two supply boats and a Philippine Coast Guard vessel escorting the mission, the multi-agency task force said.

That caused “severe damage” to the engine of one of the supply boats and damaged the mast of the coast guard vessel, it said.

The China Coast Guard, however, accused the Philippine boat of “deliberately colliding” with the Chinese vessel after “disregarding our multiple stern warnings”.

The Philippine boat “changed direction suddenly in an unprofessional, dangerous manner, deliberately colliding with our Coast Guard Vessel 21556, which was on a normal law enforcement route, and caused a scrape”, the China Coast Guard said in a statement.

It took “control measures” against the other Philippine supply boat, which was allegedly “carrying construction materials” to the grounded warship on which the garrison is located.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos issued a statement late Sunday saying that the country remained “undeterred” following the latest incidents.

“The aggression and provocations perpetrated by the China Coast Guard and their Chinese Maritime Militia against our vessels and personnel over the weekend have only further steeled our determination to defend and protect our nation’s sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea,” Marcos said in a statement on Facebook.

“No one but the Philippines has a legitimate right or legal basis to operate anywhere in the West Philippine Sea.”

Manila calls the South China Sea waters to the immediate west of the Philippines the West Philippine Sea.

Foreign diplomats in Manila were swift to criticise the Chinese actions.

US Ambassador MaryKay Carlson said the United States stood with “the Philippines and partners in vehemently condemning the PRC’s repeated illegal and dangerous actions against Philippine vessels”, using the acronym for China’s official name.

European Union Ambassador Luc Veron said Sunday’s incident was “deeply troubling”, while the New Zealand embassy said the country was “deeply concerned at multiple incidents of dangerous actions towards the Philippines”.

Hours after the latest incident, a convoy of civilian boats planning to deliver provisions to Filipino fishermen and troops in the South China Sea aborted the trip after “constant shadowing” by Chinese vessels, the organiser said.

The convoy, which departed the western island of Palawan early Sunday, had already changed course to avoid Second Thomas Shoal and go directly to Philippine-held Nanshan Island, where they would leave their cargo.

Second Thomas Shoal is about 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the western Philippine island of Palawan, and more than 1,000 kilometres from China’s nearest major landmass, Hainan island.

A handful of Filipino troops are stationed on the crumbling BRP Sierra Madre, which the Philippine Navy grounded on the reef in 1999 to check China’s advance in the waters.

The troops depend on the resupply missions for their survival.

One of the supply boats was able to deliver its cargo on Sunday, while the one involved in the collision was being towed by a Philippine Coast Guard vessel to Palawan, the task force said.

Relations between Manila and Beijing have deteriorated under President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to improve ties with traditional ally Washington and push back against Chinese actions in the South China Sea.

Marcos warned last month that the situation in the waters had become “more dire”. – AFP"
1145506778,20231211,"AT the COP28 Global Climate Action Summit, held on December 2nd, Papua New Guinea collaborated with the European Union and France to unveil a comprehensive country package designed for forests, nature and climate.

The goal was to halt deforestation by 2030 and to preserve the country’s natural resources for future generations.

The country package was a pioneering financing mechanism resulting from an international dialogue aimed at strengthening North-South solidarity.

It united donor countries, NGOs, philanthropists and multilateral development banks to ensure the sustainability of PNG’s conservation policies through the mobilisation of joint funding.

The initiative included a suite of programs, partnerships, and investments dedicated to the preservation of nature, forests, and the mitigation of climate impact.

At a special event, European Commission Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič, French Minister of State Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, and PNG Internal Security Minister Peter Tsiamalili endorsed a political declaration, officially launching the “country package.”

The initial funds for the package originated from the European Union, France, the Global Environment Facility of the World Bank, and the FAO/UICN seed fund.

The announced initial US$100 million (PGK 344 million) included the European Union-funded flagship Forestry, Climate Change, and Biodiversity (EU-FCCB) program in Papua New Guinea.

The country package had already garnered support from several partners, including Australia, the Global Environment Facility, the Asian Development Bank, and more.

However, there was still hope for more financial commitments from additional partners in the run-up to COP29, where the definitive Country Package was slated to be signed.

For the people of Papua New Guinea, the country package promised a better future where their natural resources could be preserved, and they could live in harmony with their environment.

It was a moment of hope and inspiration that would be forever remembered in the country’s history."

1145516660,20231211,"Like a bolt from the blue, OPEC’s letter to COP28 has sparked a real uproar. Not only the activists rose up, but also the European Union itself, together with the Spanish and French governments, rejected without appeal the harsh position of the Vienna cartel. The spark was triggered by the Secretary General of OPECHaitham Al Ghais, which sent a letter to the 13 members of the group and 10 allies led by Russia, after the negotiators, during the Dubai talks, released a draft agreement that included the request to phase out fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas), main causes of global warming. In the text of the letter, the Vienna organization warned member countries with “maximum urgency” that “the pressure against fossil fuels could reach a turning point with irreversible consequences”. And so given that a “phasing out of fossil fuels” remains on the negotiating table at the United Nations climate summit, OPEC has urged oil states to “proactively reject any text or formula that targets energy, i.e. fossil fuels, rather than emissions.” In short, OPEC fears that COP28 could represent a turning point against oil and gas, which they say “put the prosperity and future of our people at risk”. 

OPEC, founded in 1960 by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iraq, Iran and Kuwait, has over the years seen the membership of Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Nigeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and the Republic of Congo: As of 2019, there are thus 14 member states, which possess 80% of global oil reserves and which have produced approximately 40% of the world’s oil in the last decade.

The Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera, called the OPEC letter “repugnant”. The French Energy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher she said she was “astonished” while the European Union made it known that it will fight until the last moment so that the climate summit in Dubai ends with a clear agreement on the beginning of the elimination of fossil fuels because, according to its representatives , science says that “there is no alternative” to tackle climate warming. The representative of the presidency, the minister of ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, says she is convinced that «it is worth fighting and making it clear that it is very difficult to create the conditions for this massive investment and at the pace we need if we continue to speak vaguely ».

The letter was also sent to the United Arab Emirates, another OPEC member, which hosts COP28. More than 100 countries want COP28’s final decision to call for the phase-out of fossil fuels. This would be a strong signal that the end of the age of coal, oil and gas has arrived and would help drive the necessary and urgent cuts that scientists have made clear are necessary. Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are the main cause of the climate crisis. Emissions are still rising, but they need to fall by almost half by 2030 and reach zero by 2050 to have a chance of keeping global warming within the internationally agreed 1.5 degree limit."

1145531565,20231211,"The European Union (EU) on Saturday reached provisional agreement on the AI Act – a broad legal framework limiting how artificial intelligence can be used.

""The EU's AI Act is the first-ever comprehensive legal framework on Artificial Intelligence worldwide,"" claimed EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.

According to von der Leyen, the agreement focuses on identifiable risks, thereby creating legal certainty for the industry and the technology's development.

The Commission's description of the Act outlines a tiered risk management system, with different AIs categorized by their impact on rights.

The majority of AI systems fit within the ""minimal risk"" category, the classification used for auto recommendation systems, spam filters and the like. Participation in AI codes of conduct for providers of such services will be voluntary.

AI systems deemed ""high-risk"" – such as those related to critical infrastructures, education access assessment, law enforcement, or biometric identification – will be subjected to stricter requirements.

Anything presenting a clear threat to fundamental rights falls in the ""unacceptable risk"" tier and is not permitted.

AIs in this category include predictive policing, workplace emotional recognition systems, manipulation of human behavior to circumvent free will, or categorizing people based on qualities including political or religious persuasion, race, or sexual orientation.

The Act will also require labelling of deepfakes and AI generated content, while chatbot users must be made aware they are conversing with a machine.

Meanwhile, foundational models used in AI that require training upwards of 1025 flops will face additional regulation in 12 months' time.
• Mere minority of orgs put GenAI in production after year of hype
• Dell CTO says enterprises will have GenAI in production next year – what could go wrong?
• EU running in circles trying to get AI Act out the door

With a six-month lead time to compliance, AI developers will need to ensure any feature that falls within the unacceptable risk category is quickly removed from their products. Compliance with regs for ""high risk"" AI must also be in place within half a year of the Act's passage.

Being found afoul of the Act brings substantial fines that AI law expert Barry Scannell evaluated as ""a significant financial risk"" for businesses.

These fines are anywhere from 1.5 percent of their global turnover or $8 million, to seven percent or $37.7 million – depending on the violation and the developer's capacity.

The Commission did hint it could explore ""more proportionate caps"" on fines for startups and SMEs.

According to Scanell, there's a lot for businesses to consider. Those that invest in biometric and emotion recognition may need ""major strategic shifts.""

""Additionally, enhanced transparency requirements might challenge the protection of intellectual property, necessitating a balance between disclosure and maintaining trade secrets,"" wrote the Dublin-based attorney.

He also assessed that upgrading data quality and acquiring advanced bias management tools could raise operational costs. The increased documentation and human oversight could also present a business nuisance in the form of time and money.

The agreement was signed after 38 hours of negotiation. European Parliament member Svenja Hahn praised the result as preventing massive overregulation, but expressed concerned it could use ""more openness to innovation and an even stronger commitment to civil rights.""

The lawmaker was disappointed by the failure to prevent allowance of real-time biometric identification ""against the massive headwind from the member states,"" but expressed she was pleased by the prevention of biometric mass surveillance.

Big Tech was also not entirely satisfied with the Act. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) quipped that ""the outcome seems to indicate that future-proof AI legislation was sacrificed for a quick deal"" and ""is likely to slow down innovation in Europe.""

CCIA members represent a who's who of internet services, software and telecom companies – including names like Amazon, Apple, Cloudflare, Intel, Google, Samsung, and Red Hat.

The CCIA complained in its canned statement about the increased requirements for some technologies and the full on bans for those deemed an ""unacceptable risk.""

""This could lead to an exodus of European AI companies and talent seeking growth elsewhere,"" asserted the CCIA.

While the agreement is fairly set, it's not an absolutely done deal. It still must pass formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council. It will enter into force 20 days after publication in the Official Journal.

Von der Leyen promised to continue the work of AI regulation at an international level – through involvement in the G7, OECD, Council of Europe, G20 and UN. ®"

1145537640,20231211,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The head of the Philippine military said Monday he was with his forces aboard a supply boat when it was , surrounded and shoved by Chinese coast guard ships over the weekend in the .

China, meanwhile, accused archrival the United States of encouraging the Philippines, its treaty ally, to provoke China for its own purposes, though it provided no direct evidence.

The successive days of heated confrontations underscore China’s determination to assert its , despite the possibility of fomenting a larger conflict affecting shipping and other maritime activities in the crucial waterway.

Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that China was escalating its aggression in the contested waters but said it would not deter Filipino forces from defending their territorial interests.

More than 100 official Chinese and other government-linked ships have swarmed the high seas around the contested Second Thomas Shoal, where a marooned Philippine navy ship that Brawner visited has stood for decades. He said their presence was much bigger than in previous months.

“It’s pure aggression,” Brawner said. “I witnessed how many times the big Chinese coast guard and militia ships cut our path. They water-cannoned us, then bumped us. It’s angering.”

“This really needs a diplomatic solution at the higher level,” he said, but added that the armed forces would continue to support front-line troops and protect fishermen.

Brawner, the U.S.-educated chief of the 150,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines, joined navy personnel in a wooden-hulled supply boat, the Unnaiza Mae 1, which brought Christmas gifts, food and other supplies to a small contingent of Filipino marines and navy personnel stationed aboard the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal.

Although now crumbling with rust and holes, the slightly listing Sierra Madre remains an actively commissioned Philippine navy ship, meaning any assault on it would be considered an act of war. It has become a fragile symbol of the territorial claims of the Philippines.

Brawner said he conveyed President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s Christmas greetings to the Filipino forces and shared with them a traditional rice lunch.

it is obligated to defend the Philippines, , if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea. China has warned the U.S. not to meddle in what it says is a purely Asian dispute.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reinforced that message at a daily briefing Monday, saying the maritime disputes were “issues between the two countries, and no third party has the right to intervene.”

“Recently, the U.S., in order to realize its own geopolitical interests, has encouraged, supported, and cooperated with the Philippines in its violations and provocations in the South China Sea, exaggerating differences and inciting confrontation,” Mao told reporters.

Over the weekend, Philippine officials said the Chinese coast guard and suspected militia ships targeted Philippine vessels two days in a row with water cannon blasts and rammed one of them, causing damage and endangering crew, off Second Thomas Shoal and separately in Scarborough Shoal off the northwestern Philippines.

More than a dozen countries, including the U.S., Japan, the European Union, Germany, France, Canada and Australia, expressed support for the Philippines and concern over the incidents, Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Teresita Daza said.

Philippine officials said the Chinese coast guard’s high-pressure water cannon blasts disabled and damaged the engines of the Philippine supply boat M/L Kalayaan, which had to be towed back to a Philippine port. One of two Philippine coast guard escort ships, the BRP Cabra, sustained damage to its mast.

The Chinese coast guard said it had “implemented controls in accordance with laws and regulations.” The statement gave no details about the measures taken but said the Philippines action “seriously infringed on China’s sovereignty.”

“The responsibility lies entirely with the Philippine side,” the Chinese coast guard said.

The U.S. State Department said the actions by China’s ship “were dangerous and unlawful” and undermined regional stability. It renewed a vow that it would defend Philippine forces if they face an armed attack.

China has rejected all international condemnation and attempts at legal intervention, including , leaving them without any legal basis. China says it has a legal right to “defend its sovereignty” in keeping with its expansive claim to the South China Sea.

On Saturday, the Chinese coast guard and accompanying ships also trained water cannons at three Philippine fisheries vessels, causing damage to one, to prevent them from approaching Scarborough Shoal. Officials said that Chinese vessels used a long-range acoustic device that could impair hearing, causing “severe temporary discomfort and incapacitation to some Filipino crew.”

In other high seas clashes this year, Philippines officials said that that caused Filipino crew members temporary blindness and engaged in dangerous blocking and shadowing maneuvers that caused minor collisions.

1145567326,20231211,"Three governing bodies of the European Union have been intensely negotiating the final version of the EU AI Act, a major package of laws regulating the industry that was first proposed back in 2021. The initial deadline for a final package, December 6, has now come and gone, though lawmakers have not given up and were debating into the early hours of Thursday morning and again on Friday.

Just a few months ago, it seemed as though the EU AI Act was on its way to getting all the necessary votes and setting the benchmark for AI regulation far beyond the European bloc. But now France, Germany, and Italy in the EU Council, which is composed of member countries’ heads of state, have contested some of the package’s main tenets, and the legislation seems in real danger of failing—which would open the door for other countries outside Europe to set the global AI agenda.

To better understand the key sticking points and what’s next, I spoke with our senior AI reporter Melissa Heikkilä and Connor Dunlop, a policy expert at the Ada Lovelace Institute. I’ll warn it’s all pretty complex and it’s still a moving target; as Connor tells me, “The most surprising thing has been the level of drafting and redrafting across all three EU institutions,” which he describes as “unprecedented.” But here, with their help, I’ll do my best to answer some of the biggest questions.

What is the basic outline of this law?

As a refresher, the EU AI Act seeks to establish a risk-based framework for regulating artificial-intelligence products and applications. The use of AI in hiring, for example, is more tightly regulated and requires more transparency than a “lower-risk” application, like AI-enabled spam filters. (I wrote about the package back in June, if you want more background information.)

Why has this been so hard to finalize?

First, Melissa tells me, there is a lot of disagreement about foundation models, which has taken up most of the energy and space during the latest debates. There are several definitions of the term “foundation model” floating around, which is part of what’s causing the discord, but the core concept has to do with general-purpose AI that can do many different things for various applications.

You’ve probably played around with ChatGPT; that interface is essentially powered by a foundation model, in this case a large language model from OpenAI. Making this more complex, though, is that these technologies can also be plugged into various other applications with more narrow uses, like education or advertising.

Initial versions of the EU AI Act didn’t explicitly consider foundation models, but Melissa notes that the proliferation of generative AI products over the past year pushed lawmakers to integrate them into the risk framework. In the version of the legislation passed by Parliament in June, all foundation models would be tightly regulated regardless of their assigned risk category or how they are used. This was deemed necessary in light of the vast amount of training data required to build them, as well as IP and privacy concerns and the overall impact they have on other technologies.

But of course, tech companies that build foundation models have disputed this and advocate for a more nuanced approach that considers how the models are used. France, Germany, and Italy have flipped their positions and gone so far to say that foundation models should be largely exempt from AI Act regulations. (I’ll get at why below.)"

More than 100 Chinese government and suspected militia vessels have swarmed the high seas around the disputed Second Thomas Bank, where a long-abandoned Philippine Navy ship that Brawner visited has been located for decades. He said the swarm of Chinese ships was much larger than in previous months.

“This is pure aggression,” Brawner said of China’s maneuvers on the high seas. “I have witnessed how many times large Chinese coast guard and militia ships have cut us off. They threw water cannons at us, then hit us. It’s infuriating.

“This really requires a diplomatic solution at a higher level,” he said, but added that “the Philippine Armed Forces will continue our mission because it is legal and it is our obligation to supply our troops on the front lines, and that is our obligation. to protect our fishermen.

Brawner, the U.S.-trained leader of the Philippines’ 150,000-member armed forces, joined navy personnel aboard a wooden-hulled supply boat, the Unnaiza Mae 1, which brought gifts of Christmas, food and other supplies to a small contingent of Filipino marines. and naval personnel stationed aboard the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal.

Although now collapsed due to rust and holes, the slightly listed BRP Sierra Madre remains an actively commissioned Philippine Navy ship, meaning any attack on it would be considered an act of war. It has become a fragile symbol of the Philippines’ territorial claims to this strategic waterway, which China claims virtually in its entirety.

After the Philippines deliberately beached the Sierra Madre in the shallows of Scarborough Reef in 1999, China surrounded the atoll with its coast guard, navy and suspected militia ships to isolate Philippine forces that were there. The years-long territorial standoff has steadily escalated and become one of the most delicate flashpoints in the South China Sea and a delicate fault line in the regional rivalry between the United States and China.

The United States has repeatedly warned that it is required to defend the Philippines, its oldest ally in Asia, if Philippine forces, ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the China Sea southern. China has warned the United States not to interfere in what it sees as a purely Asian dispute.

Brawner said he conveyed Christmas greetings from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to the Philippine forces aboard the BRP Sierra Madre, where he shared with them a traditional hand-eaten rice lunch.

Manila’s foreign ministry said it had summoned China’s ambassador on Monday and filed diplomatic protests against Beijing.

A Philippine Coast Guard spokesman, Commodore Jay Tarriela, called the Chinese coast guard’s actions “barbaric” during a press conference and said the Philippine Coast Guard would not use its guns water against Chinese ships.

Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri called on Marcos to order the expulsion of the Chinese ambassador, but the Marcos administration has not indicated how it will respond to the call.

On Sunday, Marcos said that “the assaults and provocations perpetrated by the Chinese Coast Guard and its Chinese maritime militia against our ships and personnel over the weekend have only further strengthened our resolve to defend and protect sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction of our nation” the South China Sea.

Over the weekend, Philippine officials said Chinese coast guard and suspected militia ships targeted Philippine ships two days in a row with water cannon blasts and rammed one of them. them, causing damage and endangering Filipino crew members off the Second Thomas Shoal and separately in the Scarborough. Shoal off the northwest Philippines.

The Philippines, along with the United States and Japan, condemned the maneuvers of the Chinese coast guard and the ships accompanying them. More than a dozen countries, including the European Union, Germany, France, Canada and Australia, also expressed support for the Philippines and expressed concern over the incident, the spokesperson said. word from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Teresita Daza.

Philippine officials said firing from the Chinese coast guard’s high-pressure water cannons disabled and damaged the engines of the Philippine supply boat M/L Kalayaan, which had to be towed to a Philippine port.

One of the two Philippine Coast Guard escort vessels, the BRP Cabra, suffered mast damage due to the water cannon explosion.

China’s coast guard said it had “implemented controls in accordance with laws and regulations.” The statement gave no details of the measures taken, but said the Philippines’ action “severely undermines China’s sovereignty.”

It also said a Philippine vessel ignored warnings and, in violation of international navigation regulations, made a sharp turn in an “unprofessional and unsafe manner” and intentionally collided with a Chinese coast guard vessel , causing “scratches”.

“The responsibility lies entirely with the Philippine side,” the Chinese coast guard said.

The US State Department said the Chinese ship’s actions “were dangerous and illegal” and undermined regional stability. He renewed his commitment to defend Philippine forces if they faced armed attack.

China has rejected all international condemnations and attempts at legal intervention, including a 2016 ruling by a U.N.-backed arbitration tribunal that invalidated China’s claims, leaving them without any legal basis. China says it has the legal right to “defend its sovereignty” in line with its broad claim to the South China Sea.

On Saturday, the Chinese coast guard and accompanying ships also aimed water cannons at three Philippine fishing vessels, causing damage to one of them, in an attempt to prevent them from approaching the reef of Scarborough, in disputed waters off the northwest Philippines, Philippine officials said.

They added that suspected Chinese militia vessels used a long-range acoustic device that could impair hearing, causing “severe temporary discomfort and incapacitation to some Filipino crew members.”

In other clashes on the high seas this year, Philippine officials said Chinese coast guard vessels used a military-grade laser that temporarily blinded Filipino crew members and engaged in dangerous blocking and observation maneuvers which caused minor collisions.

""The situation in the West Bank is worrying us, in particular because of the too numerous cases of violence committed by extremist settlers"", Colonna said.

France in recent weeks opened the door for talks among European Union members on potential EU sanctions against Israeli settlers who have targeted Palestinians in the West Bank, but the matter so far hasn't been met with consensus.

Israel continued its brutal bombardment of southern Gaza's main city on Monday after Palestinian resistance group Hamas warned no Israeli captives would leave the territory alive unless its demands for prisoner releases were met.

Israel's barbaric offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed at least 18,000 people, mostly women and children.

The Palestinian health ministry said on Monday that dozens of people had been killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip, while Israel's army reported rocket fire from Gaza into Israel.

Only 14 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are functioning at any capacity, according to the United Nations' humanitarian agency OCHA.

""Gaza's health system is on its knees and collapsing,"" said World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, as the agency called for immediate, unimpeded aid deliveries.

On the other hand, Israel says there are still 137 captives in Gaza, while activists say around 7,000 Palestinians are in Israeli jails.

Months of intense bombardment and clashes have left Gaza's health system on the brink of collapse, with most hospitals no longer functioning and nearly two million people displaced."
1145592070,20231211,"Iraqi operator Fly Baghdad has been banned from operating within European Union airspace over a series of safety concerns, particularly regarding crew fatigue management.

Fly Baghdad operates around a dozen aircraft – primarily Boeing 737 variants including -800s and -900ERs – on services within the Middle East, eastern Mediterranean, and the Indian subcontinent.

It had attempted to secure third-country operator’s authorisation from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in February last year, a requirement for serving EU destinations.

But EASA, while examining the airline’s operation, determined that it did not ensure that flight times, crew duty periods and crew rest periods were within limitations established by Iraqi regulations.

The European Commission, which has newly included Fly Baghdad to its airline blacklist, says the carrier’s “inability to address these safety concerns” was demonstrated by its submission of an “unacceptable corrective action plan” to deal with the identified problems.

“Fly Baghdad did not demonstrate compliance with applicable international safety standards,” it adds.

Although Fly Baghdad appealed this refusal, EASA upheld the rejection in September 2023, ruling that the appeal was “unfounded”, the Commission states.

Following the initial EASA refusal, EU air safety committee representatives informed the Iraqi civil aviation authority that it would review the operational situation of Fly Baghdad.

Both the Iraqi regulator and the airline participated in an air safety committee hearing in mid-November.

Fly Baghdad presented information on root-cause analysis and actions taken on organisation, procedures, training and compliance, but ultimately failed to satisfy the committee.

“While expressing Fly Baghdad’s commitment to continuous safety improvement, the presentation addressing the individual safety concerns did not provide sufficient evidence of the detailed functioning of Fly Baghdad’s safety and quality management system,” says the Commission.

It adds that the information provided did not fully address the concerns which led to EASA’s refusal of third-country authorisation, and the corrective action plan – and the root-cause analysis – “did not demonstrate the air carrier’s ability to implement appropriate measures” to assure safety compliance.

Fly Baghdad, as a result, is one of six airlines – and the second from Iraq – to be banned from the EU on an individual basis.

Flag-carrier Iraqi Airways was banned in December 2015 and remains blacklisted despite years of negotiations to lift the restriction. In order to offer EU destinations both Iraqi Airways and Fly Baghdad need to enlist approved wet-lease carriers to serve routes on their behalf.

The banning of a second Iraqi airline has placed the Iraqi civil aviation authority – which oversees the holders of seven air operator’s certificates – under increased pressure.

Its representatives detailed efforts to conduct audits and strengthen its oversight capabilities to the mid-November committee meeting, including plans to source specialist knowledge in such areas as flight operations, airworthiness, and licensing.

But the Commission says it intends to carry out – with EASA support – an on-site verification visit to Iraq, to include a number of Iraqi airlines, to assess whether certification and oversight of the country’s carriers meet international standards."

How to prevent the deadliest gynecological cancer In 2018, we found out that my mom, Teresa, had stage 4 ovarian cancer. While the odds were stacked against her, she somehow survived after a brutal six months of chemotherapy. When the cancer came back 11 months later, she tested positive for a gene mutation, which contributed to the development of her cancer. She urged her three kids to get tested to see if we have it too. My results revealed that I do.

I’ll shortly have surgery for prophylactic removal of my ovaries and my fallopian tubes, as a way to make sure I don’t go through what my mom has gone through: four rounds with this cancer in the last five years.



In some ways, things are looking up. But there’s no getting away from those grim statistics—most women who get ovarian cancer die from it. So while removing my organs is not an ideal plan of action, it’s the only one we’ve got so far.

The construction of the 109-kilometer natural gas pipeline from Nis to Dimitrovgrad took 12 months. The cost of building the interconnector was EUR85.5 million. The European Union gave EUR49.6 million in grants for the project, Serbia provided EUR15 million and another EUR7.5 million for the preparations and design, while EUR25 million came from the European Investment Bank in the form of a loan to Serbia.

The Bulgarian president said the launch of the interconnector would change the energy landscape of Europe, and that the interconnector was a symbol of rising technological capacities and the successful and fruitful cooperation between Serbia, Bulgaria and Azerbaijan. Giaufret said the interconnector linked Serbia and the EU and reduced the use of coal, and thereby pollution. This interconnector is part of overall EU support to Serbia's energy sector and ending its dependence on Russian gas, he stressed.

Aliyev said the Bulgaria-Serbia gas interconnector would contribute to the energy security of the two countries, but Europe, too. Vucic said Serbia had done more to build its gas pipeline network over the last three years than in the past 70, announcing the construction of pipelines to Vranje, via Mt Zlatibor and Nova Varos, Prijepolje and Priboj."

1145657601,20231211,"South Africa’s PetroSA aims to make a final investment decision (FID) by April on a project designed to support the resumption of production at the mothballed gas-to-liquids (GTL) refinery in Mossel Bay, following receipt of Cabinet’s backing for its controversial selection of Russia’s GazpromBank Africa as the project’s investment partner.

The endorsement was made at a special meeting held on December 8, where Cabinet received an update on progress regarding the reinstatement of the GTL refinery, which has been in care and maintenance since November 2020, following the failure of the $1-billion Project Ikhwezi to replenish the refinery’s dwindling supply of indigenous offshore gas.

Cabinet was also updated on the process followed by the Central Energy Fund, PetroSA’s State-owned holding company, to secure a partner with the “requisite technical and financial resources” to return the refinery to full operation on a risk-sharing basis.

The selection of GazpromBank Africa arose after PetroSA issued a request for proposals in January from potential partners that could offer a turnkey solution, including funding and feedstock security, to refurbish, modify and upgrade the decommissioned facility.

In late November, investigative publication amaBhungane revealed that, while 20 companies submitted bids, the evaluation criteria employed by PetroSA resulted in all but GazpromBank Africa being disqualified. This, despite concerns raised internally about the threat of sanctions, given that the US and the European Union had imposed sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.

Cabinet spokesperson Khumbudzo Ntshavheni dismissed arguments that the partnership could posed a secondary sanctions risk, noting various exemptions in place, while highlighting that several other countries, including Brics bloc countries, had ongoing energy trade activities with Russian companies.

In a separate briefing, PetroSA acting COO Sesakho Magadla reported that an independent legal opinion had been obtained, which concluded the sanctions risk to be low, owing to the fact that primary sanctions affected companies and individuals from those countries that had imposed the restrictions, while no secondary sanctions had, to date, been imposed on other countries.

Magadla also suggested that “critical energy security”, along with food and medicines, had been exempted from the sanctions.

“This project falls within that description, because it is also critical for South Africa’s energy security,” she asserted.

The tie-up with a Russian company could, however, have implications for PetroSA’s plans to cooperate with TotalEnergies, of France, on the international energy group’s Brulpadda and Luiperd fields, offshore the South African coast.

However, PetroSA indicated that progress had slowed primarily because of pricing issues, with first gas only expected after 2030.

“We cannot be sitting idle and waiting for 2030 while our plant is rotting,” Magadla added.

Ntshavheni noted that the partnership with GazpromBank Africa remained dependent on the FID decision, which would itself be informed by the outcome of a joint bankable business case.

PetroSA is optimistic of reaching FID with GazpromBank Africa on what has been reported to be a R3.7-billion project during the first quarter of the 2024 calendar year.

The company expects to achieve financial close by the end of the second quarter, after which it expects engineering and construction to be implemented over an 18-month period.

PetroSA acting CEO Sandisiwe Ncemane argued that the reinstatement of the project would support security of fuel supply in the Eastern, Northern and Western Cape provinces in a context of declining domestic refining capacity.

The company also argued that reinstating the GTL refinery as soon as possible would help prevent the asset, which it values at $2.85-billion, from further decay.

However, it acknowledged that significant investment would be required to restart production, owing to the fact that some equipment was either obsolete or in poor condition."

1145690006,20231211,"Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. was traveling with a military resupply convoy when the incident occurred.

Journalists watch a video presentation during a news conference in Manila of Philippine Coast Guard personnel assisting a supply boat after it was allegedly damaged by a China Coast Guard water cannon in the South China Sea, Dec. 11, 2023.

The chief of the Philippine armed forces was aboard a small wooden-hulled boat when, he said, a Chinese ship hit it during a series of weekend incidents that Manila was calling a “serious escalation” of tensions in disputed waters.

Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said he was on the Unaizah Mae 1, one of three Philippine boats allegedly blasted by Chinese water cannon and piercing sounds during a resupply mission to the BRP Sierra Madre, a Philippine military outpost at Second Thomas (Ayungin) Shoal in the South China Sea.

“It was rammed. The Chinese coast guard were shadowing us from the start, and they got as close as 500 meters, 200 meters, then 100 meters,” Brawner told DZBB, a Tagalog-language radio station, on Monday.

“When dawn broke, we clearly saw that the Chinese militia [ship] tried to cut our path. Their maneuver was very dangerous.”

Also on Monday, Philippine officials presented images and videos of the incident.

“This is a serious escalation on the part of the agents of the People’s Republic of China,” Jonathan Malaya, spokesman for the National Security Council spokesman, said during a news conference.

In Beijing, meanwhile, a spokeswoman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters that a Philippine boat had traveled “headlong” into a Chinese ship.

Brawner said he slept aboard the Unaizah Mae 1 and oversaw “legitimate radio challenges” to Chinese boats in the area, adding that two China Coast Guard ships and three Chinese maritime militia ships were following the small Philippine boat. About 40 Chinese ships in all were stationed in the waters in and around Ayungin Shoal, he said.

“They started shadowing us on Saturday and it continued at 4 a.m. the following day, and until we – the Unaizah Mae – reached BRP Sierra Madre at 8 a.m.,” he said.

Brawner said he was “very angry” about the harassment of the resupply mission.

“The Chinese were not told that I was aboard Unaizah Mae 1, so maybe that’s why it happened and they did not change tactics,” Brawner said during the radio interview.

“While their aggressive actions have increased, our directive to our troops is to practice maximum tolerance. That’s why we were just trying to evade them.”

The latest incident forced government officials to order a civilian “Christmas convoy” that had been set up to deliver holiday supplies to troops and fishermen in disputed waters to return to shore, according to ATIN ITO, the group organizing the effort.

The BRP Sierra Madre is a rusted World War II-era navy ship that Manila grounded deliberately to mark its territorial claim at Ayungin Shoal, a reef in the contested Spratly Islands that lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.

Manila also accused the Chinese coast guard of firing water cannon and painful sound blasts against boats that were ferrying supplies to Filipino fishermen near Scarborough Shoal, another disputed area, over the weekend.

On Monday, Manila’s foreign affairs department said it had filed a formal protest to Beijing and summoned China’s envoy, while the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, announced that Beijing had lodged its own protest over the incident.

“[A] Philippine vessel went headlong towards Ren’ai Jiao’s lagoon and dangerously rammed a CCG ship on the scene,” Mao Ning said, using an acronym for the China Coast Guard. “This gravely violated China’s sovereignty and jeopardized the safety of the Chinese ships and personnel.”

Ren’ai Jiao is the Chinese name for Second Thomas Shoal.

“The root cause is that the Philippines has broken its promise and refused to tow away the illegally grounded warship at the reef and attempted to reinforce it on a large scale in an attempt to permanently occupy Ren’ai Jiao,” she said.

In response to the tensions in the waterway over the weekend, the United States, the European Union and Japan all issued statements condemning what they described as “dangerous actions” by the Chinese ships.

When a reporter asked her about a U.S. statement calling on China to stop “dangerous and destabilizing” actions in the South China Sea, Mao Ning said her nation would take the necessary steps to ensure territorial sovereignty.

“[T]he U.S. has been fanning disputes, misrepresenting facts, stoking confrontation and undermining regional peace and stability,” she said during the foreign ministry’s daily news briefing in Beijing.

1145724564,20231212,"The United Nations General Assembly is expected to call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to the Gaza war as Israel plans to speed up the entry of aid into the enclave by allowing trucks to be inspected at the Nitzana and Kerem Shalom Crossing.

“Trucks containing water, food, medical supplies, and shelter equipment will be screened at the Nitzana Crossing and the Kerem Shalom Crossing - and will be forwarded from there to international aid organizations in the Gaza Strip via the Rafah Crossing in Egypt,” the Office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said on Monday.

Israel closed Kerem Shalom which is the main commercial crossing into Gaza at the start of the war two months ago. Since then only humanitarian aid has entered the enclave, traveling there through Egypt’s Rafah crossing which is not equipped to handle the needed volume of goods.

“We would like to emphasize that no supplies will be entering the Gaza Strip from Israel and that all the humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip will continue to enter via the Rafah crossing in Egypt,” COGAT stated.

Despite intense international pressure, Israel moved forward with its military campaign to oust Hamas from Gaza following the October 7 attack, in which the terror group killed over 1,200 people and seized some 250 hostages.

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters in Brussels that “the destruction of buildings in Gaza was more or less or even greater than the destruction suffered by German citizens during the Second World War” as he called for a ceasefire.

United States National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters aboard Air Force One that the Biden administration opposed a ceasefire that would only benefit Hamas.

But, he said, the US supports additional humanitarian pauses such as the seven-day one Qatar had secured last week in which 105 hostages were freed. The US continues to work for another pause that would allow for more hostages to be freed, Kirby said.

There are “daily conversations” to advance such a pause, he said, amid reports that such a deal could come to fruition next week.

“We want to get those hostages out, we are still working with the Israelis to get humanitarian assistance in,” he said.

The US is also worried about the regional spillover from the Gaza war, Kirby said, as violence continued along Israel’s northern border. “We absolutely do not want to see this conflict spill over into Lebanon. We do not want to see a second front. We do not want to see it escalate and widen,” Kirby said.

In addition, Kirby said, the United States is concerned about reports Israel used US-supplied white phosphorus munitions in an October attack in southern Lebanon.

""We've seen the reports. Certainly concerned about that. We'll be asking questions to try to learn a little bit more.”

Kirby said white phosphorus has a ""legitimate military utility"" for illumination and producing smoke to conceal movements.

""Obviously any time that we provide items like white phosphorous to another military, it is with the full expectation that it will be used in keeping with those legitimate purposes ... and in keeping with the law of armed conflict,"" he said.

In Tel Aviv Defense Minister Yoav Gallant responded to a question about white phosphorus in Lebanon, said: ""The IDF and the entire security establishment acts according to international law. That is how we have acted and how we will act.”

He also clarified that Israel had no intention of remaining in Gaza once the war was over, although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that it must remain under Israeli security control.

In a closed-door meeting, Netanyahu told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that a civilian administration will operate in Gaza and the Gulf states, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, will rehabilitate the enclave, according to a report on KAN News.

He pushed back at the Biden administration’s plan to place the Palestinian Authority in Gaza after the war.

""The difference between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority is that Hamas wants to destroy us here and now, and the PA wants to do it in stages,” he said.

In Washington State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller expressed concern about the videos which have been circulated about Hamas terrorists stripped to their underwear and shorts when arrested by the IDF. He also spoke about the importance of Israel complying with humanitarian law, particularly since it receives military assistance from the US.

Miller also told reporters on Monday that US Special Envoy David Satterfield held meetings over the weekend with Israelis asking them to do more on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry said 18,205 people had now been killed and 49,645 wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza in just over two months of warfare. Israel has said that some 7,000 of those fatalities were Hamas fighters.

UN Security Council envoys spoke of unimaginable suffering and urged an end to the war in the Gaza Strip on Monday as they made an unusual visit to the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing.

China's representative to the United Nations, Zhang Jun, asked by reporters if he had a message to nations that opposed a ceasefire in Gaza, said simply: ""Enough is enough.""

A majority of UN member states support an immediate and lasting ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza, as dire conditions worsen for its 2.3 million residents.

The United States, which backs Israel, last week vetoed a proposed Security Council demand for an immediate ceasefire as Israeli tanks and troops press an invasion that has displaced most of Gaza's population.

A dozen Security Council envoys attended the trip organized by the United Arab Emirates to visit Rafah, just days after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that thousands of people in the besieged Palestinian enclave were ""simply starving.""

After flying to the town of Al-Arish they were briefed by UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA on conditions in Gaza before heading towards Rafah 30 miles (48 km) away.

""The reality is even worse than what words can speak,"" Ecuador's UN representative, Jose De La Gasca, told reporters after the UNRWA briefing.

US and France representatives did not participate in the trip.

UAE permanent representative to the UN Lana Nusseibeh said the envoys were told Gazans were dying from malnutrition, a collapsing medical system and a lack of water and food, in addition to the actual conflict in itself.

The vast majority of the Palestinian enclave's 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes.

UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini described an ""implosion of civil order"" where Gazans who have not eaten for days looted aid distribution centers and stopped trucks on roads as they tried to secure supplies for their families.

""There is not enough assistance,"" Lazzarini said. ""Hunger is prevailing in Gaza... Most of the people are just sleeping on the concrete.""

Russian envoy Vasily Nebenzia described conditions in Gaza as “catastrophic"" and said that those against a ceasefire should “face the reality and afford dignity to the Palestinians.""

Nebenzia rejected accusations it was hypocritical to condemn Israel when Moscow had invaded Ukraine.

Limited humanitarian aid and fuel deliveries have crossed into Gaza via the Rafah crossing, but aid officials say it comes nowhere near to satisfying the most basic needs of Gazans.

As the UN envoys traveled towards the Rafah border, hundreds of aid trucks were parked along the road leading to the crossing, waiting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza.

UAE's Nusseibeh said Abu Dhabi was coordinating with relevant authorities so that drinkable water could be pumped into Gaza from an Emirati-funded desalination plant in Egypt.

While Israel has turned off the water to Gaza, it is also unclear if Gaza's infrastructure is capable of receiving the desalinated water after weeks of heavy Israeli bombardment.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that 100 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies entered Gaza from Egypt on Sunday, the same number as the previous day.

It noted that was ""well below"" the daily average of 500 truckloads, including fuel, that entered every working day prior to Oct. 7.

The 15-member Security Council is negotiating a UAE-drafted resolution that demands warring parties ""allow the use of all land, sea and air routes to and throughout"" Gaza for aid.

It would also establish a UN-run aid monitoring mechanism in Gaza Strip. It was not clear when the draft resolution could be put to a vote.

NZCTU President Richard Wagstaff said, “The Free Trade Agreement between New Zealand and the European Union contained a chapter setting out protections for workers – the Trade and Sustainable Development chapter. Sections of that agreement would be contravened if the Fair Pay Agreement Bill went ahead in their current format.”

“Specifically, the FTA requires that neither side will ‘weaken or reduce the levels of protection afforded in its environmental or labour law in order to encourage trade or investment’.

“Yet this is precisely the reason given by the government for its determination to remove Fair Agreements. Indeed, the Cabinet Paper states that FPA removal is crucial for business investment”

“Other sections of the FTA are also in doubt, as removing FPAs would also imperil the ability to deliver decent working conditions, and the requirement to cooperate with the EU on core labour standards.

“Should New Zealand repeal FPAs, it would be acting in a manner contrary to the provisions of the agreement. This would severely diminish the country’s strong reputation for upholding our international agreements.”

“The Government has acted too hastily in wanting to remove Fair Pay Agreements for hundreds of thousands of workers around New Zealand. In doing so it has overlooked the impact that it will have on our trading agreements.

“Rather than acting with reckless speed, the Government should actually consult with unions, businesses, and with our international partners on any changes. Now is the time for considered analysis, not ideological attacks on workers core rights.”"

Instead, the island state sees itself more as a galvaniser of financing, she told reporters on Monday (Dec 11), the second last day of the United Nations climate conference.

The loss and damage fund draws from wealthier nations to help countries most vulnerable to climate change cope with its effects.

It was first agreed upon at the COP27 summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt last year and was launched on the first day of this year’s talks.

More than US$400 million was initially pledged, with 225 million euros (US$246 million) from the European Union, US$100 million from the United Arab Emirates, US$40 million from Britain, US$17.5 million from the United States and US$10 million from Japan.

1145783611,20231212,"South Africa’s PetroSA aims to make a final investment decision (FID) by April on a project designed to support the resumption of production at the mothballed gas-to-liquids (GTL) refinery in Mossel Bay, following receipt of Cabinet’s backing for its controversial selection of Russia’s GazpromBank Africa as the project’s investment partner.

The endorsement was made at a special meeting held on December 8, where Cabinet received an update on progress regarding the reinstatement of the GTL refinery, which has been in care and maintenance since November 2020, following the failure of the $1-billion Project Ikhwezi to replenish the refinery’s dwindling supply of indigenous offshore gas.

Cabinet was also updated on the process followed by the Central Energy Fund, PetroSA’s State-owned holding company, to secure a partner with the “requisite technical and financial resources” to return the refinery to full operation on a risk-sharing basis.

The selection of GazpromBank Africa arose after PetroSA issued a request for proposals in January from potential partners that could offer a turnkey solution, including funding and feedstock security, to refurbish, modify and upgrade the decommissioned facility.

In late November, investigative publication amaBhungane revealed that, while 20 companies submitted bids, the evaluation criteria employed by PetroSA resulted in all but GazpromBank Africa being disqualified. This, despite concerns raised internally about the threat of sanctions, given that the US and the European Union had imposed sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.

Cabinet spokesperson Khumbudzo Ntshavheni dismissed arguments that the partnership could posed a secondary sanctions risk, noting various exemptions in place, while highlighting that several other countries, including Brics bloc countries, had ongoing energy trade activities with Russian companies.

In a separate briefing, PetroSA acting COO Sesakho Magadla reported that an independent legal opinion had been obtained, which concluded the sanctions risk to be low, owing to the fact that primary sanctions affected companies and individuals from those countries that had imposed the restrictions, while no secondary sanctions had, to date, been imposed on other countries.

Magadla also suggested that “critical energy security”, along with food and medicines, had been exempted from the sanctions.

“This project falls within that description, because it is also critical for South Africa’s energy security,” she asserted.

The tie-up with a Russian company could, however, have implications for PetroSA’s plans to cooperate with TotalEnergies, of France, on the international energy group’s Brulpadda and Luiperd fields, offshore the South African coast.

However, PetroSA indicated that progress had slowed primarily because of pricing issues, with first gas only expected after 2030.

“We cannot be sitting idle and waiting for 2030 while our plant is rotting,” Magadla added.

Ntshavheni noted that the partnership with GazpromBank Africa remained dependent on the FID decision, which would itself be informed by the outcome of a joint bankable business case.

PetroSA is optimistic of reaching FID with GazpromBank Africa on what has been reported to be a R3.7-billion project during the first quarter of the 2024 calendar year.

The company expects to achieve financial close by the end of the second quarter, after which it expects engineering and construction to be implemented over an 18-month period.

PetroSA acting CEO Sandisiwe Ncemane argued that the reinstatement of the project would support security of fuel supply in the Eastern, Northern and Western Cape provinces in a context of declining domestic refining capacity.

The company also argued that reinstating the GTL refinery as soon as possible would help prevent the asset, which it values at $2.85-billion, from further decay.

However, it acknowledged that significant investment would be required to restart production, owing to the fact that some equipment was either obsolete or in poor condition."

1145799255,20231212,"PARIS (AFP): French artificial intelligence start-up Mistral AI announced Sunday it had raised 385 million euros ($414 million), becoming one of Europe’s two AI leaders.

Founded in May by industry heavyweights, Mistral had already raised 105 million euros in June.

Among European AI firms, only Germany’s Aleph Alpha has brought in as much funding, raising nearly 500 million euros in early November.

This second round of financing, led by Californian fund Andreessen Horowitz, values Mistral at 2 billion euros, according to financial sources — making it a French tech unicorn, with a valuation of over one billion euros.

Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch said the newly announced finding marked “another major step in our acceleration”.

The emergence of European AI players comes as the European Union looks to secure future regulation of the sector, without curbing innovation in the region.

EU member states and lawmakers on Friday clinched a deal on how to draft rules regulating AI models.

France and Germany had initially feared that excessive regulation would hobble their nascent champions.

Among Mistral’s backers are several American tech giants including software publisher Salesforce and also, according to industry sources, the Nvidia group, a global leader in supercomputer chips.

The mobilisation of Silicon Valley’s biggest players reflects the enthusiasm generated by Mistral in just eight months of existence.

US media has already cited it as a potential rival to OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.

Like many of its competitors, Mistral, which has 22 employees, offers companies open-source language models fed by public data.

Its three French co-founders are CEO Mensch, 31, along with Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix — all with experience at major US tech firms, including Meta."

'Our global leaders have the moral duty to use the remaining hours of this climate conference to deliver action compatible with 1.5°C,' says Bishop Gerry Alminaza, chair of the CBCP's National Laudato Si' Program

MANILA, Philippines – As the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai nears its end, several civil society organizations from the Philippines and the region closely following the talks lamented the weak language on fossil fuels and the “refusal” of countries to deliver on climate finance.

During a Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice press conference on Tuesday, December 12 – the supposed last day of COP28 – Filipino climate activist Lidy Nacpil did not mince words as she talked about the negotiations, now entering their most crucial hours after two weeks.

“I wish we could say that we just failed to make progress, but it’s actually even worse than that. On many counts in this process, COP28, we’ve actually gone backwards. On the issue of fossil fuels, the language which is in the current text is worse than what we had in the last two COPs,” Nacpil, the coordinator of the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development, said during the press conference in Dubai.

While the last two COPs or Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change committed to the “phasedown of unabated coal power and phaseout of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” the COP28 draft did not refer to a “phaseout” of fossil fuels. Instead, it listed eight options that countries could use to cut emissions.

“We understand the geopolitical and political economy dynamics in these negotiations are complicated, hence the resulting text on fossil fuels,” Nacpil said.

“But it cannot be discounted that if there is one linchpin problem, it is the fact of the refusal to deliver or even talk about the delivery of climate finance, which makes the entire fossil fuel phaseout important for us in the sense of making sure it’s equitable and just.”

According to Nacpil, talking about a fossil fuel phaseout without talking about climate finance is “just a sham.”

“And the way that the US and other developed countries are styling themselves as climate champions makes us sick when we hear them. Because it is so hypocritical that they’re actually expanding their fossil fuel production and consumption, and it’s so shameless that they’re calling for ambition without talking about the delivery of their obligations to provide finance,” she added.

The United States and the European Union were among countries who called for the strengthening of the draft agreement.

A couple of groups present in Dubai even sent the Philippine delegation their proposed revisions to the draft global stocktake text in hopes that the delegation would guard against weakened language on fossil fuels. (READ: Can the Philippines be a strong voice again at UN climate talks?)

The global stocktake – a process for governments and other stakeholders to track and evaluate their progress toward meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement – is meant to inform countries’ next round of climate action plans, called Nationally Determined Contributions.

Church leaders in the Philippines joined the call for a strong decision against fossil fuels at COP28.

“Thousands of us came to COP28 with the hope that it will deliver the climate action we all so desperately seek. Our young people and vulnerable communities bravely spoke up too,” said Bishop Gerry Alminaza, chair of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines’ National Laudato Si’ Program.

He added: “But the latest global stocktake is crushing that hope. Our global leaders have the moral duty to use the remaining hours of this climate conference to deliver action compatible with 1.5°C, and herald a full and equitable phaseout of all fossil fuels.”

Father Edwin Gariguez, the lead convenor of the Protect the Verde Island Passage network, said the latest global stocktake text “positions itself as an enemy of biodiversity.”

“No inclusion of phaseout implies its blatant support for fossil fuel expansion and destruction of vital biodiversity areas affected by gas developments, such as the Verde Island Passage,” Gariguez said as he warned against the danger that coasts and communities like those in Batangas face.

The province, part of which lies along the Verde Island Passage, has become a preferred area for many liquefied natural gas projects in the Philippines

“Fossil fuel does not have a place in our worsening climate. The retention of fossil fuels as a transitional fuel towards cleaner energy is clearly a counterintuitive solution to address our climate crisis,” Gariguez added.

During Tuesday’s press conference, Nacpil said there have been small victories at COP28, like the adoption of the loss and damage fund on the first day and “some positive points in the just transition package,” but both issues still boil down to the delivery of climate finance.

“This is a dark day. We probably are not very surprised because we’ve seen how the trends were going even before we reached Dubai, then in Dubai,” Nacpil said.

She added: “You know when you know it’s going to come and then it comes? And you’re still as shocked and as enraged even if you knew this was coming? This is how we feel today.” – with a report from Reuters/Rappler.com

The veteran politician and former EU chief’s administration is expected to garner enough backing in parliament to bring to a close eight years of right-wing populist rule.

The Tusk cabinet could be sworn in Wednesday, allowing him to travel to Brussels for an EU summit on Thursday and Friday as the new prime minister.

His address to lawmakers made clear that his government would strive to restore Poland’s credibility in the EU and give it an important voice amid the war in neighbouring Ukraine.

“We will call loud and clear for full mobilisation on the part of the free world, the West in support of Ukraine in this war. There is no alternative,” he said.

He also promised to resolve the month-long blockage at the Ukraine border by Polish hauliers, who are demanding the reintroduction of entry permits for their Ukrainian competitors.

Zelensky makes plea for US aid as Russia claims advances

The show of support for Ukraine appeared to be mutual as its President Volodymyr Zelensky immediately tweeted his “congratulations” Monday after Tusk was tapped as premier.

Speaking to the lower house of parliament – which is controlled by his multi-party alliance – Tusk also expressed a vote of confidence in the European Union.

“We are all the stronger, all the more sovereign when not only Poland is stronger but also the European Union,” Tusk told lawmakers.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also congratulated him on Monday, tweeting: “I look forward to working with you.”

“Your experience and strong commitment to our European values will be precious in forging a stronger Europe,” she added on X.

Tusk, who previously served as prime minister from 2007 to 2014 and was president of the European Council from 2014 to 2019, has promised to unblock billions of euros in EU aid that have been frozen because of long-standing tensions between Brussels and the outgoing government.

Tusk also presented his roster of ministers. The parliament is due to weigh in on the proposed cabinet later Tuesday.

The confidence vote comes on the heels of the outgoing conservatives’ failure to form a government of their own for lack of viable coalition partners.

The right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party won the most seats in October’s general election but failed to win a majority.

Zelensky arrives in US to plead for continued Ukraine war aid

Still, PiS prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki was given the first crack at forming a new government and his proposed cabinet failed to muster enough backing in parliament Monday.

While Tusk’s Civic Coalition came second in the ballot, it secured a majority by joining up with two smaller pro-EU opposition political groups, the Third Way and Left.

‘Right all of the wrongs’

Describing the right-wing administration as years of “darkness”, Tusk said Monday that his government would work to “right all of the wrongs”.

His arch-nemesis, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, fired back by accusing Tusk of being a “German agent” and rued “the end of democracy”.

Freedom hero and Nobel Prize winner Lech Walesa – known for despising the PiS – said Monday he was “happy that Poland is back on the path of development”.

Expectations for the new government are running high but the populists will remain very influential and have appointed allies to key posts during their time in power.

The next government will face daily battles with PiS which “will continue to fight”, Jaroslaw Kuisz, a political analyst, told AFP. “There won’t be any miracles.”

Controversial judicial reforms and appointments, which the EU said undermined democratic values, were at the heart of tensions between PiS ministers and Brussels.

PiS still has allies in the presidency, the central bank and the supreme court, as well as in several important judicial and financial state institutions.

Polish President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the outgoing government, is due to step down ahead of a presidential election in 2025 but he could use blocking tactics between now and then, vetoing legislation."

1145827254,20231212,"In a significant development, negotiators from the European Parliament and EU member states have reached a consensus on more stringent regulations governing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) within the European Union. The historic accord was finalized on Friday evening in Brussels following extensive deliberations. This groundbreaking move, as declared by the EU Parliament, marks the world's inaugural AI law.

Artificial intelligence, commonly associated with applications rooted in machine learning, involves the utilization of software to analyze extensive datasets, identify patterns, and derive informed conclusions. The prevalence of AI is evident in various domains, such as the accelerated and precise evaluation of computer tomography images, a task performed more efficiently by AI programs than their human counterparts.

AI also plays a pivotal role in endeavors like the predictive capabilities of self-driving cars, which anticipate the actions of other road users. Additionally, AI is integrated into everyday applications such as chatbots and automated playlists on streaming services.

The proposed legislation, put forth by the EU Commission in April 2021, advocates for the categorization of AI systems into different risk groups. The regulatory requirements will be commensurate with the potential hazards associated with each application. The overarching objective is to establish a global precedent, with the hope that these regulations will be adopted internationally.

Despite the momentous agreement, negotiations faced a critical juncture, particularly concerning the regulation of so-called basic models. These robust AI models, trained on extensive datasets, serve as the foundation for a myriad of applications, including prominent examples like GPT. Divergent viewpoints emerged, with Germany, France, and Italy advocating for the regulation of specific AI applications while excluding the fundamental technology itself. Disagreements also surfaced over the proposed regulations for facial recognition employing AI, especially concerning national security applications.

While the European Parliament and member states still need to formally endorse the agreed-upon initiative, this final step is anticipated to be a mere formality. The culmination of these deliberations represents a pivotal moment in the global discourse on AI regulation, with the potential to influence regulatory frameworks beyond the borders of the European Union."

1145852993,20231212,"This Tuesday, the European Parliament posthumously awarded the 2023 Sakharov Prize to Jina Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian girl who died in police custody last year in Tehran, the capital of Iran. The award was scheduled to be presented to Amini’s parents and brother, something that has not been possible after the Iranian regime confiscated their passports when they were preparing to travel to France – the award ceremony is held in Strasbourg. On her behalf, the family’s lawyer, Saleh Nikbakht, a veteran defender of political prisoners in Iran, who was sentenced to a year in prison last August for spreading, according to the accusation, “propaganda against the State”. Amini died on September 16, 2022, three days after being arrested by the morality police for not wearing the Islamic headscarf correctly. Her death has sparked the largest protests in Iran since 1979.

In recognition of the fight for freedom and human rights that Iranians have waged for months in the streets throughout the country, the European Parliament has also awarded the Sakharov to the feminist movement Women, Life and Freedom, born from the protests. As representatives of the movement, Mersedeh Shahinkar and Afsoon Najafi collected the award, whom the European Parliament recognized for their bravery, strength and activism in favor of women’s freedom in Iran.

The Sakharov Prize was presented by the President of Parliament, Roberta Metsola, who highlighted that the laurel is “a tribute to all those defiant and brave women, men, boys and girls who have taken to the streets despite the enormous repression that exercised by the regime, and that to this day they continue to pressure for change to occur.” Metsola has also referred to the actions that the European Union has taken to force this change in Iran, recalling that “the European Parliament has approved many resolutions that condemn the Iranian regime and its attempts to silence its people, as well as officials who “They exercise repression against women.” Finally, she stressed that the Chamber has previously asked Member States to “redouble” sanctions against those responsible for the repression and to “include Iran’s Revolutionary Guard on the list of terrorist organizations” of the EU. .

After collecting the award, lawyer Saleh Nikbakht read a letter written by Amini’s mother addressed to the parliamentary representatives. “I would have liked to be here to represent all the women of my land and to thank the awarding of the Sakharov Prize. Unfortunately, we have been denied this possibility in a clear violation of human rights. Jina is the embodiment of life. Her name will always be the symbol of freedom, of all oppressed women and of all those who have unjustly lost their lives. The regime believed that by taking her life her dreams would disappear, but that was not the case. From her ashes a new spirit has been reborn. They did not know, and they still do not know, that Jina was a free spirit who represents values ​​that have no borders: justice, freedom, peace, coexistence, equality. “I am convinced that my daughter’s name will be remembered as the name of freedom forever,” the lawyer read, provoking applause from the European Parliament.

For their part, Mersedeh Shahinkar and Afsoon Najafi have thanked Parliament for the award and have asked Western governments to increase pressure on the regime so that those who kill people stop doing so. “You can help us. The time has come when politicians must stop reaching out to them, supporting them, knowing as they do everything that has happened and the many deaths caused with their rifles. The Women, Life and Freedom movement must continue,” Afsoon Najafi exclaimed in a previous press conference.

Afsoon Najafi’s sister, Hadis Najafi, was murdered by the Iranian regime in September 2022 after being shot several times while attending a demonstration in the city of Karaj protesting the mandatory hijab. Afsoon Najafi notoriously denounced the death of her sister on social media and, after suffering harassment and threats from the intelligence services, she left Iran and currently lives in exile.

Mersedeh Shahinkar lost his right eye in October 2022 as a result of the impact of a projectile launched by security forces when he was at a demonstration with his mother in Tehran. The image of Shahinkar on the ground with a bloody eye soon went viral, and her case joined that of many other young Iranians who in the last year have reported on social media the loss of an eye due to police shooting. But Shahinkar’s ordeal did not end there. Weeks after the attack, and after raising her voice against the system’s repression repeatedly on her Instagram account, plainclothes agents showed up at her house and confiscated her cell phone and other belongings, after which the now-awarded winner left the country with his daughter. She currently resides in Germany on humanitarian leave.

After Amini’s death, Tehran has brutally repressed protests for months, causing more than 500 deaths and thousands of injuries and arrests. Furthermore, the Revolutionary Guard systematically harasses the relatives of the deceased, preventing ceremonies in their memory from being held. On the first anniversary of Amini’s death, on September 16, security forces arrested the girl’s father, Amjad Amini, releasing him a few hours later. The intelligence services prohibited the father from approaching her daughter’s grave to commemorate the anniversary of her death. Likewise, Amini’s tomb, which has become a symbol of resistance in Iran against the atrocious discrimination against women, remains constantly under surveillance.

The regime has managed to silence the protests after months of violence but has not managed to defeat the combative spirit exhibited by Iranian women in the Women, Life and Freedom movement. To counter this expression of civil resistance, the Iranian Parliament this year approved a law that toughens penalties against women who violate the Islamic dress code and the mandatory use of the hijab in public spaces.

The finalists of the Sakharov 2023 were the lawyer Vilma Núñez Escorcia and the bishop Rolando José Álvarez Lagos, both from Nicaragua, and three women who fight for legal, safe and free abortion: the Polish Justyna Wydrzynska, the Salvadoran Morena Herrera and the American Colleen McNicholas.

First awarded in 1988, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Conscience recognizes individuals, groups and organizations that have made an outstanding contribution to the protection of freedom of conscience. It is the highest award granted by the European Union in the field of human rights and is endowed with 50,000 euros.

1145865627,20231212,"Finland will reopen two crossings on its border with Russia, its prime minister said Tuesday, after Helsinki in November shut its frontier, accusing Moscow of orchestrating a surge in migrants.

“The government has today decided to keep the eastern border closed except for two border crossing points,” Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said.

Helsinki will open the southeastern border crossing points of Vaalimaa and Niirala on Thursday.

Orpo said that the restrictions have been eased in order to assess whether “there is a change for the better.”

“If the phenomenon continues, we will close these border crossings,” he added.

Following an influx of migrants in mid-November, Finland closed four of its eight border crossings with Russia, before restricting passage only to the northernmost crossing. That too was closed by the end of November.

The Nordic country, which shares a 1,340-kilometre (830-mile) border with Russia, had seen nearly 1,000 migrants arrive without a visa through its eastern border crossings since August.

“This is an organised activity, not a genuine emergency,” Orpo said of the surge.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denied at the time that Russia was acting deliberately.

Finnish authorities maintain that the surge in migrant numbers may continue.

“It is possible that Russia will continue its operation,” the prime minister said.

The European Union’s border protection agency Frontex deployed some 50 guards to watch Finland’s border with Russia in December.

Finland’s relations with its eastern neighbour soured after the invasion of Ukraine.

Moscow warned of “countermeasures” after Finland joined NATO in April, reversing its decades-long policy of military non-alignment."

Having assessed the progress of Ukraine's reforms, Slovakia is ""ready to support the opening of accession negotiations,"" Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said in Brussels on Dec. 12.

The statement comes days before a European Council summit on Dec. 14, where Hungary is expected to try to block the launch of Ukraine's EU membership talks. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico is an ally of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

The European Commission published its official recommendation on Nov. 8 that Ukraine was ready for talks to begin.

According to Blanar, Ukraine still has a ""long and thorny road ahead, so that all the necessary measures are not only adopted, but also implemented.""

Peace and rebuilding of Ukraine should bring the country closer to the EU, Blanar said.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described Blanar's statement as a positive signal from Slovakia.

Kuleba, who was speaking on air on the afternoon of Dec. 12, said that he believes Hungary does not want to block Ukraine's EU membership, but wants a ""slower accession process and a more careful study of the consequences of this accession.""

""There is not a single EU country that does not want to see Ukraine as part of the European Union,"" Kuleba said.

Kuleba said that on top of the positive signal from Slovakia, he had received a ""cautious signal"" from Hungary following his meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Peter Szijjarto on Dec. 11. ""Everything will be decided at the last minute,"" Kuleba said.

Ukrainian and Western leaders and officials are seeking to sway Budapest away from blocking the start of Ukraine's membership talks.

Following their meeting, Hungarian Foreign Minister Szijjarto claimed that Hungary's position was unchanged.

Szijjarto and Kuleba's meeting on Dec. 11 was the first time the two met in person since the start of the full-scale invasion. Szijjarto has visited Russia five times since February 2022."

1145902921,20231205,"European Union officials made tech policy history last week by enduring 36 hours of grueling debate in order to finally settle on a first of its kind, comprehensive AI safety and transparency framework called the AI Act. Supporters of the legislation and AI safety experts told PopSci they believe the new guidelines are the strongest of their kind worldwide and could set an example for other nations to follow.

The legally binding frameworks set crucial new transparency requirements for OpenAI and other generative AI developers. It also draws several red lines banning some of the most controversial uses of AI, from real-time facial recognition scanning and so-called emotion recognition to predictive policing techniques. But there could be a problem brewing under the surface. Even when the Act is voted on, Europe’s AI cops won’t actually be able to enforce any of those rules until 2025 at the earliest. By then, it’s anyone’s guess what the ever-evolving AI landscape will look like.

What is the EU AI Act?

The EU’s AI Act breaks AI tools and applications into four distinct “risk categories” with those placed on the highest end of the spectrum exposed to the most intense regulatory scrutiny. AI systems considered high risk, which would include self-driving vehicles, tools managing critical infrastructure, medical devices, and biometric identification systems among others, would be required to undergo fundamental rights impact assessments, adhere to strict new transparency requirements, and must be registered in a public EU database. The companies responsible for these systems will also be subject to monitoring and record keeping practices to ensure EU regulators the tools in question don’t pose a threat to safety or fundamental human rights.

It’s important here to note that the EU still needs to vote on the Act and a final version of the text has not been made public. A final vote for the legation is expected to occur in early 2024.

The AI Act goes a step further and bans other use cases outright. In particular, the framework prohibits mass, untargeted scraping of face images from the internet or CCTV footage to create a biometric database. This could potentially impact well known facial recognition startups like Clearview AI and PimEyes, which reportedly scrape the public internet for billions of face scans. Jack Mulcaire, Clearview AI’s General Counsel, told PopSci it does not operate in or offer its products in the EU. PimEyes did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

Emotion recognition, which controversially attempts to use biometric scans to detect an individual’s feeling or state of mind, will be banned in the workplace and schools. Other AI systems that “manipulate human behavior to circumvent their free will” are similarly prohibited. AI-based “social scoring” systems, like those notoriously deployed in mainland China, also fall under the banned category.

Tech companies found sidestepping these rules or pressing on with banned applications could see fines ranging between 1.5% and 7% of their total revenue depending on the violation and the company’s size. This penalty system is what gives the EU AI Act teeth and what fundamentally separates it from other voluntary transparency and ethics commitments recently secured by the Biden Administration in the US. Biden’s White House also recently signed a first-of-its kind AI executive order laying out his vision for future US AI regulation.

In the immediate future, large US tech firms like OpenAI and Google who operate “general purpose AI systems” will be required to keep up EU officials up to date on how they train their models, report summaries of the types of data they use to train those models, and create a policy acknowledging they will agree to adhere to EU copyright laws. General models deemed to pose a “systemic risk,” a label Bloomberg estimates currently only includes OpenAI’s GPT, will be subject to a stricter set of rules. Those could include requirements forcing the model’s maker to report the tool’s energy use and cybersecurity compliance, as well as calls for them to perform red teaming exercises to identify and potentially mitigate signs of systemic risk.

Generative AI models and capable of creating potentially misleading “deepfake” media will be required to clearly label those creations as AI-generated. Other US AI companies that create tools falling under the AI Act’s “unacceptable” risk category would likely no longer be able to continue operating in the EU when the legislation officially takes effect.

[ Related: “The White House’s plan to deal with AI is as you’d expect” ]

AI Now Institute Executive Director Amba Kak Tod spoke positively of the AI Act, telling PopSci it was a “crucial counterpoint in a year that has otherwise largely been a deluge of weak voluntary proposals.” Tod said the red lines barring particularly threatening uses of AI and new transparency and diligence requirements were a welcome “step in the right direction.”

Though supporters of the EU’s risk-based approach say it’s helpful to avoid subjecting more mundane AI use cases to overbearing regulation, some European privacy experts worry the structure places too little emphasis on fundamental human rights and detracts from past the approach of psst EU legislation like the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights of the European Union (CFREU).

“The risk based approach is in tension with the rest of the EU human rights frameworks, “European Digital Rights Senior Policy Advisor Ella Jakubowska told PopSci during a phone interview. “The entire framework that was on the table from the beginning was flawed.”

The AI Act’s risk-based approach, Jakubowska warned, may not always provide a full, clear picture of how certain seemingly low risk AI tools could be used in the future. Jakubowska said rights advocates like herself would prefer mandatory risk assessments for all developers of AI systems.

Daniel Leufer, a Senior Policy Analyst for the digital rights organization AccessNow echoed those concerns regarding the risk-based approach, which he argues were designed partly as a concession to tech industry groups and law enforcement. Leufer says AccessNow and other digital rights organizations had to push EU member states to agree to include “unacceptable” risk categories, which some initially refused to acknowledge. Tod, the AI Now Institute Executive Director, went on to say the AI Act could have done more to clarify regulations around AI applications in law enforcement and national security domains.

The framework agreed upon last week was the culmination of years’ worth of back and forth debate between EU member states, tech firms, and civil society organizations. First drafts of the AI Act date back to 2021, months before OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E generative AI tools enraptured the minds of millions. The skeleton of the legislation reportedly dates back even further still to as early as 2018.

Much has changed since then. Even the most prescient AI experts would have struggled to imagine witnessing hundreds of top technologists and business leaders frantically adding their names to impassioned letters urging a moratorium on AI tech to supposedly safeguard humanity. Few similarly could have predicted the current wave of copyright lawsuits lodged against generative AI makers questioning the legality of their massive data scraping techniques or the torrent of AI-generated clickbait filling the web.

Similarly, it’s impossible to predict what the AI landscape will look like in 2025, which is the earliest the EU could actually enforce its hefty new regulations. Axios notes EU officials will urge companies to agree to the rules in the meantimes, but on a voluntary basis."

1145918268,20231212,"Israeli tanks and warplanes bombarded the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, killing dozens of Palestinians, and US President Joe Biden warned Israel it was losing international support because of its ""indiscriminate"" bombing of civilians in its war against Hamas militants.

In a further sign of world concern over the conduct of the conflict, now in its third month, Australia, Canada and New Zealand said they supported international efforts towards a sustainable ceasefire. They expressed alarm at the plight of civilians in Gaza.

At the United Nations, the 193-member UN General Assembly was preparing to vote on a resolution calling for a ceasefire. Diplomats said it was expected to pass. The United States vetoed a similar call in the 15-member Security Council last week.

Biden said Israel now has support from ""most of the world"" including the US and the European Union. ""But they're starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,"" he told a campaign fundraising event in Washington.

Israel's assault on Gaza to root out Hamas has killed at least 18,205 Palestinians and wounded nearly 50,000 since 7 October, according to the Gaza health ministry. Many more dead are uncounted under the rubble or beyond the reach of ambulances.

Israel launched its onslaught in response to a cross-border raid by Hamas fighters who killed 1200 people and took 240 hostage in southern Israel on 7 October.

In Khan Younis, southern Gaza's main city, residents said on Tuesday Israeli tank shelling was now focused on the city centre. One said tanks were operating on Tuesday morning in the street where the house of Yahya Al-Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, is located.

An elderly Palestinian, Tawfik Abu Breika, said his residential block in Khan Younis was hit without warning by an Israeli air strike on Tuesday that had brought down several buildings and caused casualties.

""The world's conscience is dead, no humanity or any kind of morals,"" Breika told Reuters as neighbours sifted through rubble. ""This is the third month that we are facing death and destruction...This is ethnic cleansing, complete destruction of the Gaza Strip to displace the whole population.""

Further south in Rafah, which borders Egypt, health officials said 22 people including children were killed in an Israeli air strike on houses overnight. Civil emergency workers were searching for more victims under the rubble.

Residents said the shelling of Rafah, where the Israeli army this month ordered people to head for their safety, was some of the heaviest in days.

""At night we can't sleep because of the bombing and in the morning we tour the streets looking for food for the children, there is no food,"" said Abu Khalil, 40, a father of six.

Gazans were battling hunger and thirst to survive, resident Mohammed Obaid said as he inspected debris in Rafah.

""There's no electricity, no fuel, no water, no medicine.""

The Gaza health ministry said that diseases and illnesses including diarrhoea, food poisoning, meningitis, respiratory infections, chickenpox and scabies were speading.

Washington has shared Israel's position that a ceasefire would only benefit Hamas. But in addition to warning that Israel was starting to lose international support, Biden said that Netanyahu needed to change his hardline government.

The leaders of Australia, Canada and New Zealand said in a joint statement they were alarmed at the diminishing safe space for civilians in Gaza.

""The price of defeating Hamas cannot be the continuous suffering of all Palestinian civilians,"" they said.

Israel's military said that over the past day it hit several posts that were used to fire rockets at its territory, raided a Hamas compound where it found some 250 rockets among other weapons and struck a weapons production factory.

The ground assault that started in the north has expanded to the southern half of the Gaza Strip since a week-long truce collapsed at the start of December. More than 100 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the ground invasion began in late October.

Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said Israeli forces had raided Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza on Tuesday and detained the hospital director, Dr Ahmed Al-Kahlout, along with all medical staff including female teams.

They were being interrogated under threat within the emergency department, he said. Israel's military did not reply to a request for comment on the incident.

An air strike on a house in Rafah killed several people and another on a building near the centre in Khan Younis killed one Palestinian, medics said.

Hunger is worsening, with the UN World Food Programme saying half of Gaza's population is starving as Israel has cut off supplies of food, medicine and fuel.

The UN humanitarian office OCHA said on Tuesday limited aid distributions were taking place in the Rafah district, but ""in the rest of the Gaza Strip, aid distribution has largely stopped over the past few days, due to the intensity of hostilities and restrictions of movement along the main roads"".

The UN Palestinian Refugee Agency (UNRWA) said Israel had imposed a near-total siege on Gaza ""inflicting collective punishment on over 2 million people, half of whom are children"".

The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war, a charge an Israeli official rejected as ""obscene"".

1145940127,20231213,"Israel is facing growing diplomatic isolation in its war against Hamas as the United Nations demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza and US President Joe Biden told the longtime ally its ""indiscriminate"" bombing of civilians was hurting international support.

The Palestinian Authority welcomed the resolution and urged countries to pressure Israel to comply. A Hamas official in exile, Izzat El-Reshiq, in a statement on Telegram echoed that reaction, saying Israel should ""stop its aggression, genocide, and ethnic cleansing against our people"".

Before the UN vote, Israel's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan said: ""A ceasefire means one thing and one thing only - ensuring the survival of Hamas, ensuring the survival of genocidal terrorists committed to the annihilation of Israel and Jews.""

Before the resolution, Biden said Israel now has support from ""most of the world"" including the US and European Union for its fight against the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

In the most public sign of division between the leaders so far, Biden also said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needed to change his hardline government and that ultimately Israel ""can't say no"" to an independent Palestinian state - something that Israeli hardliners oppose.

The conflict has also led to starvation, displaced 85 per cent of the population from their homes and caused diseases to spread, according to the UN and Gaza health ministry.

Israel launched its onslaught after a cross-border raid by Hamas fighters who killed 1200 people and took 240 hostage in southern Israel on October 7. Israel on Tuesday declared 19 of 134 people still in captivity in Gaza dead in absentia after the bodies of two hostages were recovered.

The UN resolution is not binding but carries political weight, reflecting a global view on the war. The United States vetoed a similar call in the 15-member Security Council last week but does not have a veto in the General Assembly.

Tuesday's resolution got 153 votes in favour, 10 against and 23 abstentions. In an indication of weakening support for Israel, the resolution passed by a wider margin than a similar UN measure in October, which got 121 votes in favour, 14 against and 44 abstentions.

In the south Gaza town of Rafah, which borders Egypt and where the Israeli army this month told civilians they would be safe, Gazans said the shelling was some of the heaviest in days. Health officials said 22 people including children were killed there."

For ordinary Ukrainians, there have been some worrying signs from the West.

Defence spending bills, which included support for Ukraine, and critical funding from Brussels have been delayed.

The once unwavering Western support for a Ukraine victory has hit some speedbumps, but for us, it is absolutely a life and death question to lead and be a part of all the Western institutions and help form the future of Europe.

For Ukraine, Europe means more than just a dream goal – it embodies the principles of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights that our citizens fervently cherish.

Our path to Europe is not solely a political choice; it is an absolutely existential one.

We are not only fighting to become part of the European Union; we are striving to solidify our identity that has always been European, away from Russia. We don’t want them to occupy our consciousness and our historic memory. We want to put an end to any possible will of evil to kill our right to live with freedom on our land.

Despite the ongoing Russian aggression, Ukraine remains steadfast in its commitment to European and democratic values, continuing to implement the reforms necessary for our membership.

I am happy that our European partners are taking an objective view of Ukraine and recognising our achievements, particularly the progress in constitutional justice, the anti-corruption programme and the fight against money laundering. Many of the necessary legislative reforms have been adopted by our parliament despite the ongoing security situation, air sirens and often bombardment of Kyiv.

The European Commission’s recommendation to start accession negotiations is a significant step forward. The next crucial strategic action is the adoption of this decision by EU leaders in mid-December.

The approach towards Ukraine should be in tandem with the European Union’s next strategic agenda, which itself should be based on several key, related imperatives:
• Accelerating Ukraine’s membership in the EU. Recently, our European colleagues have often stated that the reform of the bloc itself should precede the admission of new members. It is important that the reform of the European Union does not hinder the integration of new members.

The EU must realise that any delay in Ukraine’s accession automatically provides Russia with the opportunity to increase its influence in my country’s territory. For this goal, the bloc can provide technical and financial support to Ukraine to implement the necessary reforms and increase public support for Ukraine’s membership. This can be achieved through joint educational programmes, media campaigns and cultural exchanges aimed at promoting understanding and bolstering support.

Equally important is the removal of trade barriers and an increase in the EU’s foreign direct investment in Ukraine to aid in the country’s reconstruction.

As Ukraine progresses towards fulfilling the criteria for EU membership, strategic allocation of reconstruction funds should prioritise initiatives aimed at modernising infrastructure, enhancing healthcare accessibility and nurturing economic resilience. By channelling resources towards the reconstruction and development of Ukraine, the EU can fortify its own foundations while extending the mantle of stability and prosperity across the wider European landscape. I am convinced that Ukrainian reconstruction is not only about Ukraine; it is, in fact, about the reconstruction of Europe in a deeper sense.
• Strengthening the defence and democratic security of the bloc. The EU should invest more in its military mobility, bolster mechanisms of mutual assistance and cooperation, introduce early-stage reactions to threats that hinder the democracy of member states and consistently extend anti-Russian sanctions.

Specific attention should be given to analysing the roots of radical movements in Europe and countering information manipulation. Russian propaganda continues to advance the Kremlin’s agenda abroad, aiming to diminish support for Ukraine globally, hinder European stability, prosperity and peace and regain its lost influence. Russia’s objective is to freeze the war and prepare for new aggression.
• Rethinking what Europe is. The future of Europe demands a reevaluation of its core identity and values as well as tools, institutional efficiency and ability to address up-to-date challenges.

And let’s be honest: Europe needs reforms to improve its institutional effectiveness and flexibility. This shall include the processes of decision-making, accepting new members, internal communications, proactive resilience and the ability to address pressing challenges.

It is imperative to engage in robust discussions and dialogues about the essence and vision of the EU within the bloc. This reevaluation of Europe’s identity and principles should incorporate the aspirations of Ukraine and other countries aspiring for EU membership. It should underscore Europe’s role as a global actor committed to long-lasting peace, stability, and cooperation while adeptly adapting to contemporary realities.

The European Union stands at a critical juncture that necessitates unwavering support for Ukraine’s accession and a resolute defence of democratic principles. The upcoming decisions by EU leaders in mid-December carry immense significance, shaping not only the future of Ukraine but also the character of a Europe united in its principles and aspirations for decades ahead.

Bogor, Indonesia, 11 December 2023 – For the third year in a row, the week-long High-Performance Computing (HPC) School for South-East Asian researchers kicked-off, this time in Bogor, Indonesia. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is set to continue to inspire researchers in the region, following the HPC School’s successful first two editions, organised by the European Union (EU) in collaboration with Japan and ASEAN.

The Indonesian National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) leads the organisation of the ASEAN HPC School 2023. More than 80 carefully selected participants address HPC applications in Life Sciences, Urgent Computing, Climate Science, and Computer Science in Bogor, Indonesia, from 11 to 16 December 2023.

The growing dependence on technology for addressing global challenges emphasises the significance of enhancing HPC skills and knowledge within the ASEAN region. Joint efforts of the EU, Japan and ASEAN resulted in the 1st EU-ASEAN HPC School, held virtually in 2021, and the 2nd EU-ASEAN HPC School held at the Kasetsart University in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2022.

The ASEAN HPC School 2023 marks a new era with an ASEAN Member State organising and managing the school. This contributes to deepening digital connectivity, encouraging innovation, optimising resources and cost sharing to overcome high entry barriers to HPC. At the same time, the school creates opportunities for growing talents in ASEAN as they meet leading international HPC experts, including the 2013 Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Turing Laureate Dr Leslie Lamport.

H.E. Sujiro Seam, Ambassador of the European Union to ASEAN explained: “The HPC schools expose exceptional South-East Asian researchers, primarily at the postgraduate level, to a hands-on curriculum taught by international luminaries in HPC technology from Japan, Europe, South-East Asia and beyond.” He added: “The EU recognises the growing importance of HPC, and is making significant investments in HPC infrastructure through the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking – EuroHPC JU.”

The EU has supported the 2021, 2022 and 2023 HPC schools through the Enhanced Regional EU-ASEAN Dialogue Instrument (E-READI).

1146016860,20231213,"The World Bank has announced a resumption of direct budget support to the Malawi Government with a $137 million (about K232 billion) package to support local efforts to boost reforms and restore macro-economic stability.

The announcement comes after the World Bank board of executive directors approved the Malawi First Growth and Resilience Development Policy Operation with Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat-DDO). This is the first time since 2017 that the World Bank will be giving budget support to the country.

In an e-mailed statement, World Bank country director for Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, Nathan Belete, said he was pleased the BrettonWoods institution can now provide direct budget support to complement an ongoing programme of reforms that are “tough but necessary to stabilise an acute macro-economic crisis”.

He said: “The bank will also continue to work closely with the authorities and all international partners to protect the poorest while pursuing a much-needed economic turnaround. Together, we must ensure this operation marks a turning point in the country’s economic fortunes.”

The package will comprise an immediate release of $80 million (K136 billion) to support reforms to enhance fiscal sustainability and transparency, stimulate private sector-led growth and increase resilience to exogenous shocks.

It will also includes a $57 million (about K96 billion) CAT-DDO that the government can trigger during a crisis.

Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs officials were not readily available for comment as we went to press at 6pm yesterday.

But the World Bank statement quotes Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Simplex Chithyola as having said the support was a significant milestone in Malawi’s ongoing reform journey.

He said: “It shows the increased confidence that the World Bank has in our ongoing efforts to reform the economy and become a self-reliant, industrialised upper middle-income country by 2063.”

Malawi has won favour with some sections of multilateral and bilateral donors after it implemented some reforms, including the 44 percent kwacha devaluation to re-align it with its market value and committing to debt restructuring to secure an Extended Credit Facility programme with the International Monetary Fund.

Since clinching the deal, the European Union announced plans to front-load about 60 million Euro before the end of the year to inject some forex in the local economy.

Donors such as the World Bank, the EU, Norway and the United Kingdom, under what was called the Common Approach to Budget Support, stopped providing direct budget support to Malawi in September 2013 following revelations of Cashgate, the plunder of public resources at Capital Hill through inflated invoices, payment for goods and services not rendered or delivered and fraud.

The development left Malawi with a 40 percent hole in the recurrent budget and about 80 percent in the development budget as the donors opted to channel resources in form of off-budget support through international non-governmental organisations."

1146040936,20231213,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday urged allies in Europe and the US to continue to back Kyiv, as disputes in Brussels and Washington hold up new aid packages.

He was speaking ahead of a meeting with the leaders of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, in which he will seek financial support for more weapons production.

“You can’t win without help,” Zelensky told reporters after talks with Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.

“But you can’t lose, because (all) you have (is) your country.”

In both the US and the European Union, internal disagreements are holding up aid packages for Ukraine worth billions of dollars.

With the counter-offensive launched by Ukraine in July failing to yield the anticipated results, Zelensky is trying to bolster support.

Zelensky was due to meet later Wednesday with Norway’s King Harald before joining the summit with the five Nordic leaders.

Zelensky wants them to help finance Ukraine’s manufacture of NATO-compatible weapons.

In an op-ed published Wednesday in the Financial Times, the five Nordic leaders said “Ukraine cannot defend itself against Russia with only words. The war is not won without weapons.

“Now is not the time to tire,” they added.

Zelensky, after a visit Sunday to Argentina for the inauguration of libertarian President Javier Milei, travelled to the United States in a last-ditch plea for more military aid.

But a divided Congress is still to approve a fresh $60-billion aid package.

Since the start of the war in February 2022, the Nordic countries have been major donors to Kyiv.

Earlier this year Norway announced a civilian and military aid package of 6.8 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to Ukraine over 2023-2027.

On Wednesday, Oslo annonce it was donating just over 250 million euros to Ukraine as part of this package, as well as new much-needed anti-air defence weapons. Ukraine is facing heavy Russian bombing.

More than 50 people were injured overnight in a missile strike on Kyiv.

Norway and Denmark have already provided Ukraine with tanks, weapons and munitions and have pledged F-16 fighters to the Ukrainian army.

When they meet in Brussels from Thursday, European leaders will discuss the opening of EU membership talks with Ukraine and a push to give Kyiv 50 billion euros ($54 billion) in aid over the next four years.

But they face opposition from Hungary, Russia’s closest ally in the bloc.

“We must give Ukraine what it needs to be strong today,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told MEPs on Wednesday.

US President Joe Biden, speaking after talks with Zelensky on Tuesday, warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin was banking on the United States abandoning Ukraine.

“We must, we must, we must prove him wrong,” said Biden. Letting Ukraine lose would embolden Putin “and would-be aggressors everywhere”, he added.

Biden said he had approved a further $200 million in US military aid to tide Ukraine over for coming weeks.

But without a deal in Congress, funding could dry up by the end of the year, the White House warned.

US Republicans are insisting that renewing Ukraine aid depends on the Democrats agreeing to measures on US-Mexico border security and immigration reform.

Moscow meanwhile claimed fresh battlefield advances and predicted Tuesday that any new assistance for Kyiv would be a “fiasco”."

1146062175,20231213,"US President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday that Israel is losing support over its “indiscriminate” bombing of Gaza and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should “change his government”, Reuters news agency reported.

Biden’s remarks were reportedly made to donors to his 2024 re-election campaign and were his most critical to date of Netanyahu’s handling of Israel’s war in Gaza.

“Israel’s security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world,” Biden was quoted as saying. “But they’re starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place.” he reportedly added.

Biden went on to cite a private discussion with Netanyahu in which Israel’s prime minister likened the Gaza conflict to the Second World War and observed that “a lot of civilians died” in Allied bombing raids.

However, Biden said he rejected that comparison and told Netanyahu that “all these institutions were set up after World War II to see to it that it didn’t happen again.”

Calling Netanyahu’s Administration “the most conservative government in Israel’s history,” Biden said the prime minister must “change his government,” without elaborating, only adding that it had made long-term solutions “very difficult.”

“We have an opportunity to begin to unite the region… and they still want to do it. But we have to make sure that (Netanyahu) understands that he’s got to make some moves… You cannot say no Palestinian state,” the president continued.

In a statement earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu insisted that he would never “repeat the mistake of Oslo,” referring to a 1993 peace deal that created a roadmap for a Palestinian state.

Despite Biden’s more critical comments to donors, elsewhere he has continued to voice staunch support for Israel’s military operation. During a White House event to mark the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah on Monday, he told attendees “I am a Zionist” while reiterating Washington’s “unshakable” commitment to Israel’s security.

Moreover, Biden continues to urge lawmakers to approve a spending package that includes $14.3 billion in military aid for Israel and recently bypassed a congressional review to fast-track the sale of $106.5 million in tank shells to the Israeli army.

According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, 18,412 Palestinians have been killed and more than 50,000 wounded in Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza starting on October 7. Palestinian and international estimates say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children."

1146071601,20231213,"Some two years of talking about gig worker rights later and European Union lawmakers have finally reached a deal on the final shape of the Platform Worker Directive.

The development could deliver a significant boost for millions of gig workers laboring on digital platforms without being afforded workers rights. The EU estimates some 5.5 million people currently laboring for such platforms in the region may be wrongly classified as self employed (aka “bogus self employment”), meaning they are missing out on important labor and social rights protections.

The Commission presented its original plan to reform labor laws to boost protections for platform workers back in December 2021, setting out a presumption of employment for workers in a bid to flip the odds on gig economy exploitation. But the proposal proved contentious, with heavy industry lobbying from tech platforms such as Uber pushing for gig workers to be carved out of Europe’s employment protections.

There were also divisions between Member States over how much worker protection vs platform shielding they were prepared to commit to. But after a final trilogue, lasting more than 12 hours, a provisional agreement has been clinched.

Rappoteur and MEP Elisabetta Gualmini trumpeted the deal as “historic”, claiming the directive would advance workers rights for millions of gig workers across Europe.

“It is an historic deal because, basically for the first time, we build up a framework of social rights for millions of workers in Europe who are among the most the precarious,” she said during a press conference this morning to announcing the provisional agreement. “This is the first act that deals with the labour market of the future.”

The deal that’s been provisionally agreed means a presumption of an employment relationship between a gig worker and a platform will be triggered when two out of a list of five “indicators of control or direction are present”, as the parliament’s press release puts it.

“This list can be expanded by Member States. The presumption can be triggered by the worker, by their representatives, and by the competent authorities on their own initiative. This presumption can be rebutted if the platform proves that the contractual relationship is not an employment relationship,” it adds.

The agreement also contains transparency provisions that will require platforms to provide information to individuals performing platform work (and to their representatives) about how the algorithms that manage them work; and how their behaviour affects decisions taken by automated systems.

That looks important because while the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) already provides some rights to data subjects subject to automated decision-making, to be provided with information about the logic used by such algorithms, it’s fair to say that gig workers who have tried to use the GDPR to extract meaningful insights on the algorithms used to manage (and even fire) them have had to resort to lengthy and frustrating court battles to try to extract useful data.

Worker data access rights advocacy organizations will be hoping the new directive makes it far harder for platforms to find excuses not to hand over workers’ data.

The provisionally agreed new rules will also ban platforms from taking “certain important decisions”, such as dismissals or decisions to suspend an account, without human oversight.

Similarly, the GDPR contains a right to human review of legal or significant decisions taken by automation — but, again, gig workers have had to take platforms to court to challenge them over so-called ‘robo-firings’. So having an explicit law that bans such practices should force platforms to reform their practices.

Per the parliament, the agreed text also ensures “more human oversight on the decisions of systems that directly affect the persons performing platform work”; and obliges platforms to “assess the impact of decisions taken or supported by automated monitoring and decision-making systems on working conditions, health and safety and fundamental rights”. So conducting data protection impact assessments looks set to be a hard requirement for complying with the new law.

Another prohibition that’s been agreed is a ban on platforms from processing certain types of personal data of workers, including personal beliefs, private exchanges with colleagues, or when a worker is not at work — with the Directive billed as beefing up data protection rights for platform workers.

During the press conference Gualmini also suggested the agreed text in the area on consent to data protection goes “beyond the limits of the GDPR”, dubbing that part of the deal “extremely innovative”.

Other provisions in the provisional deal include a requirement for platforms to share information on self-employed workers in their employ with competent national authorities and representatives of those performing platform work, such as trade unions.

Measures to prevent platforms from circumventing the rules by using intermediaries has also been agreement — a practice that’s stepped up considerably in Spain since the country introduced its own labor reform, back in 2021, with the aim of forcing platforms to hire delivery workers.

“Member states will have to make sure that persons performing platform work working through intermediaries enjoy the same level of protection as those with a direct contractual relationship,” the parliament said on that.

Some key details of exactly what’s been agreed remain under wraps — and full visibility and analysis of the ramifications will likely have to wait for a consolidated text to emerge in the coming weeks/months.

To wit: Dragoş Pîslaru, chair of the Employment and Social Affairs committee, rebuffed a journalist’s question asking what the five “indicators” the co-legislators have agreed may be used to trigger a process that could lead to the reclassification of platform workers as employees — saying they could not go into the “exact details” of what is in the provision text agreed last night at this point. So how easy (or otherwise) it might be for to trigger reclassifications of platform workers is still unclear.

As the law is a directive, not a regulation, there will also be scope for some variation across Member States, depending on how they choose to implement it — but the idea for the pan-EU law is to set a minimum standard, leaving countries free to pass rules that further raise protections for workers.

The final text still needs to be voted on by the Council and Parliament before it can be adopted as pan-EU law. What implementation period has been agreed also isn’t yet clear. But today’s political deal signals the train has now left the station.

“This really is a historic agreement,” added Gualmini. “I doubted that we’d be able to get to such a good compromise. Because we now have the possibility to look at what’s happening in this labour market, move the burden of proof, ensure that we don’t have these people being falsely deemed to be self employed and not leaving it up to those people to prove that they are not self employed but, rather, it being the platform that is responsible for demonstrating that that employee really is self employed.

“And so this is a real improvement for the social rights and labour rights of millions of workers. This is the kind of step that we’ve never seen before in Europe. Looking at the algorithms, improving transparency. Our text is incredibly ambitious. And I am really incredibly happy that we are now managing to provide protection [for gig workers]. Now of course we want to have competition — fair competition — between multinationals but we also want to protect workers who in this labour market should have the support that they deserve, should not be abused by these companies as often was the case in the past.”"

1146083765,20231213,"The Crown Dependencies have today (December 13) published a joint commitment to increase transparency and accessibility to information held on their registers of beneficial ownership.

The central registers of company beneficial ownership in Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man already exchange information with international law enforcement entities and tax authorities around the world. In line with the shared global aim of combatting financial crime in all its forms, access to the information will be extended to include:
• financial services business and certain other businesses (collectively described as obliged entities) who are required to conduct customer due diligence
• those media and civil society organisations who can demonstrate a legitimate interest in accessing the information in order to combat financial crime

The joint commitment follows careful consideration of recent decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights which recognise the incompatibility with public access with the right to privacy, and the recent international developments in response to this. (It therefore replaces the commitment published in June 2019).

The commitment states: “We have a longstanding and independently verified track record of meeting international standards. We are proud of our global leadership in tax cooperation, in combatting money laundering and in countering the financing of terrorism and proliferation financing. We will continue to provide appropriate and effective transparency which can support those critical objectives.”

The Crown Dependencies have already undertaken substantial preparatory work to enable obliged entity access, and it will be implemented before the end of 2024 in a manner that puts in place appropriate safeguards to effectively manage any interference with privacy rights.

Subject to necessary approvals in the Crown Dependencies’ legislatures, access for those with a legitimate interest will be provided in line with international obligations extended to the three islands, recognising that there is a crucial balance to strike between protecting human rights and combatting financial crime.

The Crown Dependencies will develop and deliver ‘legitimate interest’ access in a leading timeframe, taking into account international developments. Proposals to agree the definition of legitimate interest will be presented to the islands’ parliaments by Q4 of 2024 at the latest with implementation following in a reasonable timeframe afterwards."

The joint effort by the Government of Pakistan and Team Europe partners will allocate €179 million to tackle urgent water and sanitation service delivery challenges in Faisalabad and Lahore, while strengthening climate resilience, a news release said.

The collaborative initiative, entitled ‘Punjab Urban Water and Wastewater Governance and Services Improvement,’ spans six years and blends grant support from the EU and a soft loan from the AfD. The agreement has been signed by EU Ambassador Dr. Riina Kionka and Deputy Director AfD Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Asia, Ms. Julie Marsaudon, in the presence of German Ambassador Alfred Grannas and Italian Ambassador Andreas Ferrarese.

Acknowledging Punjab’s pivotal economic role in contributing 54% of Pakistan’s GDP, EU Ambassador Dr. Riina Kionka highlighted persistent water and sanitation challenges. She underscored the EU’s commitment to support Pakistan in improving resilience to climate change and the EU’s readiness to redouble efforts to support the country’s green inclusive growth, a priority under the EU Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan and also for EU assistance to the country.

She further discussed the EU’s role as the world’s leading contributor to international climate finance, emitting about 9% of greenhouse gases but contributing some 30% of global public financing.

The French Ambassador’s representative noted that the fight against climate change was a top priority for France. Since the Geneva Conference on a “Resilient Pakistan” on January 9, 2023, France has committed to strengthening its cooperation on climate change: today, some 97% of AFD financing also benefits the climate. The partnership with the EU on water and sanitation is an example of this priority; it will mobilise expertise towards climate-resilient solutions in the water and sanitation sectors.

The project aims to improve access to drinking water and sanitation services by installing 200 kilometres of new water supply pipes and providing 55,000 new connections. It focuses on enhancing capacities, increasing water treatment capacity by 135,000 cubic meters per day and bolstering urban water governance.

The initiative will improve the access of 400,000 individuals to drinking water. This joint intervention underscores the joint commitment of the Government of Pakistan and Team Europe to sustainable development, marking a crucial step towards building climate resilience and ensuring a better quality of life for people and businesses in Faisalabad and Lahore."

1146150102,20231213,"HUNGARY will block a proposal to start talks on European Union membership for Ukraine at a summit of the bloc’s leaders this week, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said today.

Mr Orban also said that admitting the war-ravaged country would have unforeseeable consequences for the EU.

EU leaders are expected to vote on whether to begin membership talks for Ukraine during a summit in Brussels that begins on Thursday but Mr Orban has insisted that he will block the proposal, which requires a unanimous decision by the leaders of all the bloc’s 27 countries.

Speaking to politicians in Hungary’s parliament today, Mr Orban said that the time for bringing Ukraine into the EU had “not yet come,” and that the development of a strategic partnership with Kiev should be a prerequisite for beginning membership talks.

“We are interested in a peaceful and prosperous Ukraine, but this requires the establishment of peace as quickly as possible, and a deliberate deepening of the strategic partnership,” Mr Orban said, adding that such a process could take “a number of years.”

“Everything has its appointed time, but the time for Ukraine’s membership in the European Union has not yet come,” he said.

Hungary has also signalled that it will veto a financial aid package for Kiev worth €50 billion (around £43bn)."

1146178098,20231214,"A volley of Russian missiles wounded dozens of people and damaged a children's hospital Wednesday, the worst attack on Kyiv in months, Ukrainian officials said, as the country pleads for Western military aid.

AFP journalists in the capital heard several explosions before dawn, and air raid sirens sounded soon after that.

Ukraine's air force said it had downed all 10 missiles targeting the city and the health ministry said 53 people had been wounded, including two children.

Most injuries were caused by ""glass shards, household items and the shock wave"" as missile debris fell in eastern and southern parts of the city, the ministry added.

Wednesday's strike, which caused the highest number of wounded in months, was the second in a week. In another attack overnight Sunday to Monday, eight missiles headed for the capital were shot down.

""The enemy used ballistic weapons,"" the Kyiv City Military Administration said, adding that Russia was ""intensifying the missile terror of Kyiv"".

There were also strikes in the southern port of Odesa, where officials said nine Iranian-made Shahed drones had been downed.

On the edge of the port city of Odesa, an AFP journalist saw a large hangar in which trucks and cars had been destroyed. Pieces of the metal roof were lodged in the branches of nearby trees.

Inside the hangar, some cars had shrapnel holes, some were burnt out, while others had been crushed by the roof falling. Some cars parked outside were also damaged.

""It turned out that when the drones were downed, not all of them were completely destroyed,"" said army spokeswoman Nataliya Gumenyuk.

She said the destroyed hangar was a civilian facility, not directly connected to Odesa ports, which has been relentlessly targeted by Moscow since summer.

Two employees of a car repair facility were wounded by one of the downed drones and ""a port infrastructure building was partially destroyed"" by another, regional chief Oleg Kiper said.

Russia's defence ministry said the armed forces had destroyed Ukrainian ammunition depots and drone construction sites, but did not elaborate.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Russia ""a shameful country that fires rockets at night, hitting residential areas, kindergartens and energy facilities in winter"".

The Kyiv strikes came a day after a massive hacking attack on the country's top telecoms operator, which Ukrainian officials said might have been carried out by Russian security services.

Russian forces have also intensified attacks along the front line in southern and eastern Ukraine in recent days.

The missiles targeted Kyiv when Zelenskyy was traveling to Norway -- a key donor -- after a visit to Washington that failed to unblock a $60-billion aid package stuck in a divided Congress.

The Ukrainian leader is trying to rebuild support among Ukraine's allies amid growing fatigue. Ukraine ""can't win without help"", he told reporters following talks with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.

Speaking alongside Zelenskyy at the White House on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said: ""I will not walk away from Ukraine."" A Ukrainian defeat would mean ""would-be aggressors everywhere will be emboldened"", he warned.

The conflict is expected to be a key topic for a European Union summit this week, where Ukraine is hoping for positive news on its bid for membership.

Speaking in the European Parliament on Wednesday, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen urged the bloc's 27 leaders to back massive financial aid for Ukraine, and Kyiv's ambitions for membership talks. ""We must give Ukraine what it needs to be strong today,"" the European Commission president told MEPs.

French President Emmanuel Macron also called for the EU to offer ""full and enduring support"" to Ukraine. ""Our collective security is at stake,"" he said.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he would call for ""sustainable, reliable financial support for Ukraine"" at the summit.

But Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban maintains his opposition to opening EU membership talks with Ukraine, suggesting instead a ""strategic partnership""."

1146200957,20231214,"NEW YORK, NY (IANS) – Accepting the Power of One Award from Diwali Foundation USA, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the global organization is indispensable at a time when crises are tearing the world apart.

After receiving the award on December 12, he said that crises in the Middle East and Ukraine have kept nations and people apart and hindered global cooperation and progress.

“But it is exactly at times such as these that the work of the US is indispensable.”

The UN’s “pursuit of peace, human rights, and sustainable development exemplifies the values and principles that we should all espouse to replicate”, he added.

Ravi Batra, chair of the National Advisory Council on South Asian Affairs, giving the citation for Ban, said that he was “a man of history embedded in the Republic of Korea’s top political power, but he gave it all up to become a global champion. of peace and security and to better deliver justice to all”.

“His singular achievement is the Paris Agreement” on climate change, Batra said.

Ban, who was the Secretary-General from 2007 to 2016, received the award from Ranju Batra, the chair of Diwali Foundation USA.

Now Ban is the deputy chair of The Elders, a group of former world leaders founded by the late South African President Nelson Mandela to work for human rights and a sustainable planet.

The Power of One Award recognizes the singular achievements of diplomats in bringing about positive change.

Sri Lanka’s Permanent Representative Mohan Pieris, who spoke at the awards ceremony, described the awards as the “Oscars of Diplomacy”, a comparison to the popular movie awards in the US.

The others who received the awards on Monday were Miroslav Lajcak, a former president of the General Assembly; and former Permanent Representatives Mirsada Colakovic of Bosnia and Kim Sook of South Korea.

The diplomats representing an array of religions who spoke at the event touched on the relevance of Diwali to the contemporary world and its significance that transcends religions.

India’s Permanent Representative Ruchira Kamboj said that the festival “is a sentiment that embodies the triumph of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance and hope over despair”.

Paula Narvaez Ojeda, the president of the UN Economic and Social Council, said that amid all the problems that the world faces, Diwali embodies hope, “a universal and powerful moral message”.

Olof Skoog, who heads the European Union delegation to the UN and moderated the event, said: “Our session today is very much about turning the best of intentions into real change, light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance.”

The event was co-sponsored by over 60 countries, including the US.

Both Israel and the Palestine Authority also joined in co-sponsoring it."

Ambassador of the European Union to Nigeria, Samuela Isopi, stated this Wednesday during her visit to Governor Abdullahi Sule in Lafia, the state capital.

The ambassador said she was moved by what she has seen in Nasarawa state, being honoured by the hospitality of the government and people of the state.

She said the state plays a key role in the Nigerian polity and the European Union is keen on exploring areas of collaboration in democratic governance, climate change as well as peace and security.

Apart from noting the aspect of social cohesion and inter-faith dialogue as some of the key areas the European Union is working on, the envoy also stated the need for enhanced economic ties, education, agriculture, green energy, rural electrification and innovation with Nasarawa state.

Appreciating her choice of Nasarawa state for the visit, Governor Sule acknowledged the mutual interest shared between Nigeria and the European Union, saying his administration is poised to ensure such a relationship blossoms.

Sule also said the state government was committed to interfaith harmony and it would welcome any initiative that would promote same.

The governor noted the support of the European Union in promoting peace, security and clean energy among other economically viable areas. He called for enhanced collaboration in agriculture, vocational education and inter-faith.

Sule said Nasarawa state was open to investment in agriculture, clean energy, oil and gas as well as solid mineral development with particular emphasis on lithium."

1146252555,20231214,"European Union leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day meeting to finalise further support for Ukraine. In the corridors of Brussels, diplomats and officials feel that what’s at stake here is both the vital financial and moral support for Kyiv and the very unity of the EU.

At the last European Council meeting of this year, EU leaders will decide whether to approve a 50 billion-euro financial support fund for Ukraine over the next four years. Kyiv needs the money to keep the country functioning: to pay pensions, maintain schools, run hospitals, and repair roads.

The second decision concerns EU enlargement. Leaders will decide whether to allow Ukraine to start EU accession negotiations later this year. Moldova, which wants to join the community, is also awaiting a positive decision, while Georgia hopes to be granted candidate status.

“The decisions taken this week will be the most important and will determine the future of the EU,” said Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Both senior EU officials and national leaderships admit that the EU cannot find consensus on any issue and that everything will be decided at the eleventh hour, at the negotiating table in Brussels. At this table, countries will try to persuade essentially their only opponent, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

“The biggest question is how serious Hungary is about going all the way with its position, whether it is a serious threat or just a bluff. Or maybe a combination of both?” said Marija Martišiūtė, an analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Centre.

It is therefore possible that the summit will extend into the weekend.

Many in Europe are calling this European Council summit historical, because if Ukraine is not allowed to start formal negotiations, not will Moldova, and Georgia is unlikely to be granted candidate status.

“These decisions are about the future of Europe, not just about Ukraine’s membership of NATO or the EU. These are decisions that will determine what kind of Europe we will all live in and whether it will be a secure Europe. The stakes are high. Therefore, I hope that we will find diplomatic ways to prevent Orbán from blocking the whole of the European Council, because the moment of EU enlargement is important for the future of all of us,” Jamie Shea, a former NATO official, professor and expert at Friends of Europe, a political analysis centre in Brussels, told LRT.lt.

Both measures require unanimous consent – so all EU countries must agree on both the 50-billion-euro fund for Ukraine and the opening of accession negotiations. However, while the Community is being held hostage by Hungary on the negotiations, the EU has other tools at its disposal to get the money for Ukraine.

Behind the scenes in Brussels, there is talk that Budapest may be willing to make concessions on money for Ukraine in exchange for the European Commission transferring billions that have been frozen for several years. The EC has withheld the money from Budapest for various issues with the rule of law, failure to guarantee the independence of the judiciary, etc.

While both the European Parliament and most capitals have urged the EC to take a principled approach and not to be blackmailed by Budapest, the Commission announced on Wednesday evening that it was releasing part of the money, around 10 out of some 30 billion euros. The Commission justified the decision by saying Budapest had implemented reforms for the independence of the judiciary, but the move was still criticised as pandering to Hungary.

Martišiūtė, an analyst working in Brussels, believes that this can be seen as picking a lesser evil.

“In principle, I completely agree that the EU should not be blackmailed by Hungary. [...] But if Orbán sticks to his position to the end, this is a decisive moment and the EU may have to move to a compromise position. One of them is to agree to review how Hungary has progressed on certain reforms and if indeed some of the reforms have been implemented, some progress has been made, perhaps some of the money can be freed.

“Of course, it is inevitable that the media will immediately say the EU has succumbed to blackmail. But the EU has also recently freed up some money for Poland, so if Hungary is indeed pursuing reforms, the Commission must take this into account,” she told LRT.lt.

However, some capitals see this as a surrender and speak of a serious threat to the reputation of EC President Ursula von der Leyen and her ambitions to be re-elected for a second term.

“Imagine a scenario where the EC frees up money for Hungary and Orbán still blocks all decisions, including money for Ukraine. That would be a complete disaster for von der Leyen and a complete fiasco for Europe,” said one official who did not want to be named.

If Orbán does not back down, countries have alternatives to maintain at least financial support for Ukraine.

“A coalition of the willing can be formed. Say, 26 countries could step in and commit money to the fund without Hungary, thus bypassing Hungary’s veto. But this would send a message of division in the EU,” said Martišiūtė.

According to LRT’s sources, the capitals are seriously considering such a plan B, but all possible efforts will be made to avoid it. In any case, the EU is trying to resolve at least the issue of financial support, so as not to send a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the community is split.

However, Martišiūtė argues that in such a tense situation, with vital support for Ukraine hanging in the balance, this could be a good alternative: “I think we should not be obsessed with the idea of unity if we see that one member of the EU family is threatening it all.”

Even if Orbán can make concessions on financial support in exchange for money for his own country, agreeing to allow Ukraine to start EU accession negotiations is his red line. However, he is not opposed to Moldova starting accession talks and Georgia getting candidate status.

“This only proves that he is principled against Ukraine in particular and his stubbornness could easily sacrifice the interests of Moldova and Georgia,” said one diplomat.

According to him, some countries will certainly not accept green-lighting solutions only for Moldova and Georgia, leaving Ukraine with nothing.

The decisions of this Council are therefore truly fundamental: either the Hungarians will be won over and the EU will take historic steps towards enlargement, or the community will miss the chance and all the potential joiners will remain outside the EU indefinitely.

Orbán explains his position by saying that the EU is not ready to accept Ukraine and instead asks for a strategic discussion on the effectiveness of the EU’s support for Ukraine and only next year, in March, taking up the question of opening formal negotiations.

However, Hungary is well aware that it is the decision of this Council that is of the utmost moral importance for Ukraine, because all the parties are aware that the accession process itself, even if the opening of the negotiations is blessed, will be very long, difficult and viscous, with Ukraine needing to implement a series of reforms in 35 areas, and with all the parties having to bless the progress made by Ukraine once again.

In Brussels, there is talk that Orbán’s desire to block Ukraine’s membership issue at this particular summit may be linked to collusion with the Kremlin. Russian President Putin, who has announced his candidacy for re-election, is keen to maintain the widest possible support among his compatriots and show how divided the EU is.

If this week’s European Council fails to reach agreements on any of the issues, it is possible that the 26 EU countries will consider triggering the so-called Article 7 procedure against Hungary. This means that countries can suspend Hungary’s right to vote in the EU if it is found to be in repeated breach of EU values.

This is not the first time such a measure has been discussed for Hungary, but it has not been taken, partly because Poland had consistently shielded Hungary.

Martišiūtė agrees that such a scenario is possible, but it would be, as she puts it, “nuclear”: “Nobody wants that to happen, but I think the EU should not rule it out, if it is really necessary.”

Shea, the expert at Friends of Europe, says he is not a “catastrophist” and believes that, if not this time, the EU will be able to reach an agreement on the Ukraine talks starting in March.

“Let’s hope for a productive negotiation in this European Council, because I believe there is no alternative to EU enlargement. If we leave these countries, only Mr Putin will benefit, not us. The instability in that grey area with the absence of the rule of law, corruption, etc, the insecurity, the hybrid warfare, will eventually penetrate into the European Union itself.

“So we have a situation where we are either going forward or we are going backwards. Therefore, perhaps there will be a few more chaotic summits, perhaps a few too many long night meetings of the heads of state. But it is very important that in the end the majority opinion prevails in this case,” said Shea.

It is not the first time that Hungary is presenting a major problem for the EU to take important decisions. It was Budapest that was the most resistant last year when the community was considering an embargo on Russian oil, and this year the country has been vetoing a 500-million-euro military aid package since spring. But Hungary is not the only obstacle. Many diplomats are already saying loudly that the West, and therefore the EU, is tired of war.

Shea, who has also worked for NATO for many years, told LRT.lt that aid is clearly faltering.

“First, the EU has problems with the so-called European Peace Facility. Both the promise to buy and provide Ukraine with 155 mm artillery shells [the EU had promised to provide one million of these shells by March next year – LRT.lt] and the possibility of reimbursing the costs incurred for sending weapons to Ukraine. So we have to admit that this is not the best moment for Ukraine in terms of financial and political support,” he said.

However, he suggests taking a broader view and not forgetting bilateral support not only from the EU but also from NATO countries: “The Dutch have already pledged 2.5 billion euros, Germany has said it will double it next year to 8 billion. The UK has signed an arms consortium with Norway. So things are happening and we need to look at the bigger picture – Ukraine is still getting both money and arms.”

“Now EU leaders need to step forward and convince their societies that this is not just charity for Ukraine. This is a fundamental decision for the security of the whole of Europe,” said Shea."

1146278863,20221214,"An aid cutoff would follow a similar move by Germany last month.

The Swiss National Council voted on Tuesday to cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) amid mounting international concerns over the group’s activities in Gaza.

The decision by the lower house of the Swiss Federal Assembly, which needs to be approved in the upper chamber, the Council of States, comes amid a groundswell of reports of terror ties among UNRWA officials following the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. These include an eyewitness account of an UNRWA schoolteacher holding one of the Israeli hostages in the basement of his Gaza home and the discovery of missiles and other weapons hidden among UNRWA relief supplies.

The complete funding cut, which would follow a similar move by Germany last month, was condemned by UNRWA. The agency voiced the hope that the decision will be amended in the follow-up vote in the Council of States next week.

“Disheartened by Switzerland Parliament’s national council move to cut aid to UNRWA, as the agency is recognized as a major humanitarian actor in Gaza and the region,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini, who is a Swiss national, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Switzerland is UNRWA’s ninth-largest donor nation, contributing more than $21 million in funding in 2023.

The Swiss government previously voiced concerns that UNRWA glorified terrorism against Israel and took a one-sided position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, views that were amplified by the current war against Hamas in Gaza.

Over the last two months, UNRWA has been pilloried for employing staff who celebrated the Oct. 7 massacre, deleting social-media posts that accused Palestinian terrorist groups of stealing humanitarian aid and otherwise colluding with Hamas.

“Israelis have been let down disastrously by the gaggle of international organizations that make Switzerland their home, and none more so than UNRWA, which taught hate every day to the Oct. 7 terrorists,” said Marcus Sheff, CEO of IMPACT-se, an Israeli NGO that monitors school textbooks and curricula for compliance with UNESCO-defined standards on peace and tolerance.

Amid decades of reports of hate and terror indoctrination, the Trump administration cut off U.S. funding to UNRWA in 2018, a move President Joe Biden reversed shortly after taking office in 2021.

This summer, the U.S. State Department allocated more than $200 million for UNRWA despite its schools’ curriculum glorifying violence and terrorism, and an agreement conditioning funding on the prevention of teaching hate and antisemitism.

The new funding brought the total United States assistance to UNRWA during the Biden administration to more than $600 million, cementing the United States’ status as UNRWA’s largest donor, according to the White House.

The European Union gave the agency $114 million last year, while Germany allocated $200 million.

Last month, Germany announced a freeze on all UNRWA aid to Gaza, ending a review of all Palestinian aid in the wake of the revelations about UNRWA that came out during the war.

Last week, a leader of the Knesset’s Christian Allies Caucus told European lawmakers in Brussels that UNRWA needs to be dismantled because it has become an accomplice to Palestinian terrorism.

“The most deeply engrained institution in Gaza—that allows for the indoctrination of Gaza youth, so that some of them eventually grew up to join Hamas, becoming the terrorists who raped women, beheaded men and took babies as hostages—is an international institution, which your governments fund,” Knesset member Sharren Haskel (National Unity) said in a keynote address to lawmakers at the European Parliament in Brussels.

UNRWA, which the U.N. established in 1949 to carry out relief and work programs for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled their homes during the 1948 War of Independence, defines refugees not only as refugees themselves but also their descendants in perpetuity. As a consequence, the number of Palestinian refugees registered with the organization has mushroomed from 750,000 in 1950 to nearly six million today.

The main UN refugee agency, UNHCR, which cares for the rest of the refugees in the world, has no such policy.

Israel has long said that UNRWA should be abolished and its responsibilities taken over by UNHCR."

1146309014,20231214,"Meta will begin testing a system that allows posts from its microblogging platform Threads to appear on other social media services, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday.

The announcement, which had been eagerly anticipated by some technologists, is a significant step for both Meta and what is often called the fediverse, a loose collection of social networks that allow data to flow freely among them, similar to how email works.

“Making Threads interoperable will give people more choice over how they interact and it will help content reach more people,” Zuckerberg wrote in a Threads post. “I’m pretty optimistic about this.”

Before Wednesday, the fediverse was mostly composed of smaller, community-run social media services such as Mastodon, a Twitter-like platform. Mastodon uses guideline code called ActivityPub, an all-volunteer project that has been operational since 2017 and is by far the most popular format among fediverse proponents.

Threads will also use ActivityPub, adding a significant boost to that project and introducing the biggest player yet to the scene. A handful of other sites also already allow ActivityPub integration, including the blogging site Wordpress.com and the content curation site Flipboard.

“Threads is really the biggest commercial network that has connected to this universe by far,” said Evan Prodromou, an ActivityPub co-author. “It’s really exciting. My guess is that this is going to be a gradual process, that they’re going to be doing this over weeks and months. It’s not going to be all today.”

The fediverse is still tiny compared to Threads, with about 11 million users, the vast majority of them on Mastodon. While Meta has not yet broken out Threads users in its public filings, Zuckerberg said the platform reached 100 million users in its first five days in July. That growth appears to have since cooled, and data from December has shown its activity has dropped off somewhat.

But there is growth on the horizon. Zuckerberg said Thursday that Threads would open to more European countries. That announcement comes as X, formerly Twitter, faces potential legal fallout in Europe, which has much stricter rules for large social media platforms than the United States. In October, European Union regulators said they’re investigating X for allegedly being a hub of disinformation surrounding the Israel-Hamas war. On Thursday, a European activist sued X, alleging it violated E.U. privacy laws.

Zuckerberg described the integration with ActivityPub as “a test” but didn’t offer a clear timeline for the integration. Meta didn’t respond to a request for clarification.

Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, wrote on Threads that the platform is starting with the ability to follow Threads users from other ActivityPub platforms, adding that the ability for Threads users to follow accounts from other platforms is in the works.

If Threads goes through with full ActivityPub integration, people will be able to follow Threads users and see their posts without having to join the platform (Threads currently forces users to sign up through an Instagram account). Similarly, Threads users will be able to follow users and see posts from across ActivityPub’s network.

“The network effect for ActivityPub is gaining some serious momentum right now,” Mike McCue, co-founder and CEO of the newsreader Flipboard, posted on Threads. “As more services adopt the protocol, more people, more communities and more content are added to the network making it increasingly more valuable for everyone. This will only accelerate in the coming months as Threads, Wordpress, Tumblr, Flipboard and others federate.”

A widespread fediverse would still likely face significant challenges in large part due to its decentralized nature. Moderation becomes much more complicated among platforms, and disinformation and misinformation will likely be hard to tackle. Mozilla, the tech-focused nonprofit group behind the Firefox web browser, has already launched an effort to see what content moderation could look like in the fediverse.

Christine Lemmer-Webber, an ActivityPub co-author and co-editor, said she was excited about Threads joining the fediverse but had reservations about a tech giant suddenly dominating the technology. Meta, because of its size, could start dictating how the network operates.

In such a scenario, Meta would “come in, hook up to the system, and then say, ‘Well, we’re the biggest player really. Actually you all have to do it our way or the highway,’” she said."

Organised by the United Nations to build international consensus on how to tackle climate change, this was the first year that the conference planned to have a global stocktake to account for how far countries have progressed in achieving targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

There was confusion and surprise in the plenary and overflow rooms, as well as for participants attending virtually, when the COP28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, passed the global stocktake text in five minutes on December 13. This was almost 24 hours after proceedings had ended, without any room for further discussion. Island nations such as Samoa had planned to add their comments to the text, but never got a chance.

Importantly, negotiations had stalled after a tense faceoff between developing countries on whether to use the terms “fossil fuel phase out” or “fossil fuel phase down”. They also butted heads on climate finance and the role of historic emissions to keep to the scientific goal of 1.5 degrees.

The final UAE consensus said coal should be “phased down” and not “phased out”, which will allow countries like China and India to continue to expand their carbon emissions via coal. In August, India cut its rate of increase in carbon emissions by a third since 2014. But it remains the fourth largest emitter in the world and is silent on coal production, which continues to expand.

At the proceedings in Dubai, India reiterated its demand for common but differentiated responsibilities, which would give it more breathing room to continue on its high energy development trajectory. During the head of delegations meeting on December 11, both India and China opposed any text that was too prescriptive for developing countries while continuing to emphasise on the responsibility of historical emitters like the United States of America and Europe to keep the rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees above normal.

This rejection of the phasing out of fossil fuels is devastating, said a group of small island countries that are likely to disappear if global temperature increase is not capped at 1.5 degrees above normal and if sea levels continue to rise.

“I’ll be brief but I’ll speak from the heart,” said a Marshall Islands representative during a closed meeting of selected countries called Majlis or “council” on December 10. “Our national adaptation plan envisions that by 2040 if nothing is done then then the Marshall Islands will be forced to let go of some of our islands and relocate to other islands, abandoning their home, cultures, and the bones of their ancestors. The issues are clear here.”

India itself has been reeling from extreme weather events that have been linked to changing climatic patterns impact vulnerable groups the most.

Over the years, India’s position at succeeding COPs has evolved from a stance that sought more accountability from developed countries such as the US and those in the European Union, to one more aligned with the ‘like-minded developing countries’ bloc of parties in deferring the phase-out of fossil fuels and accountability to a later date.

This year, India built on its stand of “vasudhaiva kutumbakam” to build “one earth, one family and one future”, which it first emphasised when it hosted the G20 summit in Delhi this year.

“The way ahead must be based on equity and climate justice,” said Bhupender Yadav, minister of environment, forests and climate change at the closing plenary session on December 13. “Let us implement the Paris Agreement in letter and spirit through the global stocktake process.”

Dr Florentine Koppenborg, an observer to the negotiations from the Technical University of Munich, said, “It has been 31 years since the adoption of the UNFCCC Rio Conference and, for the first time, the international community agreed to include language on fossil fuels in a climate treaty. In that sense, the phrase ‘transitioning away from fossil fuels’ is historic. The world has taken a first step towards moving beyond the fossil fuel age, but the adopted language is weak, which means many more steps are required.”

This is even as India continues to push for unabated expansion of coal production and use as it seeks to build its energy capacities: in 2023, Coal India Limited, India’s largest state-run coal producer, announced that it aimed to expand its production of thermal energy from 893 million tonnes in 2022-23 to 1 billion tonnes per year by 2024-25.

The final text of the COP28 agreement emphasises the need for “sustainable and just solutions to the climate crisis” that are founded on the “participation of all stakeholders”.

But India’s ambitions to expand coal come at grave cost to its own people.

1146324049,20231214,"BEIRUT, TRIPOLI — Smoking his way through a pack of cigarettes in a Beirut cafe, 22-year-old Salah Abrush calls his friend, Feras, who arrived in Germany in September. When he hangs up, Salah leans back in his chair. A hopeful smile stretches across his face. “They’ll help you in Germany,” he says, “not like here in Lebanon.”

Feras—who, like Salah, is Syrian—paid a trafficker $8,000 this past July to take him on a flight from Lebanon to Tunisia, followed by a 22-hour boat ride to Italy and finally a nearly month-long walk from Italy, through Switzerland, to Germany.

Six months later, Feras is settled in the western German city of Cologne, where he is waiting for his asylum application to be processed. Hearing about his success has left Salah eager to attempt a similar journey himself.

Salah says his life in Lebanon has become unbearable. He was a child when his family came here from Aleppo in 2009, before the war, and stayed as conditions in Syria worsened. After 2011, as 1.5 million Syrian refugees streamed into the country, his life in Lebanon grew increasingly difficult. Most of his family has returned to Syria, but he does not want to go back, fearing punishment for evading Syria’s mandatory military service. His options for what to do next are slim, and all are dangerous.

“It’s getting more dangerous for Syrians in Lebanon. We are hated here,” Salah says. He reaches up to touch the top of his head, running his fingers over a large lump that has formed. On November 10, a group of armed Lebanese men approached Salah and demanded he give them his moped, he says. When he refused, one of them hit him with a large metal rod, cracking his skull and causing a brain hemorrhage that left him near death.

A picture of the injury provided to Syria Direct shows a large gash running across the top of Salah’s head. He was taken to the hospital, where doctors told him he should stay overnight. But the stay would cost $1,500 without insurance, so he checked himself out after a few hours, with no choice but to heal at home.

Violence against Syrian refugees in Lebanon is on the rise, stoked by provocative media campaigns organized by the country’s politicians, who blame Syrians for the country’s country’s ongoing economic crisis. Meanwhile, the Lebanese army has been carrying out an unprecedented wave of arrests and deportations of Syrian refugees.

Salah never attempted to press charges for the attack. His residency papers are expired, and if he went to the police he felt he would “definitely” be deported to Syria—an outcome he was not willing to risk.

Just about a month before he was nearly killed, Salah and five Syrian coworkers were let go from their jobs at Spinneys, a supermarket in Beirut’s upscale Achrafieh neighborhood. Salah said he was told the supermarket was closing, but when he returned to pick up his salary, he found it open and running, just without Syrian staff.

Now, Salah is sure he will leave Lebanon. “I don’t have another option,” he says. “Here, I’m 100 percent sure I won’t have a future. I won’t have kids. I won’t marry. I can’t do anything.”

With attention south, more Syrians leave from the north

With pressure mounting on Syrian refugees—and all eyes on increasing violence between Hezbollah and Israel in the country’s south—increasing numbers of Syrians are attempting a dangerous passage by sea to Europe, departing from Lebanon’s northern shores.

The first two months after the start of the war in Gaza have seen significantly higher numbers of people departing by boat from Lebanon than the same period last year, according to verified figures UNHCR Lebanon spokesperson Lisa Abou Khaled provided to Syria Direct. The vast majority of those attempting to leave are Syrians.

In October 2023, UNHCR verified the departure of nine boats carrying 598 passengers. Seven of the vessels successfully reached the shores of Cyprus, Lebanon’s Mediterranean neighbor. In October 2022, there were only two confirmed boats, carrying 67 passengers, and none were bound for Cyprus.

In November, eight boats carrying 327 passengers left Lebanon. Three arrived successfully, while four were returned. By comparison, November 2022 saw only four boat movements, carrying 137 passengers, and one successful landing on Cyprus.

“When everyone was focused on Gaza, more boats were likely leaving Lebanon,” Ibrahim Jouhari, a migration researcher and co-author of a 2023 Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF) paper on irregular maritime maritime migration trends from Lebanon, told Syria Direct. “No one has the bandwidth to focus on this when the south [of Lebanon] is burning,” he said.

Before Lebanon’s economic crisis took hold in 2019, few people tried to migrate from Lebanon by sea. However, since then there has been a “significant yearly increase in the number of both ships and individuals attempting to migrate from Lebanon’s shores,” according to the FNF paper.

In late October as the war in Gaza—and escalation between Hezbollah and Israel in southern Lebanon—intensified, Cypriot authorities announced they were bracing for a larger influx of asylum seekers from Lebanon. The announcement came soon after they received boats from Lebanon carrying 458 Syrian passengers in the course of a single week.

The director of Caritas Cyprus, Elizabeth Kassinis, told Syria Direct that, according to figures announced by authorities, the number of Syrians arriving in Cyprus has “nearly doubled” since the start of October.

UNHCR in Cyprus processed 761 asylum applications submitted by Syrian nationals in October 2023, compared to just 370 the same month in 2022, according to UNHCR Cyprus figures sent to Syria Direct.

Ibrahim al-Aloun, a 23-year-old originally from Syria’s northwestern Idlib province, attempted to leave Lebanon by boat nearly a year ago. He, his wife Ghadia and their five-month-old son departed from Lebanon’s northern coast late last December, hoping to arrive in Italy and then head on to Germany, he told Syria Direct from Tripoli.

Ibrahim and his family were among 4,334 people who attempted to informally immigrate by boat from Lebanon’s shores in 2022—176 percent more than the 1,570 people who made similar attempts in 2021. In 2023, the numbers remain high, with 3,158 passengers attempting to depart by boat as of November, according to UNHCR Lebanon.

“The continuous economic collapse is affecting Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians,” Jouhari said. “The crackdown on Syrians has caused fear within their community, likely pushing more Syrians to seek passage by boat.”

The total number of Syrians arriving in Europe via Greece or Cyprus is up 40 percent in 2023, Jouhari added, according to his analysis of Frontex data through October. The figures do not indicate where they departed from, but he noted that most migrants taking this route leave from Lebanon or Syria. Given strict Russian patrols of Syria’s shores surrounding its naval base in Tartous, “all indications point towards departure from Lebanon’s northern shores,” Jouhari said.

Lebanon is “increasingly becoming a transit country,” he added.

Ibrahim and his family embarked on a different route last year, heading straight for Italy to avoid Cypriot migrant patrols. In 2020, Cyprus and Lebanon signed a migration deal allowing Cyprus to return migrants back to Lebanon. In August 2022 alone, Cyprus returned over 100 Syrian nationals who had arrived by boat, without screening them for legal protection.

Ibrahim paid an exorbitant $12,000 for the journey for himself, his wife, and young child, giving the money to a trafficker before they departed. They were supposed to leave in July, but the trip was pushed back to December 31, the winter storms bringing much rougher seas than in the summer months.

When Ibrahim and his family arrived at the port in Der Amar, about 10 kilometers north of Tripoli’s major port, it was “stormy and rainy” and the boat—promised to be a larger ship for the long journey—was a simple fisherman’s vessel.

“‘You either get in, or we will kill you,’” Ibrahim said the trafficker told him when he expressed doubts about wanting to board. Boats leaving from Lebanon are often too small, and ill-suited for long sea journeys.

Eight hours in, the boat began to sink, capsizing in the cold water and rough sea. Two months earlier, around 100 asylum seekers were killed in a similar incident, when their boat capsized after departing for Italy from Lebanon.

In April of the same year, 47 people were killed when, survivors said, a Lebanese navy boat struck their vessel en route to Cyprus, causing it to sink in what appeared to be the first fatal attempt to cross the 131 nautical miles (200 kilometers) between Tripoli and Cyprus.

When Ibrahim’s boat sank on January 1, a Syrian woman and child died. The other 232 people on board—Syrians, Lebanese and Palestinians—were rescued by the Lebanese navy.

But when the passengers on the boat realized they would be taken back to Lebanon, Ibrahim said, “they wanted to throw themselves into the sea.”

After barely surviving the sinking, Ibrahim, his wife and son were loaded onto trucks by the Lebanese army when they reached the shore—along with nearly 200 other Syrians who had also just been rescued—and taken across the border to Syria.

The army’s forced return of this group of Syrians, some of whom were registered with UNHCR, violated Lebanon’s non-refoulement obligations to not return anyone to countries where they face a risk of persecution or other serious human rights violations, Amnesty International reported at the time. It was far from the only forced return.

From the start of 2023 up until November 30, Lebanon has forcibly deported 761 Syrians and arbitrarily detained 1,027, most of whom were registered by UNHCR, according to numbers provided to Syria Direct by Mohammad Hasan, the executive director of the Access Center for Human Rights (ACHR), a human rights organization based in Beirut and Paris.

This is a marked increase from 2022, when just 159 Syrians were forcibly deported, and from 2021, when the army deported 59 Syrians. In October, ACHR documented three cases of forcible deportation and in November, 28 cases. Hasan noted that the true numbers could be higher than those reported.

The US government and European Union (EU) continue to fund the Lebanese army, seemingly with little pressure on Lebanon to stop deportations. On September 13, the US diverted $85 million in military aid from Egypt to Taiwan ($55 million) and Lebanon ($35 million) over Egypt’s “failure to make progress on human rights and other issues.” In January, the US also gave Lebanon $72 million for police and army wages for the first time.

For Ibrahim, the deportation was a nightmare, he said. He spent two days held by what he called a “Syrian gang.” During that time, he was able to call relatives and gather enough money to pay a $4,000 bribe for his family to be released and allowed to cross back into Lebanon.

Now back in Tripoli, Ibrahim lives in constant fear of being deported again. “If they catch me, they’ll send me back to Syria,” he said. He is also now thousands of dollars in debt, after losing the money he paid for a place on the capsized boat on top of the bribe paid in Syria.

Now unable to pay rent, Ibrahim, his wife and son—now one year old—have moved in with his brother. Staying in Syria was impossible. But “in Lebanon, I don’t have anything left,” he said. “Living here is awful. There is so much racism. I can’t do anything, and no one is helping us.”

‘I want to see the world’

Back at the Beirut cafe, Salah scrolls through messages from his friend in Germany, Feras. “He said the journey was easy,” he says hopefully.

Salah has tracked down a trafficker who said he would take $6,000 for a trip on a boat from Morocco to Italy, and then to Germany. He has heard he could take a flight from Lebanon to Libya, and continue on foot through Algeria to reach Morocco for only around $1,000.

It is a long and treacherous journey, but also Salah’s best chance to leave, he says. “You’ll die here [in Lebanon], or will die on your way out. So, I’ll go out.”

“The first thing I do when I leave is to continue my education,” Salah says. “I’ll study and I’ll improve my English.” Pausing for a moment, he adds, “I’m still young. I want to see the world.”"

1146346493,20231214,"BRUSSELS — The European Union failed to agree Thursday on a 50 billion-euro ($54 billion) package in financial aid that Ukraine desperately needs to stay afloat, even as the bloc decided to open accession negotiations with the war-torn country.

The aid was vetoed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, delivering another tough blow to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after he failed this week to persuade U.S. lawmakers to approve an additional $61 billion for Ukraine, mainly to buy weapons from the U.S.

The start of accession talks was a momentous moment and stunning reversal for a country at war that had struggled to find the backing for its membership aspirations and long faced obstinate opposition from Orban.

Hungary’s leader decided not to veto the accession talks, but then blocked the aid package.

“I can inform you that 26 leaders agreed on the (budget negotiation),” European Council President Charles Michel said. “I should be very precise. One leader, Sweden, needs to consult its parliament, which is in line with the usual procedure for this country, and one leader couldn’t agree.”

The decisions required unanimity among the EU’s members.

Still, Michel, who was chairing the Brussels summit, called the start of accession talks “a clear signal of hope for their people and our continent.”

Although the process between opening negotiations and Ukraine finally becoming a member could take many years, Zelensky welcomed the agreement as “a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe.”

“History is made by those who don’t get tired of fighting for freedom,” Zelensky said.

The financial package could not be endorsed after Orban vetoed both the extra money and a review of the EU budget. Ukraine is badly counting on the funds to help its damaged economy survive in the coming year.

Michel said leaders would reconvene in January in an effort to break the deadlock.

Orban had warned before the summit that forcing a decision on the Ukraine issues could destroy EU unity. Decisions on enlarging the EU and on a review of its long-term budget, which contains the 50 billion euros ($54.1 billion) in aid for the government in Kyiv, must be unanimous among all 27 member countries.

Orban had also threatened to veto the start of accession talks but ultimately backpedaled.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called the opening of membership discussions a black eye for Russian President Vladimir Putin. “It is a very clear message to Moscow. Us Europeans, we don’t let go of Ukraine,” he said.

Orban said that his opposition remained steadfast, but that he decided not to use his veto because the 26 other nations were arguing so strongly in favor. Under EU rules, an abstention does not prevent a decision from being adopted.

An EU official, who insisted on not being quoted by name because the summit negotiations were private, said Orban was “momentarily absent from the room in a pre-agreed and constructive manner” when the decision was made.

Orban said he stepped aside since all of his counterparts were committed to putting Ukraine on the EU membership path, though their position did not change his mind.

“Hungary’s perspective is clear: Ukraine is not ready for us to begin negotiations on its EU membership. It’s a completely illogical, irrational and improper decision” he said.

Others lauded Orban’s gesture. They had been preparing for the summit spilling over into an extra day Saturday.

“Certainly quicker than any of us expected,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said.

“In fairness to Prime Minister Orban, he made his case, made it very strongly. He disagrees with this decision and he’s not changing his opinion in that sense, but essentially decided not to use the veto power,” Varadkar said.

“I respect the fact that he he didn’t do that, because it would have put us in a very difficult position as a European Union,” the Irish leader added.

Belgium’s De Croo had a slightly different take, saying he thought Orban “didn’t use his veto because he realized that it would be indefensible.”

At the same time as Ukraine, the EU leaders also decided to open membership negotiations with Ukraine’s neighbor Moldova.

In the United States, national security adviser Jake Sullivan welcomed “the EU’s historic decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, a crucial step toward fulfilling their Euro-Atlantic aspirations.”

In Kyiv, the news was met with cautious optimism.

“We are Europe. Ukraine is Europe, the center of Europe. I want us to be given the status of a proud member of Europe,” said Olha Paradovska, a 70-year-old Kyiv resident.

Ivan Olezhko, 19, said the decision to start accession talks was long overdue. “If everything goes well, I will be happy, but we don’t know what will happen next,” he said.

EU leaders had expected the summit to take at least until late Friday before any sort of breakthrough might be clinched, so the fateful announcement came totally unexpectedly after Orban did not block the move by his colleagues.

A beaming Michel came down in the summit media room unscheduled and said “This is a historic moment, and it shows the credibility of the European Union. The strength of the European Union. The decision is made.”

He said the negotiations would open before a report will be made to the leaders in March.

The surprise came at a dire time for Zelensky, straight off a trip this week to Washington where his pleas for more aid from the U.S. Congress fell on deaf ears. Ukraine’s president was looking for a better response in Brussels.

“It is just as important that Ukraine has the means to continue the war and rebuild its country,” De Croo said.

The urgency to find a solution is matched only by the potential blow to the EU’s credibility, the Ukrainian president said in a video address to the leaders assembled in Brussels.

“Nobody wants Europe to be seen as untrustworthy. Or as unable to take decisions it prepared itself,” he said."
1146346501,20231214,"A husband and wife duo have brought their passion for healthy lifestyles and helping others reach their goals to Cherokee. Garrett and Vicki Hill opened their joint businesses FUeL and UpperCuts Salon this past summer at 228 W. Main Street in Cherokee.

Garrett, an Aurelia native, graduated from Aurelia High School in 2005 and attended Buena Vista University. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Human Performance and K-12 Physical Education from Buena Vista University, and after graduation, he interned at the University of Iowa’s Olympic Strength & Conditioning Department and Michael Johnson’s Performance Center in McKinney, Texas. For a time, he also taught in the Alta-Aurelia school district.

FUeL, which stands for “Function Under Exertion Lab,” was first opened in Alta in 2014. The business motto “where science meets performance” is still heartily embraced. FUeL is a specialty training facility that offers individual sessions, group sessions, clinic events, bundles, and more.

The gym’s mission statement is “training the body to exert force and function under ground-based, multi-joint exercises which promotes maximum benefits in injury prevention and explosive, powerful full range of motion movements.”

Garrett’s gym philosophy revolves around the idea that getting fit is more than just “throwing the iron around.” He explained that he wants to give his clients guidance and knowledge. “The more that you’re with me, the more knowledge you’ll get and the more you’ll just feel more confident.” FUeL’s website describes his approach as: “We want to help you move better with everyday movements, work on injury prevention, gain strength, knowledge, confidence, and create force production.”

In 2020 the couple moved to Aurora, Nebraska, where they reopened FUeL. For the next two-and-a-half years Garrett trained around 250 athletes of all ages. While back home visiting family for the fourth of July in 2023, the Hills noticed a building for sale on Main Street in Cherokee. Garrett reflected about the decision to move back to Cherokee County.

“We talked about it. You don’t see that kind of opportunity a lot, to say you have two family businesses and a tenant and you own the building. We were paying rent down there and it’s like, well do you want to take a chance? And she was all for it too.” Now, they are living closer to Garrett’s family and it’s something they appreciate, especially with their own young son Wenston.

Garrett is accredited through the National Strength and Conditioning Association and United States of America Weightlifting (USAW-2). He has a lot of experience working with college and professional athletes and enjoys working with youth. FUeL offers a program for 5-8 graders called “Junior FUeL Iron Squad” three mornings a week from 6:30 – 7:15 a.m. and two afternoons a week from 4-4:45 p.m. Another program is called “Iron Vixens” and is for women of any age.

Both businesses run on a personalized pricing model. Neither FUeL or UpperCuts list their prices online, except for special package deals that are available. “We want people to come in and talk to us,” explained Garrett. “It’s not a one-size fits all,” added Vicki. “I tell people it depends on what you need. I do have packages so the more you buy, the more you save. And I do run specials. But it depends what you add on for services.”

The gym operates on a bundle pricing basis, billed by calendar month. “It starts on the first and ends on the last day of the month,” explained Garrett. “The bundle pricing is an open lift and one-on-one sessions for say, an eight-pack. If you buy an eight-pack that means it’s an average of two times per week and you have to use it within the calendar month. It doesn’t carry over.”

“We do a free one-on-one consultation so if people are wanting more information they can come in and see what we’re all about. We don’t want you to come here and be like, this is totally different than what we anticipated.”

Veterans and current military receive a 20% discount, as well as current full-time police or fire department members. “We appreciate their service,” said Garrett. “We appreciate what they do for us and we are really excited to bring two businesses into the community that we believe offer some things that the community didn’t have when we got here.”

Vicki runs a holistic and clean approach salon. She not only offers beauty, detoxifying, and styling services, but she sells a variety of products that she uses in her shop that are “clean”.

You might ask yourself ‘what is clean and how is it different from organic?’

Clean products are those that do not have many of the chemicals you normally find in products made in the United States. There are strict guidelines in many other parts of the world compared to the United States. The European Union, for example, has banned over 2,400 chemicals in cosmetics such as deodorant, nail polish, makeup, lotion, shaving cream, and lotions. In comparison, the United States Food and Drug Administration has only banned or restricted 11 of those chemicals.

Consensus agrees that clean refers to products that favor natural ingredients although synthetics that have been deemed safe for people and the planet can be used. Clean products exclude sulfites, parabens and formaldehyde-releasing agents. Products that are certified organic are grown using organic methods that do not use synthetic chemicals or genetic engineering.

Vicki advertises that her products will actually “detoxify people, so for example, the water quality in Cherokee isn’t great and this will detoxify its effects.” She added, “that’s why I love this line. People use this stuff to shampoo and their hair will look a shade or two brighter because it detoxed all the nitrates and other stuff.”

She notes that the products are all safe to use on children and she even has hair care products that will remove chlorine buildup for those people who spend a lot of time in the pool.

Vicki specializes in men’s hair cutting, but her salon offers a full range of services. “I specialize in men’s cutting so doing fades, doing the different haircuts and then I also do womens. My hair color line is also clean. So I have ammonia-free bleach, I have organic perms, all sorts of stuff.”

Unlike many places where beauty treatments such as manicures and pedicures focus only on improving appearance, UpperCuts takes a broader approach and concentrates on combining their treatments with wellness. For example, pedicures can include additional treatments like ionic detoxes, which pull toxins through the lymphatic system and pores in the feet. The footbaths use herbal mineral ingredients and she offers foot and leg massages based on reflexology techniques.

An interesting feature of her salon is a reset room with redlight therapy. Vicki explained that the space also uses near-infrared red light therapy. Benefits of the treatment could include smoother skin, smoothing wrinkles and fine lines, promoting collagen production, and rejuvenation of the overall appearance of skin including acne and stretch marks. The near-infrared light could also help with wound healing, mood, vitamin D absorption, muscle recovery, nerve injury, joint pain, arthritis, hair loss, and more.

Vicki acknowledges that although a lot of these treatments are based on ideas that are slowly becoming more popular. Not a lot of people know about them or understand how they work. “People are slowly catching on,” she said. “People who have been coming in here with arthritis or bent backs and stuff like that, it [the red light therapy] gives them a relief because it penetrates deeper.”

UpperCuts offers walk-in appointments for basic haircuts only on Mondays and Thursdays from 2-7 p.m. She takes appointments on Thursdays 12-2, Fridays 9-5 and Saturdays 9-2."

1146367881,20231214,"Members of the European Union (EU) agreed on Thursday to open accession talks for Ukraine, signaling a positive step for Kyiv.

European leaders voted in agreement on Thursday to open negotiations for Ukraine to join the EU membership, European Council President Charles Michel announced on Thursday. The council also agreed to open similar negotiations for Moldova and granted candidacy status to Georgia. (RELATED: Zelenskyy Says Summer Counteroffensive Did Not Achieve Its Aims)

“A clear signal of hope for their people and for our continent,” Michael said on Thursday. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who opposes allowing Ukraine into the EU, left the council chambers when the subject was brought up and was not present when voting began, allowing for a unanimous decision from the other European leaders present, according to Politico Europe. Orban said earlier in the day on Thursday that letting Ukraine into the EU would have “devastating consequences.” “Hungary does not want to be part of this bad decision!” Orban said on Facebook Thursday.

The task of bringing Ukraine into the EU fold will be challenging and take time, according to Bloomberg. Official negotiations will not begin until March and it could take years for the process to be finalized.

Still, it is being viewed as a positive by EU leaders and by Kyiv, who had applied for candidacy status days after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to Politico Europe.

“I thank everyone who worked for this to happen and everyone who helped. I congratulate every Ukrainian on this day,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday. “History is made by those who don’t get tired of fighting for freedom.”

Ukraine is also seeking membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) but has thus far been denied candidacy, as Western leaders feel the country should not join during a time of war. President Joe Biden said during a joint press conference with Zelenskyy this week that Ukraine will join NATO “when all allies agree and conditions are met,” according to MSNBC. “Right now, we have to make sure they win the war,” Biden said.

The European Council said that Ukraine will have to meet certain conditions if it wants to join the EU membership, including lobbying regulations and a harsher crackdown on corruption, according to Bloomberg. Ukraine has already adopted three EU conditions through legislation and plans to adopt the fourth soon.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1146367883,20231214,"Artificial intelligence went mainstream in 2023 — it was a long time coming yet has a long way to go for the technology to match people's science fiction fantasies of human-like machines.

Catalyzing a year of AI fanfare was ChatGPT. The chatbot gave the world a glimpse of recent advances in computer science even if not everyone figured out quite how it works or what to do with it.

“I would call this an inflection moment,” pioneering AI scientist Fei-Fei Li said. “2023 is, in history, hopefully going to be remembered for the profound changes of the technology as well as the public awakening. It also shows how messy this technology is.”

It was a year for people to figure out “what this is, how to use it, what’s the impact — all the good, the bad and the ugly,"" she said.

The first AI panic of 2023 set in soon after New Year's Day when classrooms reopened and schools from Seattle to Paris started blocking ChatGPT. Teenagers were already asking the chatbot — released in late 2022 — to compose essays and answer take-home tests.

AI large language models behind technology such as ChatGPT work by repeatedly guessing the next word in a sentence after having “learned” the patterns of a huge trove of human-written works. They often get facts wrong. But the outputs appeared so natural that it sparked curiosity about the next AI advances and its potential use for trickery and deception.

Worries escalated as this new cohort of generative AI tools — spitting out not just words but novel images, music and synthetic voices — threatened the livelihoods of anyone who writes, draws, strums or codes for a living. It fueled strikes by Hollywood writers and actors and legal challenges from visual artists and bestselling authors.

Some of the AI field’s most esteemed scientists warned that the technology’s unchecked progress was marching toward outsmarting humans and possibly threatening their existence, while other scientists called their concerns overblown or brought attention to more immediate risks.

By spring, AI-generated deepfakes — some more convincing than others — had leaped into U.S. election campaigns, where one falsely showed Donald Trump embracing the nation’s former top infectious disease expert. The technology made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fabricated war footage in Ukraine and Gaza.

By the end of the year, the AI crises had shifted to ChatGPT's own maker, the San Francisco startup OpenAI, nearly destroyed by corporate turmoil over its charismatic CEO, and to a government meeting room in Belgium, where exhausted political leaders from across the European Union emerged after days of intense talks with a deal for the world's first major AI legal safeguards.

The new AI law won't take effect until 2025, and other lawmaking bodies — including the U.S. Congress — are still a long way from enacting their own.

There's no question that commercial AI products unveiled in 2023 incorporated technological achievements not possible in earlier stages of AI research, which trace back to the mid-20th century.

But the latest generative AI trend is at peak hype, according to the market research firm Gartner, which has tracked what it calls the “hype cycle” of emerging technology since the 1990s. Picture a wooden rollercoaster ticking up to its highest hill, about to careen down into what Gartner describes as a “trough of disillusionment” before coasting back to reality.

“Generative AI is right in the peak of inflated expectations,” Gartner analyst Dave Micko said. “There’s massive claims by vendors and producers of generative AI around its capabilities, its ability to deliver those capabilities.”

Google drew criticism this month for editing a video demonstration of its most capable AI model, called Gemini, in a way that made it appear more impressive — and human-like.

Micko said leading AI developers are pushing certain ways of applying the latest technology, most of which correspond to their current line of products — be they search engines or workplace productivity software. That doesn't mean that's how the world will use it.

“As much as Google and Microsoft and Amazon and Apple would love us to adopt the way that they think about their technology and that they deliver that technology, I think adoption actually comes from the bottom up,” he said.

IS IT DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

It's easy to forget that this isn't the first wave of AI commercialization. Computer vision techniques developed by Li and other scientists helped sort through a huge database of photos to recognize objects and individual faces and help guide self-driving cars. Speech recognition advances made voice assistants like Siri and Alexa a fixture in many people's lives.

“When we launched Siri in 2011, it was at that point the fastest-growing consumer app and the only major mainstream application of AI that people had ever experienced,” said Tom Gruber, co-founder of Siri Inc., which Apple bought and made an integral iPhone feature.

But Gruber believes what's happening now is the “biggest wave ever” in AI, unleashing new possibilities as well as dangers.

“We’re surprised that we could accidentally encounter this astonishing ability with language, by training a machine to play solitaire on all of the internet,"" Gruber said. ""It’s kind of amazing.”

The dangers could come fast in 2024, as major national elections in the U.S., India and elsewhere could get flooded with AI-generated deepfakes.

In the longer term, AI technology's rapidly improving language, visual perception and step-by-step planning capabilities could supercharge the vision of a digital assistant — but only if granted access to the “inner loop of our digital life stream,” Gruber said.

“They can manage your attention as in, ‘You should watch this video. You should read this book. You should respond to this person’s communication,'” Gruber said. “That is what a real executive assistant does. And we could have that, but with a really big risk of personal information and privacy.”"

Depoian said instead, Berger used his own sperm and impregnated her. Depoian said she would not have consented if Berger told her he was going to use his own sperm.

The lawsuit said Bester made the discovery when she purchased DNA kits from Ancestry.com and 23andMe this year. According to the lawsuit, Bester learned she was related to Berger's granddaughter and his second cousin. After speaking with some of them, she learned that Berger was her biological father.

""To say I was shocked when I figured this out would be an extreme understatement,"" said Bester.

In a statement, Depoian's lawyer said she contacted Berger and he didn't deny that she consented only to an insemination with the sperm from someone who didn't know her and who she didn't know.

""We fully trusted Dr Berger,"" said Depoian. ""He was a medical professional, it's hard to imagine not trusting your own doctor. We never dreamt he would abuse his position of trust and perpetrate this extreme violation.""﻿

Berger's lawyer also released a statement on his behalf: ""Dr. Merle Berger was a pioneer in the medical fertility field who in 50 years of practice helped thousands of families fulfill their dreams of having a child.""

""He is widely known for his sensitivity to the emotional anguish of the women who came to him for help conceiving. The allegations concern events from over 40 years ago, in the early days of artificial insemination.

""At a time before sperm banks and IVF, it was dramatically different from modern-day fertility treatment. The allegations, which have changed repeatedly in the six months since the plaintiff's attorney first contacted Dr Berger, have no legal or factual merit, and will be disproven in court."""
1146398652,20231214,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union failed to agree on a 50 billion-euro ($54 billion) package in financial aid that Ukraine desperately needs to stay afloat, even as the bloc decided Thursday to open accession negotiations with the war-torn country.

The aid was vetoed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, delivering another tough blow to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after he failed this week to persuade U.S. lawmakers to approve an additional $61 billion for Ukraine, mainly to buy weapons from the U.S.

The start of accession talks was a momentous moment and stunning reversal for a country at war that had struggled to find the backing for its membership aspirations and long faced obstinate opposition from Orban.

Hungary's leader decided not to veto the accession talks, but then blocked the aid package.

“I can inform you that 26 leaders agreed on the (budget negotiation),” European Council President Charles Michel said. “I should be very precise. One leader, Sweden, needs to consult its parliament, which is in line with the usual procedure for this country, and one leader couldn’t agree.”

The decisions required unanimity among the EU's members.

Still, Michel, who was chairing the Brussels summit, called the start of accession talks “a clear signal of hope for their people and our continent.”

Although the process between opening negotiations and Ukraine finally becoming a member could take many years, Zelenskyy welcomed the agreement as “a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe.”

“History is made by those who don’t get tired of fighting for freedom,” Zelenskyy said.

The financial package could not be endorsed after Orban vetoed both the extra money and a review of the EU budget. Ukraine is badly counting on the funds to help its damaged economy survive in the coming year.

Michel said leaders would reconvene in January in an effort to break the deadlock.

Orban had warned before the summit that forcing a decision on the Ukraine issues could destroy EU unity. Decisions on enlarging the EU and on a review of its long-term budget, which contains the 50 billion euros ($54.1 billion) in aid for the government in Kyiv, must be unanimous among all 27 member countries.

Orban had also threatened to veto the start of accession talks but ultimately backpedaled.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called the opening of membership discussions a black eye for Russian President Vladimir Putin. “It is a very clear message to Moscow. Us Europeans, we don’t let go of Ukraine,” he said.

Orban said that his opposition remained steadfast, but that he decided not to use his veto because the 26 other nations were arguing so strongly in favor. Under EU rules, an abstention does not prevent a decision from being adopted.

An EU official, who insisted on not being quoted by name because the summit negotiations were private, said Orban was “momentarily absent from the room in a pre-agreed and constructive manner” when the decision was made.

Orban said he stepped aside since all of his counterparts were committed to putting Ukraine on the EU membership path, though their position did not change his mind.

“Hungary’s perspective is clear: Ukraine is not ready for us to begin negotiations on its EU membership. It’s a completely illogical, irrational and improper decision” he said.

Others lauded Orban's gesture. They had been preparing for the summit spilling over into an extra day Saturday.

“Certainly quicker than any of us expected,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said.

“In fairness to Prime Minister Orban, he made his case, made it very strongly. He disagrees with this decision and he’s not changing his opinion in that sense, but essentially decided not to use the veto power,"" Varadkar said.

""I respect the fact that he he didn’t do that, because it would have put us in a very difficult position as a European Union,” the Irish leader added.

Belgium's De Croo had a slightly different take, saying he thought Orban “didn’t use his veto because he realized that it would be indefensible.”

At the same time as Ukraine, the EU leaders also decided to open membership negotiations with Ukraine's neighbor Moldova.

In the United States, national security adviser Jake Sullivan welcomed “the EU’s historic decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, a crucial step toward fulfilling their Euro-Atlantic aspirations.”

In Kyiv, the news was met with cautious optimism.

“We are Europe. Ukraine is Europe, the center of Europe. I want us to be given the status of a proud member of Europe,” said Olha Paradovska, a 70-year-old Kyiv resident.

Ivan Olezhko, 19, said the decision to start accession talks was long overdue. “If everything goes well, I will be happy, but we don’t know what will happen next,” he said.

EU leaders had expected the summit to take at least until late Friday before any sort of breakthrough might be clinched, so the fateful announcement came totally unexpectedly after Orban did not block the move by his colleagues.

A beaming Michel came down in the summit media room unscheduled and said “This is a historic moment, and it shows the credibility of the European Union. The strength of the European Union. The decision is made.”

He said the negotiations would open before a report will be made to the leaders in March.

The surprise came at a dire time for Zelenskyy, straight off a trip this week to Washington where his pleas for more aid from the U.S. Congress fell on deaf ears. Ukraine's president was looking for a better response in Brussels.

“It is just as important that Ukraine has the means to continue the war and rebuild its country,” De Croo said.

The urgency to find a solution is matched only by the potential blow to the EU's credibility, the Ukrainian president said in a video address to the leaders assembled in Brussels.

“Nobody wants Europe to be seen as untrustworthy. Or as unable to take decisions it prepared itself,” he said.

1146406342,20231215,"“For now, Ozempic is like Kleenex, but we should stop using it that way,” Yasmin Tayag says.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Ozempic broke out in a big way this year. By the time Jimmy Kimmel made a crack at the Oscars about the medication, bringing it a new surge of national attention, diabetes and obesity drugs that suppress appetite had been on the rise for months. I spoke with my colleague Yasmin Tayag, who covers health and science for The Atlantic, about the future potential of these drugs and the existing barriers to access.

First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Lora Kelley: Before this year, I had never heard of Ozempic. Now I see articles and ads for appetite-suppressing drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy everywhere. To what extent are these treatments a passing fad versus a force that is here to stay?

Yasmin Tayag: These drugs are definitely here to stay. Doctors have seen obesity drugs come and go, but this particular class seems to have real staying power, because it works and it’s safe, as far as we can tell.

The class of appetite-suppressing drugs known as GLP-1 agonists has been around for a long time. Ozempic is one of the newer, more powerful drugs in this class.

There are so many similar new drugs in development. And they’re all trying to one-up one another in terms of potency, side effects, and even formulation—whether an injection or a pill. In 2024, we’re likely to see more pharmaceutical companies applying for approval for new drugs, and potentially a lot more people getting on the existing drugs that are already approved. They’re going to become more of a household concept. (I don’t want to say “household name,” because there are so many different brands coming out.)

There are a lot of silly, out-there projections about how the presence of these drugs will affect industries, from airplanes to snack food. If that future comes, it’s very far off. But in terms of health: If more Americans go on these drugs, the hope is that we’ll see rates of obesity go down and fewer people having related health problems.

Lora: What are some factors keeping people from accessing these drugs?

Yasmin: The major obstacle to these drugs becoming totally mainstream is the cost. They’re so expensive. They’re not covered by most private insurance providers or by Medicare, because traditionally, obesity has not been seen as a medical condition. It’s been seen as cosmetic. But as these drugs show a benefit in areas such as heart disease, insurance companies may face more pressure to cover them.

Lora: How will the market change as more brands try to break into this space?

Yasmin: The hope is that as more competitors enter the market, the prices of the drugs as a class are going to come down further and further. I don’t think prices will be appreciably different in 2024, but in five years, maybe we’ll start seeing some real change.

Obesity pills, which may be available as early as next year, could theoretically be good for costs in two ways: The first is that the pills themselves are cheaper to make, because they don’t require all of the hardware that goes into making an injectable pen, and they don’t need to be stored under refrigeration.

Lora: I find myself referring to this class of drugs using the catchall Ozempic. Will Ozempic become, like Kleenex, a brand name that stands in for a whole category?

Yasmin: Ozempic is frequently used to refer to this whole class of drugs. But Ozempic itself is actually not an obesity drug—it’s for diabetes. (The exact same drug, packaged and sold as Wegovy, is for obesity. They have the same active ingredient—semaglutide—and the only difference is that Wegovy is available in a higher dose.)

The names that companies are giving these drugs feel so ridiculous. When you list them, it’s like word salad. I can see why people want to have a single name to refer to all of them. For now, Ozempic is like Kleenex, but we should stop using it that way.

In 1892, the French sculptor Camille Claudel applied to France’s Ministry of Fine Arts for a block of marble. As was customary, the ministry sent an inspector to decide whether her planned work was worth the state’s support. Her plaster model, showing two nude figures waltzing, was a “virtuoso performance,” the official wrote. Not even Auguste Rodin, Claudel’s mentor, could “have studied with more artistic finesse and consciousness the quivering life of muscles and skin.” But although the ministry commissioned equally sensual works from Rodin in that era, it refused to support one by a female artist … Claudel bent every effort to make a name for herself, undeterred by the restrictive mores of her time. Though she won acclaim at the height of her brief career, her reputation faded in the decades after her death. Despite renewed interest in Claudel’s work in the 1980s, her tumultuous life story and Rodin’s role in it tended to deflect attention from her art, particularly in the United States. “Her best pieces,” H. W. Janson and Anthony F. Janson wrote in their canonical History of Art, “might pass for his.” But Claudel’s oeuvre, especially its sensitive and moving evocation of women’s interior lives, is not so easily dismissed. The new show presses the argument that Claudel ranks among the greatest French sculptors of the 19th century.

“It is just as important that Ukraine has the means to continue the war and rebuild its country,” De Croo said.

The urgency to find a solution is matched only by the potential blow to the EU's credibility, the Ukrainian president said in a video address to the leaders assembled in Brussels.

“Nobody wants Europe to be seen as untrustworthy. Or as unable to take decisions it prepared itself,” he said.

1146401726,20231215,"Artificial intelligence went mainstream in 2023 — it was a long time coming yet has a long way to go for the technology to match people's science fiction fantasies of human-like machines.

Catalyzing a year of AI fanfare was ChatGPT. The chatbot gave the world a glimpse of recent advances in computer science even if not everyone figured out quite how it works or what to do with it.

“I would call this an inflection moment,” pioneering AI scientist Fei-Fei Li said. “2023 is, in history, hopefully going to be remembered for the profound changes of the technology as well as the public awakening. It also shows how messy this technology is.”

It was a year for people to figure out “what this is, how to use it, what’s the impact — all the good, the bad and the ugly,"" she said.

The first AI panic of 2023 set in soon after New Year's Day when classrooms reopened and schools from Seattle to Paris started blocking ChatGPT. Teenagers were already asking the chatbot — released in late 2022 — to compose essays and answer take-home tests.

AI large language models behind technology such as ChatGPT work by repeatedly guessing the next word in a sentence after having “learned” the patterns of a huge trove of human-written works. They often get facts wrong. But the outputs appeared so natural that it sparked curiosity about the next AI advances and its potential use for trickery and deception.

Worries escalated as this new cohort of generative AI tools — spitting out not just words but novel images, music and synthetic voices — threatened the livelihoods of anyone who writes, draws, strums or codes for a living. It fueled strikes by Hollywood writers and actors and legal challenges from visual artists and bestselling authors.

Some of the AI field’s most esteemed scientists warned that the technology’s unchecked progress was marching toward outsmarting humans and possibly threatening their existence, while other scientists called their concerns overblown or brought attention to more immediate risks.

By spring, AI-generated deepfakes — some more convincing than others — had leaped into U.S. election campaigns, where one falsely showed Donald Trump embracing the nation’s former top infectious disease expert. The technology made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fabricated war footage in Ukraine and Gaza.

By the end of the year, the AI crises had shifted to ChatGPT's own maker, the San Francisco startup OpenAI, nearly destroyed by corporate turmoil over its charismatic CEO, and to a government meeting room in Belgium, where exhausted political leaders from across the European Union emerged after days of intense talks with a deal for the world's first major AI legal safeguards.

The new AI law will take a few years to fully take effect, and other lawmaking bodies — including the U.S. Congress — are still a long way from enacting their own.

There's no question that commercial AI products unveiled in 2023 incorporated technological achievements not possible in earlier stages of AI research, which trace back to the mid-20th century.

But the latest generative AI trend is at peak hype, according to the market research firm Gartner, which has tracked what it calls the “hype cycle” of emerging technology since the 1990s. Picture a wooden rollercoaster ticking up to its highest hill, about to careen down into what Gartner describes as a “trough of disillusionment” before coasting back to reality.

“Generative AI is right in the peak of inflated expectations,” Gartner analyst Dave Micko said. “There’s massive claims by vendors and producers of generative AI around its capabilities, its ability to deliver those capabilities.”

Google drew criticism this month for editing a video demonstration of its most capable AI model, called Gemini, in a way that made it appear more impressive — and human-like.

Micko said leading AI developers are pushing certain ways of applying the latest technology, most of which correspond to their current line of products — be they search engines or workplace productivity software. That doesn't mean that's how the world will use it.

“As much as Google and Microsoft and Amazon and Apple would love us to adopt the way that they think about their technology and that they deliver that technology, I think adoption actually comes from the bottom up,” he said.

IS IT DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

It's easy to forget that this isn't the first wave of AI commercialization. Computer vision techniques developed by Li and other scientists helped sort through a huge database of photos to recognize objects and individual faces and help guide self-driving cars. Speech recognition advances made voice assistants like Siri and Alexa a fixture in many people's lives.

“When we launched Siri in 2011, it was at that point the fastest-growing consumer app and the only major mainstream application of AI that people had ever experienced,” said Tom Gruber, co-founder of Siri Inc., which Apple bought and made an integral iPhone feature.

But Gruber believes what's happening now is the “biggest wave ever” in AI, unleashing new possibilities as well as dangers.

“We’re surprised that we could accidentally encounter this astonishing ability with language, by training a machine to play solitaire on all of the internet,"" Gruber said. ""It’s kind of amazing.”

The dangers could come fast in 2024, as major national elections in the U.S., India and elsewhere could get flooded with AI-generated deepfakes.

In the longer term, AI technology's rapidly improving language, visual perception and step-by-step planning capabilities could supercharge the vision of a digital assistant — but only if granted access to the “inner loop of our digital life stream,” Gruber said.

“They can manage your attention as in, ‘You should watch this video. You should read this book. You should respond to this person’s communication,'” Gruber said. “That is what a real executive assistant does. And we could have that, but with a really big risk of personal information and privacy.”"

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union decided Thursday to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, a momentous moment and stunning reversal for a country at war that had struggled to find the backing for its membership aspirations and long faced obstinate opposition from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

European Council President Charles Michel, who was chairing a Brussels summit of the EU’s 27 leaders where the decision was made, called it “a clear signal of hope for their people and our continent.”

Although the process between opening negotiations and Ukraine finally becoming a member could take many years, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the agreement as “a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe.”

“History is made by those who don’t get tired of fighting for freedom,” Zelenskyy said.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said it also was a black eye for Russian President Vladimir Putin: “It is a very clear message to Moscow. Us Europeans, we don’t let go of Ukraine,” he said.

Orban said his opposition remained steadfast, but, with a unanimous decision required, he decided to let his right to oppose lapse because the 26 others were arguing so strongly in favour. Under EU rules, an abstention does not prevent a decision from being adopted.

An EU official, who asked not to be identified because the summit negotiations were private, said Orban was “momentarily absent from the room in a pre-agreed and constructive manner” when the decision was made.

Orban said he stepped aside since all of his counterparts were committed to putting Ukraine on the EU membership path, though their position did not change his mind.

“Hungary’s perspective is clear: Ukraine is not ready for us to begin negotiations on its EU membership. It’s a completely illogical, irrational and improper decision” he said.

Others lauded Orban’s gesture; they were preparing for a summit that some feared might spill over into an extra day Saturday.

“Certainly quicker than any of us expected,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said.

“In fairness to Prime Minister Orban, he made his case, made it very strongly. He disagrees with this decision and he’s not changing his opinion in that sense, but essentially decided not to use the veto power,” Varadkar said.

“I respect the fact that he didn’t do that, because it would have put us in a very difficult position as a European Union,” the Irish leader added.

Belgium’s De Croo had a slightly different take, saying he thought Orban “didn’t use his veto because he realised that it would be indefensible.”

At the same time as Ukraine, the EU leaders also decided to open membership negotiations with Ukraine’s neighbour Moldova.

In the United States, national security adviser Jake Sullivan welcomed “the EU’s historic decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, a crucial step toward fulfilling their Euro-Atlantic aspirations.”

Left on the summit agenda now is a promise to give Ukraine the money and wherewithal to stave off Russia’s invasion, another agenda item held up by Orban.

The Hungarian leader came into the summit vowing to both block the plans by his 26 fellow leaders to officially declare that membership negotiations with Ukraine can start, and more pressingly, deny Kyiv 50 billion euros ($54 billion) in financial aid that the country desperately needs to stay afloat.

“The European Union is about to make a terrible mistake and they must be stopped — even if 26 of them want to do it, and we are the only ones against it,” Orban said in comments released by his office Thursday. “This is a mistake, we are destroying the European Union.”

In Kyiv, the news was met with cautious optimism.

“We are Europe. Ukraine is Europe, the centre of Europe. I want us to be given the status of a proud member of Europe,” said Olha Paradovska, a 70-year-old Kyiv resident.

Ivan Olezhko, 19, said the decision to start accession talks was long overdue. “If everything goes well, I will be happy, but we don’t know what will happen next,” he said.

EU leaders had expected the summit to take at least until late Friday before any sort of breakthrough might be clinched, so the fateful announcement came totally unexpectedly after Orban did not block the move by his colleagues.

A beaming Michel came down in the summit media room unscheduled and said “This is a historic moment, and it shows the credibility of the European Union. The strength of the European Union. The decision is made.”

He said the negotiations would open before a report will be made to the leaders in March.

The surprise came at a dire time for Zelenskyy, straight off a trip this week to Washington where his pleas for more aid from the US Congress fell on deaf ears. Ukraine’s president was looking for a better response in Brussels.

“It is just as important that Ukraine has the means to continue the war and rebuild its country,” De Croo said.

The urgency to find a solution is matched only by the potential blow to the EU’s credibility, the Ukrainian president said in a video address to the leaders assembled in Brussels.

“Nobody wants Europe to be seen as untrustworthy. Or as unable to take decisions it prepared itself,” he said.

“Whatever it takes” had been the relentless mantra of the EU in pledging its support, leaders dressed up in the yellow and sky-blue colours of Ukraine, and countless speeches ending with the rallying cry “Slava Ukraini!” — “Glory to Ukraine!”

And again, against the odds, the EU prevailed."

1146428940,20231215,"We received this statement from Palestine Solidarity Austria. To understand the importance of the current developments, one should be aware that Austria, a country of 9 million residents of whom 17% are non-citizens, had been neutral regarding military pacts since the end of World War II. That means that even though it was a capitalist country and part of the imperialist world, Austria, unlike Western Germany and now Germany, was not a member of NATO and maintained normal working relations with the USSR and Eastern European socialist countries.

In the past few years, the government in Vienna has lined up closely with the NATO states. Regarding the current situation in Gaza, the Austrian government, like those in Germany, France and other NATO members, has persecuted those organizations opposing Israel’s genocidal attack. Translation: John Catalinotto.

The Palestinian people have the human right to self-determination — and thus also the human right to political representation.

Whenever there is talk of Palestinian resistance to the occupation in our political media, the unwritten law is that this resistance must be referred to as “terror” — with an insistence that indicates that the ruling elites themselves know that something is wrong.

Essentially, the rulers’ aim is to divert attention from the colonial roots of the violent conflict and to avoid addressing the systematic displacement of the original population, complete with occupation and apartheid. The structural violence by a state of European and U.S. settlers and the systematic inequality of oppressors and oppressed is concealed by pointing exclusively to the counter-violence of the oppressed. This counter-violence is decontextualized, personalized and condemned — and thus the rights of the Palestinians are also wiped away.

This is a fundamental distortion of international law. According to this law, foreign occupation is illegal and resistance against the occupation is legitimate!

As far as Gaza in particular is concerned, in 2006 Gazans held all-Palestinian elections, which Hamas clearly won. The Palestinians widely supported this party because they perceived it as not representing the failed cooperation expressed in the Oslo peace project and, as is well known, led to continued and accelerated Israeli settlement activity and turning the rest of Palestine into Bantustans. However, the ethno-chauvinist colonialists and their Western supporters, the United States and the European Union, refused to recognize this democratic decision.

Thus the particular misfortune of the Palestinians in Gaza took its terrible course. Israel imposed a blockade against millions of Palestinians crammed into a very confined space. Israel attacked Gaza militarily five times with a disproportionate number of civilian casualties. According to the United Nations, around twenty times more Palestinians died in these wars than Israelis.

The occupiers claimed and still claim that they want to eradicate Hamas. In fact, however, they have never succeeded, even before the blockade, in crushing the Palestinian struggle for equal democratic rights, the recognition of human rights through a just peace and an end to the occupation with the ongoing war and the blockade. They failed, because this resistance represents the democratic will of the broad population, regardless of the political form in which it is expressed. That is why Israel and its allies in the European Union and the U.S. are perpetuating displacement and genocide in the worst possible way and delegitimizing resistance.

Billions of people around the world are moving in solidarity with the Palestinians. Yet it is the immense Western support for the Israeli colonial regime that continues to drive the spiral of injustice and violence.

Half a century ago, the events were not much different when the Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization resistance organization as a negotiating partner in a groundbreaking way — despite the fact that the PLO’s armed activities were not limited to historical Palestine, as is the case today and, significantly, also on the part of Hamas. What it also did was to recognize the political side of self-determination, namely the fundamental right of Palestine to have its own political representation.

Today, official Austria is trying to prevent this inevitable necessity for the establishment of a lasting and just peace from being recognized, namely the fundamental collective democratic right to political self-determination. This is why not only do Israel and the West fight the Palestinian resistance with violence aimed at extermination, but it also persecutes the non-violent and civil society campaign for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS for short) against the apartheid state of Israel as “antisemitic.”

They intend to silence all voices that speak out against the genocide and stand on the side of the Palestinians and their resistance.

The EU has classified all armed groups of the Palestinian resistance as terrorists. We know that when the Western powers use violence to defend their interests, the terminology used to describe it quickly becomes “war on terror” and “defense of freedom.” In the wake of the terror frenzy, Austria has also tightened its laws to such an extent that peaceful political expression of opinion can be interpreted as supporting terror. Austria has passed an anti-democratic symbol law that makes it a criminal offense to fly the flag of even an elected Lebanese ruling party.

The duplicity of Austria and the EU is also evident in the EU-Israel Association Agreement. It grants Israel major trade privileges and obliges it to respect human rights in Paragraph 2. Despite Israel’s thousands of violations of this obligation, the powers that be in Vienna and Brussels refuse to exert pressure on Israel by threatening to terminate the agreement.

In this sense, the political-media elites are trying to disparage Palestine solidarity as support for Hamas and to cast its activists as being linked to terrorism, although we are doing nothing other than applying former Chancellor Kreisky’s position in today’s context.

Currently, the political-media complex is raging, because the “Antiracist Initiative Dar al Janub” (House of the South), a member organization of the “Palestine Solidarity Austria” alliance, is allegedly spreading Hamas propaganda. All they offer as vivid “proof” is a photo of a member of the association with Ismail Haniyya, the chairperson of Hamas.

Calls for a ban on Dar al Janub become loud. According to this logic and the current legal situation, Austrian Chancellor Kreisky, when he met with [former PLO leader Yasser] Arafat in 1979 and thus interpreted Austrian neutrality in a highly peacemaking manner, was by this act “approving of terrorist crimes” — the legal term that is often used here.

Is it not “condoning terrorist crimes” if the German government declares its support for the genocide in Gaza by raising the Israeli flag, if the Austrian government votes against a cease-fire in the U.N. General Assembly, if it unreservedly sides with the colonial and imperialist perpetrators in violation of constitutional neutrality and distortion of the basic anti-fascist stance? Many, very many, people are bitterly offended by this — but they are still silent in the face of media terror.

We will not stop raising our voices in defense of basic democratic rights, the constitution and Austrian neutrality, as well as the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.

Restoration of freedom of expression — which includes standing up for the recognition of the Palestinian resistance, represented by different organizations, as the political representation of the Palestinian people!

Put an end to the criminalization of the solidarity movement with the Palestinians and restore the right to demonstrate without restrictions!

We must get out of the escalation of violence! Therefore: Cease-fire immediately!

Peace needs justice: Stop the Israeli policy of occupation, land theft and apartheid!

And an end to Austria’s manifold complicity with Israel’s apartheid and settler colonialism!"
1146435517,20231115,"Airbnb is spending a record amount of money lobbying the federal government this year. The short-term rental marketplace has spent $820,000 in the first nine months of 2023, more than the company spent during the same period any prior year. The company is outpacing its spending in 2022, when it spent a record $1 million lobbying the federal government over the course of the year.

A company spokesperson with the company told OpenSecrets they don’t anticipate surpassing last year’s federal lobbying total in 2023.

Short-term rental services like Airbnb and VRBO have come under increased scrutiny for their impact on housing affordability and on traditional hospitality industries, like hotels. These criticisms have led to attempts to ban or regulate the industry, particularly at the municipal level.

Airbnb’s 2023 federal lobbying reports only list one bill by name, the Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2023. Introduced by Sen. Amy Klobochar (D-Minn.), it would require prices shown on short-term rental listings to include all required fees.

A version of the bill was introduced in the House by Rep. Kim Young (R-Calif.) earlier this month, which includes an additional section barring state and local governments from enforcing their own laws about transparent pricing, establishing a “national standard.”

Airbnb publicly announced its support for the House bill last week, praising its creation of an industry-wide standard for price display. In its statement, the company mentioned that Airbnb’s Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson met with President Joe Biden at the White House to “highlight private sector companies that have launched price display improvements for consumers.”

The rest of Airbnb’s lobbying disclosures only mention general topics, like “housing policy,” “content moderation,” and “travel and tourism.”

Airbnb spent a record $1 million on federal lobbying last year and reported lobbying on seven distinct bills, including the Cut Red Tape For Online Sales Act, which would increase the threshold for when individuals need to report payments received for goods or services to the IRS using Form 1099-K. Under the legislation, the reporting threshold would increase from $600 to $5,000.

The bill was first introduced in March 2022 but expired at the start of 2023. It was reintroduced in the House last May by its original sponsor, Rep. Chris Pappas (D-N.H.). Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who introduced the original bill in the Senate, has not reintroduced it.

Airbnb did not report lobbying on the Cut Red Tape For Online Sales Act in 2023, but did report lobbying on “general discussions related to IRS Form 1099-K reporting.”

Similarly, Airbnb reported lobbying on the Travel and Tourism Act and the American Data Privacy and Protection Act in 2022. Both bills expired before any significant action, but Airbnb continued lobbying on “general discussions related to travel” and “federal data privacy” in 2023.

Airbnb has spent at least $651,000 lobbying in nine different states tracked by OpenSecrets this year, with spending topping $100,000 in three states: Florida, California and Texas. Multiple states targeted by Airbnb’s lobbying have considered regulations on short-term rentals this year, including additional taxes, occupancy guidelines, and rules on whether the owner of a rental property lives on the property for most of the year.

The company spent $225,000 lobbying in Florida, which was considering a bill that would regulate vacation rentals and change how local governments could regulate them.

The bill ultimately failed when Florida’s legislative chambers couldn’t agree on an amendment that would limit the ability of local governments to apply regulations.

Airbnb spent another $185,000 lobbying in California, where the company is headquartered and state lawmakers were also considering a bill on short-term rentals earlier this year. Senate Bill 584 would have imposed a 15% tax on rentals lasting less than 30 days. The money would go toward “affordable and middle-income housing units that will be owned and managed by a public entity, or mission-driven nonprofit.”

The bill narrowly passed the California state Senate, but its first reading in the Assembly was canceled by the bill’s author, state Sen. Monique Limón (D-Santa Barbara). She intends to revive the measure next year, according to California nonprofit newsroom CalMatters.

Many cities in the state have had regulations and fees levied against short-term rentals for years, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, while San Diego saw new laws take effect in 2023.

The company spent $101,000 lobbying in Texas, where multiple cities, including Dallas and Austin, had short-term rental bans blocked or struck in court this year.

New York City implemented what the company calls a “de facto ban” on short-term rentals earlier this year. Airbnb spent $66,000 on lobbying in New York in 2023.

Outside of the U.S., Airbnb is facing additional regulation. Policymakers in the European Union agreed to multiple measures regulating short-term rentals last month, which include host registration, verification of property details and data sharing with local authorities. In a sponsored column for Politico, Airbnb praised the EU for “giving their final approvals to the world’s first template on how to regulate our platform and industry.”

Canadian officials are also considering regulations on short-term rentals, prompting Airbnb to grow its lobbying efforts in the country. In the meantime, provinces have been implementing their own regulations. Earlier this year, Quebec reworked its stringent regulations on short-term rentals, putting the onus on Airbnb to keep unregistered, illegal listings off of its marketplace.

Dec. 15, 2023: This article was updated to clarify that Airbnb announced support for the House version of the House Hotel Fees Transparency Act of 2023."

Asylum seekers flock from Russia to Finland ahead of border closure More than 200 asylum seekers entered Finland from Russia in during a brief reopening of the border, the Finnish Board Guard said Friday. The Finnish government reopened some border crossings on Thursday to allow travel between the two countries following a two-week closure. The country's government said the borders would shut again from 6:00 pm GMT on Friday, this time for one month. The influx of asylum seekers from Russia into Finland has become a point of contention between the neighboring countries in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, with Helsinki accusing Russia of conducting a ""hybrid operation."" Some 900 asylum seekers from nations such as Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen entered Finland from Russia in November, an increase from less than one per day prior to the Russia-Ukraine war, according to the Border Guard.

National flag flies over the Russian Central Bank headquarters in Moscow, Russia May 27, 2022. Russia's central bank raised interest rates for the fifth consecutive time Friday, increasing its key rate by 1 percentage point to 16%. Governor Elvira Nabiullina said that the central bank was nearing the end of its hiking cycle, but that rates would remain high for as long as necessary as the inflation runs close to 8% year-on-year — well above its 4% target. The bank has raised rates by 8.5 percentage points since July, including during an emergency decision in August after the ruble tumbled past 100 to the dollar and the Kremlin called for tighter monetary policy.

Hungary's Orban says he could still block Ukraine's EU membership talks Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he could still block Ukraine's European Union membership talks, hours after the bloc voted to open discussions. Orban, who abstained from the vote Thursday by leaving the room, said the move to admit the war-torn country to the EU was ""a bad decision."" ""We can halt this process later on, and if needed we will pull the brakes, and the ultimate decision will be made by Hungarian parliament,"" he said, without adding detail on how he might do that. Orban — Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in the bloc — has proved a thorn in the EU's side in its efforts to get the membership talks over the line. The nationalist leader also blocked plans to extend a new financial package to Ukraine, with discussions set to resume in January.

Fake TikTok accounts have spread disinformation on Russia's war in Ukraine to millions of people, new data from the Chinese social media giant shows. Posts on the video-sharing site targeted Ukrainian and Russian users, as well as many across Europe, with content designed to ""artificially amplify pro-Russian narratives"" on the war, TikTok said in a report released Wednesday. Some accounts were fictitiously labeled as news outlets. A separate BBC investigation published Friday identified some 800 fake accounts, which it said targeted European countries with false claims that senior Ukrainian officials and their relatives bought luxury cars or villas abroad after Russia's invasion in February 2022. A TikTok spokesperson told CNBC that the company had already begun to investigate the accounts prior to the BBC investigation and that all fake accounts identified had since been removed.

Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said Friday that the European Union's agreement to open membership talks with Ukraine marked a ""clear victory,"" despite an unconventional sidestep from Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been highly vocal about his opposition to the war-torn country joining the bloc. On Thursday he opted to abstain from — rather than veto — a plan to launch membership talks, allowing the vote to pass unopposed. ""As long as he says the wrong things, but does the right things, we are OK,"" Kallas said of Orban. ""We have been united so far and we were able to deliver the decision on the accession talks yesterday. It was interesting for the history books how it was done, but I will not talk about that today,"" she added.

Putin says talks on prisoner swap for Gershkovich, Whelan are 'not simple' Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he hoped an agreement could be reached with the U.S. over a prisoner swap for the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan, but said talks were complex. ""We want to reach an agreement, and these agreements must be mutually acceptable and must suit both parties,"" Putin said, when asked about the matter during his annual phone-in and press conference. ""It is not simple, I will not go into details now, but in general, it seems to me that we speak a language that is understandable to each other. I hope we will find a solution. But, I repeat, the American side must hear us and make an appropriate decision, one that suits the Russian side,"" he said in comments translated by Reuters. Former U.S. marine Paul Whelan who is being held on suspicion of spying talks with his lawyers Vladimir Zherebenkov and Olga Kralova, as he stands in the courtroom cage after a ruling regarding extension of his detention, in Moscow, Russia, February 22, 2019. Marine veteran Whelan was arrested in 2018 and was convicted of spying for the U.S. in 2020 and sentenced to 16 years in prison. He also denies the charges, as does the U.S. Journalist Gershkovich was arrested on charges of spying in March. He, the Wall Street Journal, and the U.S. deny the charges. The imprisonment of both men is seen as politically motivated. Gershkovich remains in custody and an appeal against an extension of his pre-trial detention was rejected by a Moscow court Thursday. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich stands inside an enclosure for defendants before a court hearing to consider an appeal against his pre-trial detention on espionage charges in Moscow, Russia, September 19, 2023. The WSJ issued a statement, noting that ""while we expected this outcome, it's important that we appeal these rulings to call out the absurd nature of the charge."" ""Evan has been wrongfully detained for more than 250 days for simply doing his job as a journalist, and any portrayal to the contrary is fiction. We will stand with Evan and his family for as long as it takes and continue to demand his immediate release.""

Moscow says conditions not in place to rebuild relations with Washington It would be difficult to rebuild relations with the U.S. as things stand, Russian President Vladimir Putin said when asked at his annual phone-in and news conference whether a normalization of relations was possible. ""When internal changes happen (in the U.S.), when they start respecting other people, other countries, when they start looking for compromise instead of trying to resolve their issues with sanctions and military intervention, then the fundamental conditions will be in place to restore fully-fledged relations,"" Putin told the audience at his public phone-in and press conference Thursday. ""So far, such conditions are not in place, but we are ready for that,"" he said, according to a Reuters translation. U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the U.S.-Russia summit at Villa La Grange on June 16, 2021, in Geneva, Switzerland. Putin again blamed NATO for the deterioration of relations between Russia and the West, saying the military alliance had encroached upon Russia's borders. ""The unbridled desire to creep towards our borders, taking Ukraine into NATO, all this led to this tragedy. Plus the bloody events in Donbass for eight years — all this led to the tragedy that we are now experiencing. They forced us into these actions,"" he said. ""What the United States conceived and organized, Europe stands and silently watches, or plays and sings along with them there. Well how can we build relations with them?"" Putin asked."

1146508805,20231215,"BRUSSELS (AFP): Facebook owner Meta’s text-based app Threads arrived in the European Union on Thursday, months after its global launch in July, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.

Threads is a spin-off of the Instagram photo app and is intended to be a rival to X, formerly known as Twitter, after that platform alienated many users and advertisers following Elon Musk’s purchase last year.

“Today we’re opening Threads to more countries in Europe. Welcome everyone,” Zuckerberg said on Threads.

Threads went live in 100 countries earlier this year but not in the EU. Meta officials cited regulatory clarity as the reason for delaying the social network’s arrival in Europe.

Meta has repeatedly come under the EU’s regulatory microscope, especially over concerns about how it uses people’s data to serve highly targeted advertising.

The European Union has bolstered its legal armoury to rein in Big Tech, with stricter rules to protect European users online and to boost competition in an industry dominated by US giants.

More than 100 million people had joined Threads within a week of its launch that excluded the EU.

Meta said that now EU users can create a Threads profile connected to their Instagram account, but they can also use the app without a profile to browse, share and even report content, as part of the company’s compliance with EU rules.

They cannot, however, interact with Threads content nor post without an Instagram sign-on.

Instagram has some two billion users around the world.

Threads said it had added new features since its launch including a “Following Feed”, the ability to edit a post, search with keywords and tag topics.

Under a landmark law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the EU named Meta as a “gatekeeper”, and its Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp face tougher curbs.

The stricter rules especially impact the world’s biggest online companies. They include Meta, Google’s Alphabet, Amazon Apple, TikTok parent ByteDance and Microsoft.

Zuckerberg said a day earlier that Threads had begun tests where users’ posts will also be available on similar text-based and open-source rival social networks like Mastodon.

“Making Threads interoperable will give people more choice over how they interact and it will help content reach more people. I’m pretty optimistic about this,” Zuckerberg said in a Threads post.

Interoperability is also an EU goal. Under the DMA, the most popular messaging services will have to make it possible for users to send messages to other apps.

Meta is challenging the EU’s designation of its instant messenger service Messenger as a “core platform service” and for its Facebook Marketplace also coming under the DMA’s scope.

The company has struggled to comply with the strict rules of a 2018 EU data privacy regulation.

It hopes that by offering paid ad-free subscriptions in Europe for Facebook and Instagram for users unwilling to have their personal data harvested it will help to avoid further issues.

Threads chief Adam Mosseri also said this week that the app would extend its fact-checking programme next year.

“We currently match fact-check ratings from Facebook or Instagram to Threads, but our goal is for fact-checking partners to have the ability to review and rate misinformation on the app. More to come soon,” he said on Threads.

Another milestone EU law is the Digital Services Act, which forces digital giants to aggressively police content online in the EU, including misinformation, disinformation and hate speech, against the risk of major fines.

AFP is involved in a partnership with Meta providing fact-checking services in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa."

1146511307,20231215,"The San Francisco-based company said in a statement on Wednesday that it was working on introducing new tools for hosts to have their taxes withheld automatically and paid to the Italian tax authorities on their behalf.

“The vast majority of hosts on Airbnb in Italy are ordinary families that are using the platform for supplemental income,” the company said in its statement. “We hope the agreement with the Italian Revenue Agency and recent legislative changes will provide these families with certainty about the rules around hosting for years to come.”

The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in 2022 that member countries could require short-term rental platforms to collect income taxes.

Airbnb said it welcomed clarity provided by the Italian government in next year's budget law on how platforms should withhold income taxes for non-professional hosts in Italy.

""These improvements will make it easier for historic centers such as Venice and Florence to see who is hosting and how often, and to develop proportionate policy solutions in response. Airbnb is committed to working with Italian authorities to make the rules a success,"" the company added.

Italy is a key market for Airbnb, with tens of thousands of hosts using the platform to rent their properties.

As the situation unfolds, assessing the EU's ability to uphold its promises and the impact of ongoing tests on the bilateral relationship becomes imperative.

As highlighted by ABC News, recent developments in Ukraine shed light on the country's complex issues, including geopolitical tensions and internal conflicts. The EU's commitments to Ukraine encompass various areas, such as economic aid, political support, and security assistance.

The geopolitical landscape surrounding Ukraine, detailed in a report by AP News, has tested the EU's promises. Ongoing conflicts, particularly involving Russia, have raised questions about the EU's effectiveness in safeguarding Ukraine's interests and ensuring regional stability.

During a recent summit, European Union leaders were unable to reach an agreement on a proposed $55 billion aid package for Ukraine. The package was intended to provide crucial financial assistance to Ukraine, which has been facing the devastating effects of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

The inability to secure consensus raises concerns about the EU's ability to deliver on its promises and support Ukraine effectively.

In addition to the aid package, EU leaders also failed to reach an agreement on renegotiating the EU budget. This further complicates the situation as it affects the allocation of funds for various initiatives, including aid to Ukraine.

The EU's capacity to address immediate needs and offer substantial aid to Ukraine is compromised by the failure to achieve a consensus in the budget renegotiation.

As the European Union grapples with the intricacies surrounding Ukraine, the scrutiny of its commitments intensifies. The challenge lies in determining how the EU will address these complexities and whether it can fulfill its commitments to Ukraine amidst the ongoing tests."

Osmani said that she will inform the European leaders about the information that Kosovo has gathered with its partners regarding these plans by Serbia. She pointed out that it is necessary to take preventive measures in order to prevent the destabilization of the region from possible attacks by Serbia.

“Today I will inform all European leaders about the information that our security institutions together with our partners have collected in this regard, because these are alarms that we must all take very seriously and act preventively so that Serbia does not destabilize our region anymore,” Osmani stressed two days ago.

The President of Kosovo noted that the time in which the summit is being held is difficult for Europe and the world in general, due to global conflicts. However, she added that the summit proves the importance of peace in the Western Balkans.

“Unfortunately, Serbia is still led by people who want to return our region to the 90s. We must not allow this kind of logic to triumph, that’s why we are working with our partners in the EU to increase security in Kosovo and especially on the aspect of security around the border with Serbia,” said Osmani.

The President of Kosovo also spoke about the draft statute of the Union of Municipalities with a Serbian majority, which was delivered to Kosovo by European and American emissaries on October 21st.

1146527802,20231215,"Bern, 15.12.2023 - At its meeting on 15 December, the Federal Council approved the draft negotiating mandate with the European Union (EU). The mandate sets out guidelines for the negotiations, which will get under way once the mandate is definitively adopted, after consultation with Parliament and the cantons.

The draft negotiating mandate is based on the parameters approved by the Federal Council on 21 June this year, as well as the outcomes of the exploratory talks with the EU and the discussions held with social and economic partners in Switzerland. It sets out the guidelines to be followed by the Swiss delegation in each component of the negotiating package.

The FDFA has been instructed to conduct consultations on this document with the Foreign Affairs Committees and the cantons, in collaboration with the FDHA, the FDJP, the FDF, the EAER and DETEC. The social and economic partners will be invited to comment.

In addition, the Federal Council adopted the report on the exploratory talks. The report sets out the objective of the talks, details the outcomes, and reports on the internal process that is already taking place in Switzerland and will continue until the end of the talks with the EU.

The Federal Council's primary objective is to consolidate and further develop the bilateral path with the EU. To this end, on 25 February 2022, the federal government decided to adopt a comprehensive approach based on a package of cooperation and market access agreements. Compared with the institutional agreement – which the Federal Council terminated in 2021 – the package allows greater flexibility and scope for action to safeguard Switzerland's interests during the negotiations.

Barrier-free access to the EU market is the cornerstone of the package, which seeks to update existing agreements on the single market and to conclude new sectoral agreements in electricity and food safety. These agreements will provide Switzerland with lasting access to its largest export market and allow it to develop partnerships in key areas. Within this framework, there are also exceptions to safeguard Switzerland's vital interests. The institutional issues will be regulated directly in the single market agreements. The package also provides for the adoption of state aid rules in the agreements on air transport, overland transport and electricity.

In addition, the package envisages a cooperation agreement on health and systematic participation in EU programmes, particularly in education and research (like Horizon Europe and Erasmus+). Finally, it includes a regular Swiss contribution towards greater cohesion within the EU.

The exploratory talks started in March 2022 and were concluded at the end of October 2023. The outcomes are recorded in a technical document that sets out the areas of common understanding defined by the Swiss and EU delegations during the exploratory talks in each area of the package.

The common understanding reflects the outcomes of the exploratory process. The solutions it outlines will provide Switzerland and the EU with a conducive framework in which to embark on the negotiations. These solutions will need to be fleshed out and other solutions will need to be found for the outstanding issues.

In this context, the Federal Council has also decided to pursue domestic discussions with the partners concerned on wage protection, electricity and overland transport.

The negotiating mandate defines the goals that the Federal Council has set itself. Once the negotiations are over, the federal government will weigh up the benefits and disadvantages.

The Federal Council thinks the outcome of the exploratory talks constitutes a solid and balanced basis on which to start the negotiations. For example, it was possible to find potential solutions to a number of obstacles that emerged during the talks on the institutional agreement in 2021, in particular regarding the free movement of persons. The issue of state aid was also clarified. However, there are still some pending issues that will need to be addressed during the negotiations.

Eleven rounds of exploratory talks and 46 technical discussions with the EU within the framework of regular contact at political level allowed potential solutions to be defined for all components of the package.

The Federal Council also set out the composition of the Swiss delegation that will negotiate the various areas of the package with the EU. Patric Franzen, deputy state secretary and head of the FDFA's Europe Division, will take on the overall operational lead of the negotiations and will act as chief negotiator. He will perform this task in collaboration with negotiators from the departments responsible for the different areas of the package. The negotiations will be conducted simultaneously in each area and will start once the mandate has been definitively approved by Switzerland and once the EU has also adopted its own negotiating mandate.

1146525479,20231215,"The Court of Justice of the European Union has issued a decisive ruling in favor of the American e-commerce giant Amazon, settling a longstanding dispute with the European Commission regarding tax breaks totaling EUR 250 million granted by Luxembourg.

After months of legal proceedings, the final court instance of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) dismissed the European Commission’s (EC) complaint, which was filed in 2021. The case centered on the legality, under EU regulations, of an agreement forged in 2003 and extended in 2011 between Amazon and the authorities of Luxembourg.

The Court of Justice confirms that the Commission has not established that the tax ruling given to Amazon by Luxembourg was a State aid that was incompatible with the internal market By a tax ruling of 2003, the Luxembourg authorities accepted the Amazon group’s proposal concerning the treatment of two of its subsidiaries established in Luxembourg for the purposes of Luxembourg corporate income tax. By a decision of 2017, the Commission found that that tax ruling constituted a State aid that was incompatible with the internal market. According to the Commission, the account taken of a royalty that one of those two subsidiaries had paid to the other under a licence agreement concluded between them on the use of intangible assets artificially diminished the tax base of the first subsidiary and, ultimately, that of the Amazon group in Luxembourg and in Europe.” states an official release from the the Court of Justice of the European Union.

As a result of this agreement with Luxembourg, Amazon managed to save EUR 250 million in taxes. According to the terms, Amazon established its European headquarters in Luxembourg and fulfilled its tax obligations there.

Leveraging reduced rates, the company was able to transfer nearly 75 percent of its earned profits from all EU countries to the United States. The European Commission contended that, due to these governmental concessions, Amazon had evaded paying approximately EUR 250 million in owed taxes and sought a reimbursement of the amount along with interest.

This marks another setback for the European Commission in its legal battles over tax discrepancies with international corporations. The ongoing struggle reflects a dichotomy in approach – one involving a strategy to minimize taxes to enhance budget revenues in countries hosting corporate operations, while simultaneously encouraging investments through tax incentives, targeted subsidies, job creation grants, and various other financial inducements."

BRUSSELS — A number of European Union leaders sought on Friday to use growing concern about Israel’s military offensive against Hamas terrorists to convince their partners to rally around a united call for a cease-fire.

“The killing of innocent civilians really needs to stop,” Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said. He said the EU must unite “if we want to play a serious role in that conflict, and I think we have to because we will be wearing the consequences if things go further in a bad direction.”

Hamas killed about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and took about 240 hostages, in its Oct. 7 terrorist attack on southern Israel.

More than 18,700 Palestinians have now been killed, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

The EU is the world’s biggest provider of aid to the Palestinians and has been trying to use its diplomatic leverage as a 27-nation bloc to encourage peace moves. The EU is also Israel’s largest trading partner.

Beyond this, the members have long-been divided over Israel and the Palestinians. Austria and Germany are among Israel’s most vocal supporters. Their leaders went to Israel to show solidarity after the assault. Spain and Ireland often focus on the plight of the Palestinian people.

Hamas, for its part, is on the EU’s list of terrorist groups. The United States and Canada also designate Hamas as a terrorist organization.

Since its attack, the bloc has struggled to strike a balance between condemning the Hamas terrorist attacks, supporting Israel’s right to defend itself and ensuring that the rights of civilians on both sides are protected under international law.

At the United Nations on Tuesday, an increasing number of EU members voted for a resolution calling for a cease-fire — a total of 17 — and fewer abstained. Still, Austria and the Czech Republic voted against.

“We now have a clear majority of countries here in the European Union calling for a cease-fire. I think that’s the view of the people of Europe as well,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said.

But Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was less categorical. “In (the) U.N. we were not united as a European Union. But we will hear the worries and like we always do try to work out the compromises,” she told reporters at the EU’s summit in Brussels.

The EU is more united around what should happen once the fighting stops for good.

Mindful that resentment and conflict in the wider Middle East and Gulf regions have been fueled by decades of Israeli-Palestinian tensions, the bloc is exploring ways to realize a long-held EU ideal — two states living peacefully side by side.

The EU has for years tried to promote the idea of an Israeli and a Palestinian state with borders set mostly as they were in 1967, with some land swaps agreed between them. Both would have Jerusalem as their shared capital.

Top EU officials concede that their international peace efforts so far haven’t been effective. This is the fifth war between Israel and Hamas, and the number of deaths in Gaza far exceeds the combined tally of those killed in the previous four, which is estimated to be around 4,000.

An internal discussion paper on the way ahead — a text seen by The Associated Press — insists that the EU must develop a “comprehensive approach.” Officials believe a “whole of Palestine” approach that has Gaza as part of a future Palestinian state remains the most viable option.

The capability of the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank but not Gaza, is “of key importance for the viability and legitimacy” of a two-state solution. It noted that Arab states will only get involved if their efforts lead to “a genuine peace process that results in the two-state solution.”

EU efforts, the document said, should focus on support for an international conference, only “not as a singular event but as part of a peace process plan.” Israeli and Palestinian foreign ministers should be separately invited to EU meetings “to maintain the dialogue with both.”

But in the region, talk of a two-state solution conjures up images of years of diplomatic failures, and for many in mourning it’s simply too early to talk about peace."

1146577531,20231215,"(JNS) — On Nov. 22, Geert Wilders and his Partij voor de Vrijheid, “Party for Freedom,” burst out of the Netherlands’ political wilderness with a resounding electoral victory. Now endeavoring to cobble together a governing coalition, Wilders observed, “The PVV is a broad popular party. The largest in the Netherlands. 2.4 million people voted for us. Highly and poorly educated, native and immigrant, workers, retirees, young people and the elderly. From the city, the countryside. The PVV is for everyone.”

Just prior to the election, the Dutch Centrum Informatie En Documentatie Israel summarized PVV’s record on Israel and antisemitism, including these unique declarations:
• The Dutch embassy in Israel must be moved to Jerusalem.
• Jordan is the only true Palestinian state and PVV does not favor the creation of another one.
• Support for Israeli settlements in Judea and Samaria.
• Opposition to the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam, which is subordinated to Sharia law.
• A commitment to fighting antisemitism, as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, and particularly as promulgated “from an Islamic point of view.”

The commitment to fight antisemitism couldn’t be more timely given the over eight-fold increase in antisemitic incidents in the Netherlands since Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre.

When CIDI’s annual report for 2019 was released, showing the highest number of antisemitic incidents since 1982, Wilders inveighed against the denial of the report’s findings, saying, “It is almost nauseating. We’ve been talking about antisemitism, here in the Lower House, for 10 minutes now. And nobody, really nobody has discussed the biggest cause of antisemitism, which is of course Islam and Islamization”

“We have a million Muslims in the Netherlands right now,” he noted, and “Islam is synonymous with Jew-hatred.” Wilders demonstrated that “intrinsic” Islamic antisemitism is based on the Quran: “In the Quran, it says that Jews are monkeys and pigs (5:60). That they are bad (5:79). That they cannot be trusted (5:13). That they are liars (2:100). That they are dishonest (3:78).”

Wilders concluded by demanding that his colleagues acknowledge “there is a connection between mass immigration of people from Islamic countries and antisemitism. … If you do not, you are selling politically correct nonsense.”

Wilders’s claim is proved by hard data on antisemitic attitudes and non-lethal antisemitic violence and threats in Western Europe.

The 2008 “Six Countries Study” (covering the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, Austria and Sweden) with approximately 9,000 participants (3,373 native Christians; 3,344 Turkish Muslim immigrants; and 2,204 Moroccan Muslim immigrants) revealed that 45 percent of Muslim immigrants versus 9 percent of native Christians believed “Jews cannot be trusted.” While such hostility to Jews among “fundamentalist” Christians doubled to approximately 18 percent, over 70 percent of fundamentalist Muslims were hostile to Jews.

“Antisemitism in Brussels’ Schools,” a 426 page study, included data on the young Belgian Muslim community, primarily 12 to 18-year-olds, in 2011. A 354 page follow-up study of Antwerp-Ghent youth was published in 2013. 2,837 students in 32 Dutch-speaking Brussels high schools were surveyed. Muslim respondents agreed with the following four statements at 3.7-fold to seven-fold rates over non-Muslims:

2) “Most Jews think they’re better than others” (Muslims, 47.1 percent; non-Muslims, 12.9 percent).

3) “If you do business with Jews, you should be extra careful” (Muslims, 47.5 percent; non-Muslims, 12.9 percent).

4) “Jews incite to war and blame others” (Muslims, 53.7 percent; non-Muslims, 7.7 percent). Muslim antisemitism was unrelated to lack of education or social disadvantage.

The 2013 study of 863 students from Ghent and Antwerp, including 346 Muslim students, confirmed these results. 45-50 percent of Muslim students evidenced antisemitic attitudes, versus 10 percent of non-Muslims. A 2011 study by Muslim convert Gunther Jikeli yielded similar results. Jikeli conducted 117 interviews with Muslims from Berlin, Paris and London whose mean age was 19. Jikeli affirmed that “references to the Quran or the Hadith” were central to shaping the antisemitic views of young Muslim adults in Western Europe.

Anti-Defamation League surveys conducted in Belgium, Spain, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and France in 2015 and repeated in 2019 assessed the prevalence of “extreme antisemitism”—defined as agreement with at least six out of 11 antisemitic stereotypes—among Christians/non-Muslims and Muslims. Both surveys revealed that “extreme antisemitism” among Muslims was three times higher than among non-Muslims. ADL studies of Belgium and France published in May of this year were identical. Among French Muslims, it was 62 percent versus 15 percent among French Christians. In Belgium, it was 52 percent versus 21 percent.

Finally, a study of non-lethal violence and violent threats targeting Jews conducted by the European Union for Fundamental Rights in 2012 queried Jewish victims about the identity of the perpetrators: “Thinking about the incident where somebody attacked or threatened you in a way that frightened you because you are Jewish–who did this to you?” Muslims were responsible for 2.2 times more incidents than non-Muslims.

In an Oct. 2013 interview, Al-Azhar University Grand Imam Ahmad al-Tayeb—essentially the Sunni Muslim pope—concentrating on Quran 5:82, authoritatively reaffirmed the canonical Islamic animus that fuels this global orgy of Muslim Jew-hatred and violence.

When no religious or political leader of stature criticized al-Tayeb, I appealed to Geert Wilders. Wilders alone not only rebuked al-Tayeb’s statements, but extolled their polar opposite: Pope Francis’s Evangelii Gaudium, which, Wilders noted, drew “the world’s attention to the indebtedness of Christianity to the Jews and their faith” and contained a “sharp condemnation of the terrible persecutions which the Jews have endured from Christians in the past.”

An alleged post-Oct. 7 epiphany has occurred among the liberal Jewish intelligentsia, embodied in journalist Bari Weiss and her much ballyhooed Oct. 11 Federalist Society speech. Weiss proclaimed, “Look at your enemies and your allies. … I know that in the fight for the West, I know who my allies are.”

I maintain that unequivocal support for Wilders and the PVV—who are bold, informed truthtellers on Islam and the Jews—is a litmus test of the “post-Oct. 7” sincerity of the liberal Jewish intelligentsia."

Australia, Belgium Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, France, Ireland Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom express their grave concern about the record number of attacks by extremist settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. Since the start of October, settlers have committed more than 287 violent attacks, killing 8 Palestinian civilians, injuring more than 73, and forcing more than 1,149 Palestinians from their homes.

We strongly condemn the violent acts committed by extremist settlers, which are terrorising Palestinian communities. We reiterate our position that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law and remind Israel of its obligations under international law, in particular Article 49 of Geneva Convention IV.

This rise in extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians is unacceptable. Israel, as the occupying power, must protect the Palestinian civilian population in the West Bank. Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice. Israel’s failure to protect Palestinians and prosecute extremist settlers has led to an environment of near complete impunity in which settler violence has reached unprecedented levels. This undermines security in the West Bank and the region and threatens prospects for a lasting peace.

While we welcomed the Government of Israel’s statement on this issue on 9 November where it conveyed that action would be taken against violent perpetrators, proactive steps must now be taken to ensure the effective and immediate protection of Palestinian communities. Words are important, but must now be translated into action."

1146602740,20231215,"TikTok has recently seen a surge in a new challenge that could have serious legal consequences, particularly in the state of Louisiana. While challenges are often harmless and entertaining, the ""112 Challenge"" involving iPhone users and Siri is causing more harm than amusement.

What is the 112 Challenge?

The premise of the ""112 Challenge"" revolves around iPhone users instructing Siri by saying, ""Siri, one twelve."" This command triggers a three-second countdown before the phone automatically dials 911, the emergency services number. This feature is designed to swiftly aid individuals in distress during emergencies, but unfortunately, it has been misused in the latest TikTok trend.

The Problem with this TikTok trend

In Louisiana, this challenge has resulted in several teenagers facing legal repercussions, including arrests. The misuse of this iPhone feature falls under the scope of Louisiana law, particularly §285 of the state's legal code pertaining to telephone communications and improper use. This statute clearly outlines what constitutes unlawful behavior regarding phone usage, encompassing various actions, including using obscene or indecent language, harassing or intimidating others through phone calls, and making repeated communications with the intent to annoy or offend.

Participants engaging in the ""112 Challenge"" are potentially violating these laws by misusing emergency services, creating a false alarm, and potentially causing disruptions to emergency responders. Not only does this challenge pose a risk of fines and imprisonment, but it can also tie up vital emergency lines, diverting resources from genuine crises and potentially putting lives in danger.

This law states that violating these provisions can result in penalties, including fines up to five hundred dollars and imprisonment for up to six months for the first offense. Subsequent offenses could lead to more severe consequences, with fines reaching up to five thousand dollars and imprisonment for up to two years.

It's imperative to educate teenagers and TikTok users about the serious legal implications and risks associated with partaking in such challenges. Emphasizing the importance of responsible use of technology, especially concerning emergency services, is crucial in preventing unnecessary legal troubles and ensuring the safety of the community."

1146621528,20231216,"From the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the U.S. government has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine’s war effort. The Biden administration has repeatedly produced emergency spending packages to support the Ukrainian government and military. That funding has so far amounted to US$113 billion.

But public opinion polls suggest that Americans’ support for Ukraine was waning even before Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel and the ensuing Israel-Hamas war drew international attention away from Ukraine.

Political scientist Jessica Trisko Darden, author of “Aiding and Abetting: U.S. Foreign Assistance and State Violence,” explains how recent efforts by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to hold up aid to Ukraine reflects the perception that the U.S. is spending too much money on Ukraine at the expense of other domestic priorities, such as increased security at the U.S. southern border.

1. How much aid has the US provided to Ukraine so far?

So far, the U.S. has approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine through four supplemental emergency appropriations, which are a way of requesting funds outside of the normal budgetary process. The majority of this aid has been for military purposes.

The more than $62.3 billion provided in military assistance includes at least $23.5 billion worth of U.S. weapons from the Department of Defense. In contrast, about $3 billion has been for humanitarian assistance.

Advocates for increased U.S. aid have pointed out that much of the military assistance to Ukraine actually supports the U.S. defense industry. Those advocates also argue that the war in Ukraine is devastating Russia’s military assets, and the current approach is much cheaper than facing an expansionist Russia.

But critics argue that the unprecedented amounts of U.S. military aid to Ukraine are draining U.S. military stockpiles and potentially degrading military readiness.

Others have called for additional oversight for aid to Ukraine, given the country’s history of government corruption.

2. What aid is the Biden administration currently requesting for Ukraine?

The current request before the House includes $105 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the U.S. southern border, with more than $61 billion of the package for Ukraine.

In comparison, $6.4 billion is being requested for U.S. border operations.

This aid package is separate from the defense appropriations bill passed by the Senate on Dec. 13 and the House on Dec. 14, which includes $600 million in military aid for Ukraine and funding for the creation of a special inspector general to oversee aid to Ukraine. That bill awaits President Joe Biden’s signature.

Voting on the special funding request was initially delayed by the ouster of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But current Speaker Mike Johnson has done little to advance a vote, despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s December 2023 meetings in Washington, D.C., with Biden and members of Congress to plead for more assistance.

3. What is the reason for the current congressional holdup?

The House Republican leadership has refused to pass the Biden administration’s emergency aid bill without additional commitments for increased security at the southern border of the U.S.

Some lawmakers remain opposed to an additional emergency spending bill and would rather see this Ukraine aid integrated into the regular budgetary process in 2024. Regardless of the reasoning, with Congress’ holiday recess fast approaching, it is unlikely that the current impasse will be resolved before 2024.

4. What will Ukraine do if it doesn’t get US aid?

One option is for Ukraine to seek increased contributions from other supportive nations.

So far, 46 countries have provided some form of military aid to Ukraine. Those countries include the U.K., France and Germany, as well as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Bulgaria.

Japan has contributed more than $7 billion in economic assistance during the war. In all, the European Union has provided the lion’s share of financial assistance at almost $80 billion.

But no other country has the military resources at its disposal to even come close to matching the level of military assistance that Congress is currently considering. Further delay in U.S. military assistance, or a radical decrease in the amount proposed, will have significant impacts on Ukraine’s ability to fight the war.

5. Where do the presidential candidates stand on Ukraine aid?

While Biden, of course, is a strong supporter of Ukraine, Republican presidential candidates have been airing a wide range of views on additional aid to Ukraine.

Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley is a strong supporter of U.S. aid to Ukraine, for example, while former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are against it.

Even if the Russia-Ukraine war ends in 2024, congressional debates over assistance to Ukraine will continue, no matter who is elected president. That’s because the U.S. is likely to be one of the primary donors helping to rebuild Ukraine, which already has suffered an estimated $150 billion in war-related damage.

In a joint statement with 13 other nations including France and the United Kingdom, Australia condemned what was described as ""record high"" violence from extremist settlers.

Since the start of October, settlers have committed more than 340 violent attacks against Palestinian people in the West Bank, the statement said.

Eight Palestinian civilians have been killed, more than 80 have been injured and 1026 people forced out of their homes.

""We reiterate our position that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law and remind Israel of its obligations under international law,"" the statement said.

But Australia and the other nations said proactive steps must be taken to ensure the immediate protection of Palestinian communities.

""Effective and immediate action is needed to ensure civilians are protected, perpetrators are held to account and tensions are not inflamed further,"" she posted on X, formerly Twitter.

The latest upsurge in a long history of violence in the region was sparked when fighters from Hamas - considered a terrorist group by the Australian government - crossed a border fence into southern Israel, killing 1200 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostages on October 7."

And in Brussels, Hungary has blocked the European Union from approving a financial package that would send more than $50 billion to Kyiv. After a week of touring international capitals, pleading for help, Ukraine's president finally came home with only one small victory, though a significant one. Joining us now from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, is NPR's Joanna Kakissis. Hi there.

SUMMERS: So, Joanna, let's just start with this money for Ukraine that the European Union failed to approve. Why is Hungary refusing to sign off, and can just one vote really hold everything up?

KAKISSIS: Yeah. In the European Union, all 27 member states must agree on actions before they're authorized. And in this case, the action involved the EU budget, which includes about 50 billion euros in loans and grants to Ukraine over several years. And Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban refused to support it. He is Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest ally in the EU, and Orban told reporters that he does not want Hungarian taxpayers to support a war that he believes Ukraine can't win.

PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN: (Through interpreter) We shouldn't send more money to finance the war. We should stop the war and have peace talks. Instead, they want to give money to keep the war going.

KAKISSIS: And by they, he means the other 26 leaders of European Union member nations, most of whom are very vocal supporters of Ukraine and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And when Orban talks about peace talks - he said this before - the implication is that the Ukrainians should just accept the land that they've lost to Russia in this war and just move on.

SUMMERS: Now, the Ukrainians did have one significant victory from the summit. It's that European leaders agreed to open negotiations for the country to join the EU. So why didn't Hungary block this action?

KAKISSIS: So, Juana, it looks like Viktor Orban actually abstained from voting in this case. And according to some news reports, he was actually told to leave the room while the other leaders voted on this. Orban said later in a Facebook video that he doesn't think Ukraine is ready for membership and that he left the room because he didn't want to participate in what he calls a bad decision. Now, Orban has threatened for days that he's going to block this, and Zelenskyy actually tried talking to him earlier this week in Argentina, where they were both attending the new president's inauguration there. The exchange was caught on video, and it looked really testy. So a reporter asked Zelenskyy about it when Zelenskyy was in Oslo a couple of days ago.

PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: He has no any reasons to block Ukrainian membership in EU, and I asked him to tell me one reason. I'm waiting for answer.

KAKISSIS: Now, Orban has said that he has actually not given up on blocking those membership talks in the future. He says after all, the Hungarian Parliament, where his party has all the power they must also approve it.

SUMMERS: So, Joanna, what happens next with both these membership talks and also the aid?

KAKISSIS: So, Juana, EU membership negotiations often take years, so it's not like Ukraine is going to join the EU tomorrow. But this was a big symbolic victory for Ukraine. Ukraine has been working very hard on reforming its institutions and fighting corruption in the middle of a war so it can qualify for European Union membership and definitively break from this Russian and Soviet domination that they had in the past. As for the Ukraine aid package, EU leaders say they are going to meet again early next month with the goal of passing it. But at this very moment, Western support - you know, it seems very uncertain. And that's exactly as Russia's President Vladimir Putin predicted.

SUMMERS: NPR's Joanna Kakissis in Kyiv. Thank you.

1146730152,20231216,"The Council of the European Union and the European Parliament have reached a provisional agreement on a new law to safeguard media freedom, media pluralism and editorial independence in the EU.

The European media freedom act (EMFA) will establish a common framework for media services in the EU’s internal market and introduce measures aimed at protecting journalists and media providers from political interference, while also making it easier for them to operate across the EU’s internal borders. The new rules will guarantee the right of citizens to access free and plural information and define the responsibility of member states to provide the appropriate conditions and framework to protect it.

The negotiations between the two co-legislators, which were launched on 19 October 2023, have been concluded at the political level with today's agreement.

The proposed regulation responds to rising concerns in the EU about the politicisation of the media, as well as the lack of transparency about media ownership and allocation of state advertising funds to media service providers. It aims to put safeguards in place to combat political interference in editorial decisions for both private and public service media providers, protect journalists and their sources, and guarantee media freedom and pluralism.

Media freedom and pluralism are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights. However, recent reports from the Commission and the media pluralism monitor have highlighted a number of concerns in the EU regarding issues such as the politicisation of the media, transparency of media ownership and the independence of media regulators.

The EMFA builds on the provisions of the 2018 audiovisual media services directive, broadening its scope to include radio and press. In particular, it introduces an independent European board for media services, that will be composed of national media authorities and will advise and support the Commission to promote the consistent application of key provisions of the new EMFA law and the AVMSD in all member states, including by providing opinions and helping the Commission to produce guidelines.

The compromise text provisionally agreed between the co-legislators maintains the ambition and objectives of the Commission’s proposal while ensuring that the new law is consistent with existing EU legislation, respects national competences in this area, and strikes the right balance between the necessary harmonisation and respect for national differences.

In particular, the provisional agreement clarifies member states’ responsibility to guarantee the plurality, independence and proper functioning of public media providers operating within their borders. It also sets out the obligation for member states to guarantee the effective protection of journalists and media providers in the exercise of their professional activity and prohibits member states from using coercive measures to obtain information about journalists’ sources or confidential communications except in specified cases.

The compromise text broadens the scope of the requirements on transparency, both for transparency of ownership, which is proposed to apply for all media service providers, and for the transparency of state advertising where the possibility of national exemptions for small entities is significantly reduced. It also provides clearer rules on the relationship between very large online platform providers and media service providers.

The deal with the Parliament determines the scope of the Board in its advisory role and strengthens its independence. It also introduces the possibility for the Board to set up a steering group, as well as to consult media representatives on issues beyond the scope of the audiovisual media sector.

Member states will be able to adopt stricter or more detailed rules than those set out in relevant parts of the EMFA.

The provisional agreement must now be endorsed by the Council and the Parliament once the text has been finalised at technical level. It will then be formally adopted by both institutions in the spring of 2024.

The degree of support or opposition to the European Media Freedom Act varies among Member States, ranging from general support with slight reservations on the part of Portugal and the Netherlands, to a critical assessment by France, Belgium, and Denmark. Germany has registered its opposition to the act."
