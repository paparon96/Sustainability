Out of the humanitarian aid, 3.5 million euros will be allocated for vulnerable Lebanese and 11.5 million for displaced Syrians, covering those displaced internally and those seeking asylum in Lebanon, as announced by the European Commission on Friday.

The aid will allow the provision of food, water, sanitation, and hygiene support for those who need them most, said the European Commission.

In a statement carried by Lebanon's National News Agency, the ministry thanked the EU for its continued commitment to alleviating the suffering of the most vulnerable Lebanese.

It also expressed hope for dialogue and cooperation to reach sustainable solutions for safely returning Syrian refugees in Lebanon to their homeland as early as possible.

Lebanon remains the country hosting the largest number of refugees per capita, with the government estimating around 1.5 million Syrian refugees living in Lebanon.

Lebanon has been trying to negotiate with relevant countries about the need to return Syrian refugees to their homeland as the crisis-hit country said it could no longer host a large number of displaced people on its territory."

It was world news last week when Moldovan President Maia Sandu’s pup bit Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen’s hand at a tripartite summit with Slovenia, called to discuss Moldova’s entry into the European Union. Luckily, the elderly Austrian was no Hitler, Stalin or Dollfuss who, if treated so like a dog, would have blocked Moldova’s EU entry. He was forgiving, and gifted the excitable pup a toy.

Diplomacy is going to the dogs. Vladimir Putin boasted to visiting George W. Bush that his Labrador retriever Konni was “bigger, stronger and faster” than Bush’s Scottish terrier. He even set Konni upon Angela Merkel, who hated dogs. Joe Biden’s and Boris Johnson’s dogs have mounted on their guards and guests, though bites of the kind that van der Bellen suffered at Chisinau haven’t been reported from Downing Street or the Kremlin.

Unless on a tight leash, dogs can mar political ties. Among the many grouses that Deve Gowda had against Congress president Sitaram Kesri, which led to the fall of the Gowda regime, was that Kesri used to let his Pomeranian roam free in the room even when the two were talking matters of state. More recently, Himanta Biswa Sarma was peeved that Rahul Gandhi was paying more attention to feeding his dog Pidi when he called on the latter, than to his litany of grievances from Assam. Sarma walked out without even a canine whine, and smelled his way into the BJP. Since then it has been dog days for the Congress in the northeast.

India’s current concern is not about such topdogs, but about dogs who bite people like us, the underdogs. Open the city pages of your morning paper, and you will see stories aplenty about street dogs biting morning strollers, neighbour’s terrier biting kid in a lift, a corporate honcho dying of head injury sustained while fleeing street dogs, and more. Every bite takes a few bytes on the news television, too, where you may even hear the cries of the bitten, and the barks of dog lovers who resist efforts to end the street dog menace.

‘Dog bites man’ is national news. A town council in Kerala, fed up with ill-fed dogs biting morning strollers and shocked by a stray dog mauling an autistic child to death, moved the court seeking to strike down Maneka Gandhi’s animal birth control (ABC) rules, and seeking powers to kill, cull or curb street dogs. The Punjab and Haryana High court ordered the state to pay Rs10,000 for every dog tooth that had entered the flesh of a man, and Rs20,000 for every 0.2 cm of torn flesh.

Earlier, municipalities were allowed to mercy-kill dogs so that town roads and parks could be kept safe. In 2001 Maneka, then a junior minister in the A.B. Vajpayee government, notified the ABC rules which disallowed dog-catching and mercy-killing, both of which had been allowed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals act. Under the rules, amended minorly this year, street dogs who bite can at the most be caught and vaccinated, but have to be set back into streets.

Six crore dogs—the “mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound, and curs of low degree,” as Oliver Goldsmith put it in An Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog—are currently stalking our streets, giving wounds “both sore and sad” to two crore Indians every year. Dog-bite rabies is killing more Indians than is malaria, yet animal lovers wouldn’t hear of even a mad mongrel being killed.

The irony, says the kill-the-mad-dog lobby, is: it is lawful to kill a man-eating tiger in rare cases, but you can land in jail if you kill a mad dog."

Greener shipping: China can bolster global climate change fight by using biofuel in ships instead of exporting it, Dutch start-up 123Carbon says

China, a major exporter, can do more by using low-carbon fuel in Chinese ocean-going vessels instead of exporting it, according to Holland-based 123Carbon. Doing so would allow the global shipping industry to cut the emissions and costs arising from the shipping of biofuels, said Jeroen van Heiningen, managing director and co-founder of the transport carbon emissions reduction registry operator. Cargo owners could use digital technology to account and pay for carbon emission reduction benefits, he added. The company, formed in 2021, launched a digital registry in January for marine, air and road transport carbon reduction initiatives. Its platform aims to allow low-carbon fuel suppliers and shipping companies to issue, manage and sell externally verified emissions reduction certificates, which can be used by cargo owners and freight forwarders to make reduction claims on their supply-chain emissions. “We are working on appointing an agent to bring knowledge to the China market, because we see strong opportunities here,” van Heiningen told the Post. “China has strong capacity in biofuel production, and it can deliver biomethanol.” , or renewable methanol, is produced from biomass, such as forestry and agricultural waste and municipal wastes. Its combustion carbon footprint is up to 95 per cent lower than that of conventional fossil fuels, according to trade body the Methanol Institute. , or renewable methanol, is produced from biomass, such as forestry and agricultural waste and municipal wastes.

China’s biodiesel production rose by a third to 2.4 billion litres last year from 2021, according to the US Department of Agriculture. It was almost entirely exported to the European Union, especially Holland, which imposed an emissions cap-and-trade system on its road transport sector. Last Thursday, 123Carbon beat five other finalists and won the top prize at this year’s Captain’s Table shipping and logistics innovation ideas pitching competition, held as part of last week’s Hong Kong Maritime Week event. demand is expected to grow, as more companies try to deliver on their targets and demand is expected to grow, as more companies try to deliver on their targets and demand is expected to grow, as more companies try to deliver on their targets and , including those of their logistics suppliers. Last September, a coalition of more than 20 companies, including big consumer goods brands Idea, Philips, Levi’s and Amazon, made requests for proposals to decarbonise sea-freight containers equivalent to about 600,000 twenty-foot equivalent units from 2025. They will pay a “green premium” on shipping costs and contribute towards the higher costs of low-carbon fuels. Currently, due to the lack of a commonly recognised mechanism to account for climate mitigation benefits, it is for container vessel owners and operators to charge cargo owners extra for using lower carbon fuels, or other energy-saving technology such as It is often impossible to physically trace how much carbon reduction was achieved by using biofuel to move a particular cargo in a vessel, Van Heiningen said. Even if a cargo owner wants to pay extra for its cargo to be shipped by a biofuel-fuelled vessel, it is not always possible due to the unavailability of biofuel, he added. “The vast majority of cargo owners are reluctant to pay for biofuel, so we need an allocation mechanism for the climate mitigation benefit from biofuels to be passed on to cargo owners,” he said. 123Carbon’s platform uses blockchain technology to collect and store verifiable, auditable and immutable information related to greenhouse gas emissions reduction activities in the logistics sector. The information is assured by verification, auditing and certification providers Verifavia and Bureau Veritas. China’s carbon emissions can be used to make green fuel, says CMA CGM exec However, this method of tracking, accounting and trading of emissions mitigation benefits has not yet been endorsed by Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which are key international standard setters for tracking corporate decarbonisation initiatives. Such so-called book-and-claim instruments are a topic that requires further research and clarification from greenhouse gas accounting standards, according to SBTi. “SBTi acknowledges that book-and-claim instruments are not well-defined in the market … SBTi is following up and participating in multiple discussion groups working on this topic,” it said in May."
1142557760,20231126,"(MENAFN) United States pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has escalated its feud with Poland over excess Covid-19 vaccine doses that were ordered under a huge contract with the European Union. The company is suing the country over what it claims is an unfulfilled contract for Covid-19 vaccines.

 

 Warsaw was locked into buying tens of millions of doses under a controversial contract the European Commission had signed with Pfizer in 2021 on behalf of European Union nations. 

 

 Pfizer is demanding 6 billion zloty (USD1.5 billion) in compensation for 60 million doses that Poland’s government declined, after it stopped taking delivery of the jabs in April 2022. 

 

 The entire bloc wound up ordering 1.1 billion doses under the contract, saddling European Union states with a vaccine glut as the Covid-19 pandemic waned. The European Union prosecutor’s office has already announced an investigation into the procurement process amid allegations of corruption and secret backroom deals while Polish Health Minister Katarzyna Sojka has warned other European Union states could be next to face prosecution.

 

 Warsaw has questioned the controversial role of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in the Pfizer deal after it emerged she had for weeks privately communicated with the company's CEO Albert Bourla during the contract negotiations. However, the European Commission claimed last year that her text messages with the big pharma boss on deals worth multiple billions of dollars executive could not be found.

 

 The first hearing in Pfizer’s lawsuit is scheduled to take place in Brussels on December 6. Earlier this year the pharma giant offered to give the European Union more time to complete its minimum vaccine purchases under the binding contract, but insisted that the bloc must pay in full for the contractually specified number of doses. Poland since refused to sign a revised European Union agreement with the drugmaker."
