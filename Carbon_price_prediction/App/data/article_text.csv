However, the Bahamas has been largely compliant for decades and the EU still decides to blacklist the country during the recent United Nations general assembly.

Originally, the agreements between the Bahamas and the EU were to ensure fair financial regulations and to prevent terrorists and drug trafficking organisations from using offshore banks as a means of laundering money for illegal activities. On paper, this would be an excellent idea to root out bad actors from the banking sector and to further grow our relationship with Europe. In reality, it's the total opposite.

The Bahamas has been completely compliant with everything the European Union has asked us to do and yet they continuously change the goalposts every few years. Worse, countries like Switzerland and Luxembourg and certain German banks have been operating with lax financial compliance for years and yet they're not blacklisted while the Bahamian financial sector is getting decimated by nonsensical regulations, which are dangerously close to being racially discriminatory as it can get while maintaining a supposedly fair image.

Apparently, all of our KYC (Know your Customer) changes and progress on financial regulations we've made over the last decade has been effectively nullified by the recent blacklist. This cannot stand, because the Bahamas has lost its position in the international financial service industry due to the constant ""regulations"" made by the EU for countries like the Bahamas.

Now it would be a good time for Prime Minister Davis and his administration to seek out answers from Ursula von der Leyen and the rest of the EU. If the organisation is to maintain any good standing with the Bahamas and the Caribbean, then it must enforce fair conduct with all of its member states and other nations who are active participants in the financial services.

If they persist in nonsensical regulations designed to hurt the Bahamas and other Caribbean nations, show favoritism with certain nations over others and use blacklists as economic weapons, then the Bahamas will have to refuse any further compliance from European financial institutions and render the agreements null and void. As much as we want to remain on the good side of our allies, if protecting our secondary industry requires to go to extreme measures, then so be it."
1066608839,20221008,"A week ago, I worried that the anti-regime demonstrations in Iran might falter if the mostly young protesters didn’t get some help from grown-ups — like the trade unions, say, or the so-called moderate elements within the theocratic state. I reckoned it would take the participation of groups of that stature to rattle Ali Khamenei, the Islamic Republic’s ruthless supreme leader.

The adults have not yet risen to the occasion, but the tyrant and his theocrats have been confronted and confounded by an unexpected constituency: schoolgirls. They represent a new kind of challenge for a regime that usually deals with dissent by licensing its security forces to use torture and murder. Does Khamenei dare turn his thugs on children?

Now in its third week, the protests have evolved from an expression of disgust over the death of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of Iran’s notorious morality police. Women continue to dominate the demonstrations, but they are no longer content merely to burn their hijabs, or headscarves, in symbolic opposition to the regime’s restrictive dress code. Now, they are calling for the dismantling of the entire theocratic edifice of the state.

Their ranks have been joined by schoolgirls, who are likewise calling for the downfall of the regime. Video clips of girls confronting teachers and officials in classrooms are proliferating on social media, despite the government’s efforts to impose a communications blackout. In some clips, the kids can be heard chanting “Death to the dictator,” and stomping on images of Khamenei — and even of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Even for a regime practiced in the dark arts of dissimulation, these videos are hard to reconcile with its usual dismissal of dissent as the work of foreign actors. Per usual, Khamenei is blaming the protests on the U.S. and Israel, but he will struggle to explain how they managed to reach into the classrooms, past the minders appointed by the state, to pollute the minds of children.

Demonstrations have also spread across university campuses across the country, accelerating after a bloody crackdown on protesters at Tehran’s Sharif University. Beating down on college students is practically routine for the regime, however, and Iranians are all too familiar with images of carnage in the campus, especially from 1999, when Khamenei unleashed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij militia against students protesting censorship.

But the supreme leader has never set his attack dogs upon schoolkids — not yet, anyway. Will the IRGC and Basij balk at clubbing children into submission, especially given the risk that their actions will be caught on cellphone cameras and shown to the wide world?

They must know that the world is paying attention. In the U.S., Canada, Europe and Turkey, there have been rallies in solidarity with the Iranian protesters. Their signature slogan — “Women! Life! Freedom!” — has been taken up in Afghanistan, where women are fighting their own battles against misogynistic rulers.

World leaders are watching, too. Having already announced sanctions against the morality police and other regime officials, President Biden has announced he will impose “further costs” on those responsible for violence against the protesters. The European Union is considering sanctions requests from Germany, France, Denmark, Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic.

Any action against schoolkids will undoubtedly invite harsher penalties, such as expulsion of diplomats and barring Iran from international forums. Even allies like China and Russia will find it hard to back Tehran in those circumstances."
1066609936,20221008,"This executive summary report by Eurodad is part of a joint publication coordinated by Bread for the World and the Heinrich Böll Stiftung (Washington DC Office) which includes regional reports from Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe, India, Indonesia, The Philippines and Peru. It presents the state of play of public-private partnerships in the energy sector and demonstrates why they are a risky business.

The world is going through a major energy emergency that has seen the price of basic rights, such as heating homes, soar to levels that many people simply cannot afford. A combination of factors, including the war in Ukraine, financial speculation in commodities by investors and profiteering by energy companies, have added to the impact of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. While access to energy has always been an issue associated with emerging and developing countries, developed countries now face the unprecedented threat of unaffordable energy prices. However, even with the widening gulf of inequality in developed countries, it is apparent that developing countries are in a far worse situation. A major impact of the energy crisis is food insecurity. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations’ 2022 Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC 2022), in 2021 alone, around 193 million people in 53 countries experienced acute food insecurity.3 This figure is set to rise unless the drivers of food insecurity, including energy prices, are effectively regulated.

In response to this growing crisis, and with the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in mind, specifically SDG-7, which aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for gas, wind, hydroelectric power, solar energy and coal projects has been the preferred model for the UN and other international financial institutions (IFIs). A recent example of energy PPP implementation is the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) 6th International PPP Forum. The forum reinstated its ongoing support for the global promotion of PPPs as a means for achieving sustainable infrastructure.

At the same time, the support, endorsement and promotion of PPPs by IFIs and other multilateral institutions has been consistently critiqued by civil society organisations (CSOs) for a lack of evidence on the grounds of cost effectiveness, efficiency and transparency, as well as extensive cases of human rights abuses.

Following an abundance of research and advocacy by CSOs and activists from around the world, this report provides a critical analysis of the role and operation of energy PPP projects, based on analyses of eight PPP energy case reports from countries of the Global South: Africa: Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe; Asia: India, Indonesia, The Philippines; Latin America: Peru.

1066617128,20221008,"On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities, which provides a new framework for legal data transfers between the European Union and the United States. The legal basis for transatlantic data transfers has been uncertain since 2020, when the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) declared the previous framework, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, invalid under EU law.

The Executive Order seeks to address the ECJ’s concerns with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield by providing stronger protections to EU residents against U.S. intelligence activities. In particular, the Executive Order restricts U.S. intelligence agencies’ processing of EU data subjects’ personal data to the activities necessary and proportionate to advance a national security purpose. In addition, the Executive Order requires the U.S. to establish a two-tier redress mechanism to address complaints of alleged violations, whereby the Office of the Director of National Intelligence would first conduct an initial investigation to assess qualifying claims and potential remedies, and an independent Data Protection Review Court would render binding decisions on such complaints. The framework will now undergo a ratification process by the European Data Protection Board, the European Parliament and the European Commission. Following ratification by the European Commission, the Executive Order is expected to become operative in March 2023."
1066625349,20220908,"It is a stinker in terms of policy, and unconvincing in effect, but the wholesale, indiscriminate retention of telecommunications data continues to excite legislators and law enforcement. In the European Union, countries continue to debate and pursue such measures, despite legal challenges.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), passed in 2016, limits the ways personal data is collected in terms of legitimate purposes. The European Court of Justice has also made it clear that the mass retention of phone and location data violates the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Human Rights.

Despite this, EU member states continue to subvert, by varying degrees, such protections. Fixated by notions of protecting society from the unsavoury and the criminal, lawmakers continue to flirt and court the mass surveillance properties inherent in such regulations.

A neatly grim example of this arose in July, when the Belgian parliament passed laws mandating the retention of user data by telecommunications and internet providers. This was a second run by the parliament, given the invalidation in April 2021 by the Belgian Constitutional Court of the previous data retention law. That particular statute permitted the storage of every Belgian’s telecom, location and internet metadata for up to 12 months. Those behind the new law, such as the Minister of Justice Vincent Van Quickenborne, claim it to be a targeted measure that preserves privacy; in truth it permits general data surveillance.

In Germany, the debate has been particularly strident. In 2010, the Constitutional Court annulled the first data retention law. Five years later, data retention was re-introduced, though not implemented given court rulings.

Despite arguments favouring its implementation, the investigation and prosecution of crime could still take place with high degrees of success without any such regime in place. In January this year, the statistics on crime clearance rates published by the German government revealed than a mere 3% of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) investigations between 2017 and 2021 could not be pursued for want of records of IP addresses.

The current coalition agreement, while supporting the retention of communications data, specifies that it be done “on an ad-hoc basis” and only via judicial order. But the Social Democratic Minister of the Interior, Nancy Faeser, is a steadfast devotee of such retention, a fan of indiscriminate surveillance.

Faeser and her surveillance fan club got an answer last month with the ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that Germany’s general data retention law breached EU law. The case was triggered by action taken by Deutsche Telekom unit Telekom Deutschland and the internet service provider SpaceNet AG. The CJEU’s opinion was duly sought by the German court. The judges duly found that “EU law precludes the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data, except in the case of a serious threat to national security.”

The court took issue with the law’s “broad set of traffic and location data” retention requirements to be kept over periods of 10 weeks and four weeks respectively. This could lead to “very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of persons whose data are retained, such as habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them and, in particular, enable a profile of those persons to be established.”

The CJEU did not do away with the idea of bulk data retention, merely noting a growing list of exceptions that states are bound to exploit. In the German case, specific contexts might involve a grave threat to national security. There would also have to be court oversight, discrimination in terms of targeting, and a specific period of time.

In another joined case, the CJEU found that financial market regulators cannot use EU laws to target insider dealing and market manipulation by forcing telecom providers to supply the personal data of suspect traders to the authorities. The French law in question, justified on the basis of fighting crime, permitted the retention of such traffic data for up to one year from the day of its recording.

National legislation requiring telecommunications operators “to retain generally and indiscriminately the traffic data of all users of means of electronic communication, with no differentiation in that regard or with no provision made for exceptions and without establishing the link required […] between the data to be retained and the objective pursued” fell outside what was “strictly necessary and cannot be considered to be justified, in a democratic society”.

While European judicial bodies with teeth rein in the way data retention is used, when and if it should even be permitted, countries such as Australia continue to show faith in the very idea. Last month’s hack of the country’s second largest telecoms company, Optus, was a reminder that unnecessary data retention measures are an incitement for unlawful access.

In 2015, when the Data Retention Bill was introduced, advocates and those in the telecommunications industry had reason to be worried. In testimony to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Telstra Director of Government Relations, James Shaw, noted that the telco’s practice over peak times such as New Year’s Eve was to only retain some data for a few hours before being overwritten. This was markedly shorter than the Bill’s proposed two-year retention period.

Telstra’s Chief Information Security Officer Michael Burgess also issued a warning that such legislative requirements would embolden hackers. “We would have to put extra measures in place … to make sure that data was safe from those that should not have access to it.”

Electronic Frontiers Australia Executive Office Jon Lawrence was even more trenchant in explaining to the Joint Committee that such data retention requirements were an “unnecessary and disproportionate invasion of privacy” and would “literally be a honeypot to organised crime, to any sort of person who can potentially access it”.

Despite such warnings, the Joint Committee approved the bill, subject to a number of vague and ineffectual recommendations about security and appropriate data use. This has left those in Australia vulnerable to data loss and unprotected by the woefully inadequate Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). But even the European example shows us that the forces of law and order remain attritive in their efforts to undermine rights and liberties via requirements for data storage. Even in the face of judicial rulings and precedents, the attempt to maintain mass surveillance through data retention regimes remains a burning, threatening issue."

JERUSALEM (AP) — ​​The Israeli military on Thursday cleared itself of wrongdoing in the death of a 7-year-old Palestinian boy whose family says he “died of fear” after an encounter with Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank.

The United States, European Union and United Nations had demanded an investigation into the death of second-grader Rayan Suleiman, which became the latest lightning rod in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as outraged Palestinians blamed Israel for his death last week.

Rayan’s parents allege he was chased by Israeli soldiers on his way home from school and that he collapsed when troops appeared at his home in the Palestinian town of Tequa. They say he fell unconscious after troops interrogated his father and threatened Rayan and his brothers with arrest.

Doctors who treated Rayan said a preliminary examination showed Rayan experienced cardiac arrest induced by what could be described as a severe panic attack. A Palestinian hospital said it had conducted an autopsy but its findings have not yet been made public.

Israel closed its investigation into his death on Thursday, denying any violence in the encounter between Israeli soldiers and Rayan’s family and saying the “soldiers acted as expected of them, while adhering to the (army’s) values.”

Israeli military investigations have long drawn criticism from rights groups and Palestinians who charge that they are not independent or effective, citing a low indictment rate. The military insists the system works.

In its probe into Rayan’s death, the army said one of its commanders searched several houses in Tequa for suspects who had fled after hurling stones at motorists last week.

It said the soldier summoned Rayan’s father with his two children to their doorstep for interrogation last Thursday, describing the encounter as a conversation “held in a respectful manner, without any form of physical contact and certainly without the use of verbal or physical violence.”

The troops next saw the father in a car with his son on his lap, the army said, noting that it found “no evidence” Rayan suffered physical damage as the result of Israeli military activity.

Hundreds of people attended Rayan’s funeral last Friday, and his death struck a nerve with Palestinian parents. Fear for their children’s safety and the dread of soldiers knocking on the door are part of daily life under an entrenched Israeli military rule that is now in its 56th year. Human rights groups say Israeli soldiers routinely arrest children and teenagers during night raids.

Rayan’s death came as violence escalates in the occupied West Bank, where nearly half a million Israeli settlers live on land that Palestinians want for a future independent state. Israel has conducted arrest raids almost every night since a series of deadly Palestinian attacks in Israel last spring. The incursions have killed over 100 Palestinians this year — a seven-year high.

Most of those killed are said by Israel to have been militants, but local youths protesting the incursions as well as some civilians have also died in the violence."
1066646762,20221008,"A United Nations organization on Friday committed to sharply cut carbon emissions from air travel by 2050 in response to growing pressure for airlines to reduce their pollution.

Several major environmental groups praised the move, saying it could encourage the production of more sustainable aviation fuel. But they cautioned that it will be difficult to push countries to follow up with policies that actually reduce emissions.

Aviation is a relatively small contributor to overall climate-changing emissions, but its share is expected to grow. More people are expected to travel on planes in the coming years, and aviation lacks cleaner alternatives such as electric power that are rapidly becoming widely available for cars and trucks.

On Friday in Montreal, representatives of nearly 200 nations in the U.N.’s International Civil Aviation Organization adopted what the agency called an “aspirational goal” of reaching “net zero” emissions by 2050.

The decision capped nearly a decade of negotiations and occurred as aviation comes under more pressure to fall in line with conditions of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate, which aims to cap the rise in global temperature. Crucially, the U.N. agency's resolution does not set targets for individual countries or airlines.

Mark Brownstein, a senior official at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the resolution raised hope that travel will be more sustainable. “But the work isn’t over,” he said. “Now is the time for countries to act by establishing policies that support achievement of a 2050 net-zero goal for aviation with measurable progress in the interim.”

Dan Rutherford, who tracks the issue for the International Council on Clean Transportation, said that to hit the net-zero target, aviation emissions will need to peak and start decreasing as soon as 2025, “with richer countries taking the lead.”

Airlines and governments expect to greatly reduce emissions by gradually switching from kerosene-based jet fuel to fuels made from fats, grease, plants or renewables. The European Union has proposed higher taxes on fossil fuels including jet fuel. But reaching net zero could require tougher measures including limits on flights – at least until large electric- or hydrogen-powered planes are feasible decades from now.

Airlines for America said it applauded the U.N. group's resolution, which could avoid a patchwork of policies by individual countries. The industry trade group called the 2050 milestone “ambitious,” but said airlines are already working with the U.S. government to make 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel available by 2030."
1066646763,20221008,"BAKHMUT, Ukraine - Russian forces said Friday they captured ground in Donetsk in east Ukraine, their first claim of new gains since a Kyiv counter-offensive rattled Moscow's war effort.

The announcement came as Russia's Orthodox leader said President Vladimir Putin's rule has been mandated by God, congratulating him on his 70th birthday, and as the Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to rights defenders in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.

Separatist forces in the war-battered Donetsk region said they retook a series of villages near the Ukraine-controlled industrial town of Bakhmut, which has been under Russian shelling for weeks.

Journalists in the centre of Bakhmut heard the sound of heavy artillery and multiple rocket launch systems near the remains of a smashed bridge over the Bakhmutka river.

""On the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic, a grouping of troops of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, with fire support from Russian forces, liberated Otradovka, Veselaya Dolina and Zaitsevo,"" separatist forces said on social media.

The Donetsk region, which has been partially controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists for years, is a key prize for Russian forces, which invaded Ukraine in February.

But Ukraine's troops in recent weeks have been pushing back against Russian soldiers across the front lines in the south and in the east, including in parts of Donetsk.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Friday his forces recaptured nearly 2,500 sq km in the counter-offensive that began late last month.

""This week alone, our soldiers liberated 776 sq km of territory in the east of our country and 29 settlements, including six in the Lugansk region,"" he said.

He has pushed to punish Russia in other areas, urging Brussels to ramp up pressure on its energy sector, a day after the European Union imposed a fresh round of sanctions on Moscow.

The International Monetary Fund also announced Friday it would provide US$1.3 billion (S$1.9 billion) in emergency aid to Ukraine. The package will help meet Ukraine's ""urgent balance of payment needs… while playing a catalytic role for future financial support from Ukraine's creditors and donors"", the lender said in a statement."
1066643766,20221008,"Athens, Oct 8 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 8th Oct, 2022 ) :Cover-up allegations are dogging a short-lived Greek parliamentary investigation into a state wire-tapping scandal that wraps up next week without providing any real answers.

But the case, which has cast an unflattering light on the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, remains a priority for the European Parliament.

The European Union assembly is sending a fact-finding delegation in November to interview key witnesses.

The scandal could also impact the formation of a future Greek government, following a general election scheduled for 2023.

The affair broke in July when Nikos Androulakis -- a European Parliament lawmaker and leader of the Greek Socialist party (Pasok/Kinal) -- filed a legal complaint alleging there had been attempts to tap his mobile phone using illegal spyware known as Predator.

Within days, it emerged that Androulakis had indeed been under surveillance, separately, from the Greek intelligence service before he became leader of Pasok, Greece's third largest party.

In August, the Greek intelligence service chief, as well as a close aide and nephew to the prime minister, both resigned over the case.

This put the government in a tricky spot. For months it had fended off accusations of wire tapping made by two Greek journalists, one of whom claimed to have been hacked both by Predator and by state intelligence.

The Greek parliament responded by setting up a cross-party committee to investigate the scandal, which has drawn parallels to Watergate."
1066649122,20221008,"President Biden has officially signed an executive order that protects the data transfers between the US and the European Union. The executive order is meant for implementing the EU-US Data Privacy Framework or.

According to Engadget, addressing national security concerns which should be clearly defined, will require privacy and civil liberties to be taken into consideration when seeking data. On top of that, intelligence gatherers must update their policies for data handling.

Why is this Important?

The economic relationship between the European Union and the US is worth $7.1 trillion. Transatlantic data flows are important for enabling the said relationship. The Data Privacy Framework between the EU and US will restore a significant legal basis for data flows.

The executive order will address concerns raised by the Court of Justice of the European Union about striking down the prior EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as a ""valid data transfer mechanism"" under EU law, as mentioned in the official website of the White House.

Individuals in qualifying states will also be able to seek redress if they believe that their personal data is being taken through the US signals intelligence, if it violates applicable US law.

What Does the Executive Order Do?

Safeguards will be put into place so intelligence activities will only be conducted when necessary to advance a validated intelligence priority, limiting it in a manner proportionate to that priority.

Personal information collected through signals intelligence activities will now require handling requirements. For appropriate actions taken to remediate incidents of non-compliance, the mandate extends to the responsibilities of legal, oversight, and compliance officials.

To reflect the new privacy and civil liberties safeguards in the Executive Order, policies and procedures must be updated, keeping in mind that the updates will now require US Intelligence Community elements.

To ensure that concerned parties are consistent with the Executive Order and conduct an annual review of the redress process, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board will be called upon. They will review Intelligence Community policies and procedures. The Executive order will make sure the Intelligence Community fully complied to the determinations made by the CLPO and DPRC.

The mechanism is for individuals who claim that their personal information was collected or handled by the US in violation of applicable US law, granted that they are from qualifying states and regional economic integration organizations.

Firstly, the Civil Liberties Protection Officer in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (CLPO) will be conducting an initial investigation of complaints received to determine whether the Executive Order's safeguards were violated.

Second, The Executive Order will authorize and direct the Attorney General who will then establish a Data Protection Review Court or DPRC which will provide a binding review of the CLPO's decisions.

Judges from outside the US government will be appointed for the DPRC. They must have relevant experience in the matter of the field of data privacy and national security.

1066660772,20221008,"In the past few months, the European Union has imposed many sanctions on the Russian government due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. As per the reports, the EU announced another new sanction on Russia on 6th October, which states a total ban on cross-border crypto transfers between the EU and Russian wallets. Other phrases like crypto accounts, custody services, and many more are also included in the prohibition.

Due to the ongoing clash between Russia and Ukraine, the EU is putting more and more sanctions on Russia, along with force mobilization as well as nuclear escalation threats.

Previously, the European Union set a 10,000 dollar crypto transfer limit from Russian to European Union wallets. However, the EU’s main goal was to deny the Kremlin’s military further; therefore, they totally banned the cross-border crypto transfer between these two regions. It isn’t a good thing for the people living there.

The sanction was imposed soon after the Russian government allowed its citizens to use crypto for international transactions. The new law that authorized this transaction also includes guidance on how to get crypto assets and a list of their apps. The choice was also in line with the Russian Central Bank’s decision, which was made on 5th September last year.

As per the reports, Russia made a new deal with China based on which Russia intends to develop a new digital coin for transaction settlements. Currently, the development of the coin is in the pilot phase. By the end of 2020, the nation also passed a new law that allowed people to make payments using digital coins.

Despite this, when the EU sanctions were tightened because of the ongoing war, the US government imposed more barriers against Russia. Also, the EU announced another new sanction on Russia, which will make it difficult for them to make international transfers. Looking over these facts, we can clearly say that nothing is going as planned by Russia, and if the war continues, they will suffer from more sanctions which will not be a good thing.

1066686835,20221008,"By Natalia Drozdiak (Bloomberg) NATO allies are struggling to work out how to better safeguard undersea critical infrastructure after the Nord Stream pipelines blasts laid bare the difficulty of monitoring facilities and identifying any attackers.

The sheer scale and underwater depth of assets such as pipelines — or data cables that allow the internet to function — heighten the challenge for governments. With most systems owned by private companies, proving which government may have sponsored an attack is even more complex.

“We’ve had a theoretical concern that it could be vulnerable but until these Nord Stream explosions, we have not seen an incident like this on that infrastructure,” said Kristine Berzina, a senior fellow for security and defense policy at the German Marshall Fund in Washington, D.C. “Now this sets off lots of worries about what other kind of infrastructure can be targeted.”

Russia’s bellicose rhetoric and steps to throttle Europe’s energy supplies have sparked concern that Moscow might target crucial underwater infrastructure like the pipelines from Norway that supply more than a fifth of the continent’s natural gas, or some of the 400 undersea data cables that carry about 98% of international internet data and telephone traffic around the world.

The cause of the damage to the Nord Stream pipelines so far remains unknown. European Union leaders have widely condemned it as sabotage but only Poland has directly blamed Russia. President Vladimir Putin said last week the pipelines had been attacked by “Anglo-Saxons.”

Danish, Swedish and German officials are still investigating the causes, a process that can take weeks. Researchers have previously warned that Russia has both the military capabilities and knowledge of where undersea cables and infrastructure is located. Russian military ships have also often been sighted near cables or pipelines, for instance, when they’ve been laid down.

Allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have rushed to deploy military vessels and planes to monitor the Baltic and North Seas to prevent another such attack. Norway has stepped up patrols of its energy facilities after an abnormally high number of drones were sighted. The Italian Navy is reinforcing protection of strategic trans-Mediterranean pipelines.

Norway’s security service, however, lacks tools to prevent sabotage against the country’s energy facilities while such risks have increased, public broadcaster NRK cited the agency’s Deputy Chief Hedvig Moe as saying. While the service can prevent and investigate terrorist threats using so-called invasive methods, such as wiretapping and data mining, it can’t use such means to prevent sabotage, Moe was quoted as saying.

At a meeting of NATO defense ministers in 2020, the military alliance produced a report underscoring the vulnerabilities related to undersea cables and the importance of protecting undersea infrastructure.

“It is important to understand that most of these cables are privately owned and it’s publicly known where they are,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at the time. “And that makes them potentially vulnerable.”

Wojciech Lorenz, an analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs, said the Nord Stream pipeline damage displayed the typical hallmarks of hybrid warfare, combining plausible deniability and falling under the threshold of open conflict.

“Even if we don’t know who’s behind the attacks, Russia can use it for its own purposes,” Lorenz said, adding Moscow could exert pressure on some countries not to support sanctions as well as divert attention from Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territories.

The Nord Stream damage also comes as the Ukrainian military continues to drive Russian forces out of large parts of its country, which Berzina said could be yet another factor that points the blame toward Russia as Moscow may seek to distract from its failures.

NATO’s response to last month’s explosions is likely to be somewhat limited, since Swedish and Danish officials have noted the pipeline damage took place in their economic zones, not directly in their territorial waters

Alliance members could instead take other action including sanctions or more military aid for Ukraine in the event that Russia is behind the attack, according to a European diplomat.

NATO’s reaction might look different if Russia strikes a facility in territorial waters of one of the allies, which would potentially trigger the collective defense provisions in Article 5 of its treaty, according to Berzina.

“We should be concerned this could be a test run for a future situation that would meet those criteria,” she said.

1066693302,20221008,"General Sergey Surovikin had been appointed ""commander of the Joint Grouping of Forces in the areas of the special military operation"".

By India Today Web Desk: After suffering major setbacks that led to criticism of its army leadership, Russia on Saturday appointedGeneral Sergey Surovikinthe new general to lead Moscow's Ukraine offensive.According to reports, General Surovikin had been appointed ""commander of the Joint Grouping of Forces in the areas of the special military operation"", using the Kremlin's term for the offensive.

The development comes a day after Russia sacked the commander of its Eastern Military District, Colonel-General Alexander Chaiko. Chailo's sacking was reported as Russian forces continue to lose grounds in northeast Ukraine and Kyiv's recapture of the strategic hub of Lyman, in Donetsk region last month.

According to a Russian military website,Surovikin, 55, has combat experience in the 1990s conflicts in Tajikistan and Chechnya. He was also a part of Moscow's intervention in Syria in 2015. A defence ministry report earlier stated that Surovikin was leading the ""South"" forces in Ukraine.

The decision was announced after the Russian military faced massive criticism after it lost thousands of square kilometers in Ukraine's counteroffensive to recapture the northeastern Kharkiv region last month.

While Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov sought firing of top Russian military leadership, a senior lawmaker urged army personnel to stop 'lying' about the situation on the battlefield.

Even in September, the deputy defence minister in charge of logistics, General Dmitry Bulgakov, was replaced by Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev. As per reports, Bulgakov was accused by the European Union of orchestrating a siege of the Ukrainian port of Mariupol.

State-owned RIA news agency had also reported that the commander of the Black Sea fleet was sacked after a series of setbacks faced by Russian army, including sinking of its lead warship and loss of as many as eight warplanes."

CLAIM: A scientific study proved genetically modified corn isn’t safe to eat because it caused cancer in rats.



AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The 2012 study cited by some social media users was retracted by the academic journal that originally published it, after the publication determined the research was inconclusive and unreliable. Food safety agencies in the U.S. and European Union have found genetically modified foods are just as safe as their non-modified counterparts, and experts told The Associated Press there is no credible evidence that genetically engineered corn is unsafe.

THE FACTS: Social media users in recent days have falsely claimed genetically modified corn isn’t safe because it’s been found to cause cancerous tumors and other health complications in rats.

Most posts point to a decade-old study by Gilles-Eric Séralini, a molecular biologist at the University of Caen in Normandy, France, that generated fierce debate within the scientific community when it was first released in 2012, only to be retracted and republished elsewhere.

“Remember, GM corn proven unsafe for human consumption in chronic toxicity study from 2012,” wrote one Instagram user earlier this week. “How easily the world forgot, or never even knew about, the Seralini study on genetically modified corn that was conducted with the utmost stringent and accepted scientific standards, proving long-term damage to animals that consumed GM corn.”

The lengthy post, which has been liked a few hundred times, goes on to say that the test subjects, some of which were also given pesticides in their drinking water, died from “horrendous tumors in their cleansing organs” within months.

But the Séralini study was retracted by the academic journal Food and Chemical Toxicology the following year amid criticism from other scientists.

The peer-reviewed journal, in its 2013 retraction, said there was “legitimate cause for concern” because of the relatively low number of animals used in the study as well as the particular strain of rats tested.

The journal determined “no definitive conclusions” could be reached given the study’s small sample size of 200 rats broken out into groups of ten, some of which were fed genetically modified corn.

It also agreed with other scientists that the Sprague-Dawley rats used in the experiment were already prone to developing health problems at 18 months of age, including tumors.

The following year, however, another academic journal republished the study .

At the time, Environmental Sciences Europe said it decided to re-publish the paper to guarantee the scientific community access to the study’s data, though it acknowledged it did not conduct its own scientific peer review , as Food and Chemical Toxicology had concluded there had been no fraud or misrepresentation in the data itself.

Still, the republished work -- and publication of Seralini’s subsequent papers on the matter -- haven’t swayed national and international regulators.

In the U.S., the corn varieties addressed in Seralini’s study have all successfully completed the Food and Drug Administration’s review without raising food safety concerns, Kimberly DiFonzo, an agency spokesperson, said in an email Friday.

“We believe that the genetically engineered foods currently on the market are as safe as their non-genetically engineered counterparts,” she wrote.

The European Food Safety Administration, which provides recommendations to the European Union, has reached a similar conclusion that genetically modified corn is “safe on humans, animals and the environment,” said agency spokesperson Edward Bray.

Séralini’s study was “inadequately designed, analyzed and reported” and of “insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments,” he told The Associated Press on Friday in an email.

Subsequent studies by other scientists have also been unable to replicate Séralini’s data or conclusions, according to Richard Goodman, a food allergy researcher at the University of Nebraska who was an editor at Food and Chemical Toxicology when Séralini’s article was retracted by the journal. 



In fact, a 2019 study published in the Archives of Toxicology using a different strain of rat found “no adverse effects” from feeding the animals genetically modified corn, Goodman noted.

“To date, there is no credible evidence suggesting that human or animal consumption of currently-commercialized genetically engineered corns is unsafe,” Margaret Smith, an associate dean and corn breeding expert at Cornell University in New York, concurred in an email to the AP.

Séralini didn’t respond to emails seeking comment this week, but the French scientist has steadfastly maintained his work is valid.
