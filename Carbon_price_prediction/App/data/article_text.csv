1065666518,20221002,"More than seven months after Russia declared war on its neighbour Ukraine, Kremlin started the process of absorbing parts of the war-torn nation. In a not-so-surprising move, President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed treaties annexing occupied Ukrainian regions.

With the latest move, Putin has proclaimed Russian rule over 15 per cent of Ukraine, a claim that has received outright rejection from Western countries. This is not the first time Russia has occupied and claimed territories that did not belong to it. Previously, in 2014, Crimea met the same fate.

Meanwhile, in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's bid to join the military alliance, Nato said the membership decision requires 'consensus' of allies. Zelenskyy, who has remained firm in his stance to stop Ukraine from falling into Russian hands, had submitted an “accelerated” application to join the Nato military alliance.

But Zelenskyy knocking on Nato’s door for help has become an old tune now, with Russia hardly deterred by these moves.

Here are the top developments in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war:

On Friday, Vladimir Putin signed “accession treaties”, formalising the takeover of four regions in war-torn Ukraine- Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk. At the ceremony held in Moscow, Putin loudly proclaimed that they will “defend their land”.

""We will defend our land by all means. This is the liberation mission of the Russian people,"" Vladimir Putin said in what appears to be the latest thinly veiled reference to nuclear weapons.

Notably, when Kyiv had declared war on Moscow, Vladimir Putin said the military action announced by him will ""demilitarize"" Ukraine and was in response to threats from Ukraine.

Shortly after Vladimir Putin signed annexation treaties, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that his country is submitting an “accelerated” application to join the NATO military alliance.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said “we are taking our decisive step by signing Ukraine’s application for accelerated accession to Nato.”

The Ukrainian leader’s NATO application adds another layer of complexity to the seven-month old conflict that rapidly escalated following Putin’s announcement of annexing parts of Ukraine.

Zelenskyy also repeated his pledge to retake all Ukrainian territory now held by Russia which he said “feels our power.” He also said Ukraine is ready for dialogue with Moscow but “with another president of Russia.”

Nato membership for Ukraine was one of Russia's stated reasons for invading its pro-Western neighbor in February. Russia has repeatedly stated that it does not want Ukraine to join Nato, the transatlantic alliance created at the start of the Cold War to protect Europe from the Soviet Union.

A month into the war with Russia, Zelenskyy had shown willingness not to seek NATO membership in exchange for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine's security. However, several rounds of peace talks yielded no positive result.

Jens Stoltenberg, who is serving as the 13th secretary general of Nato, said,“Every democracy in Europe has the right to apply for Nato membership and we respect that right. We have repeated that Nato's door remains open and we have demonstrated that over the last years.""

Stoltenberg added, ""Nato allies when they met at the Nato summit in Madrid said so very clearly that we support Ukraine's right to choose its own path, to decide what kind of security arrangements they want to be part of.

The decision on membership has to be taken by all 30 allies and we take these decisions by consensus. Our focus now is providing immediate support to help Ukraine defend itself against the brutal Russian invasion.

On top of sanctions already levied against Russia following full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the US on Friday adopted even more sanctions after the Kremlin announced formal annexation of four Ukrainian regions.

The United States imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, targeting hundreds of people and companies, including those in Russia's military-industrial complex and lawmakers.

The European Union has condemned Russia’s land-grab. In a joint statement, the EU rejected and condemned “the illegal annexation” of the four regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

The EU’s 27 member states said they will never recognize the illegal referendums that Russia organized “as a pretext for this further violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

The UK has also imposed new services and goods export bans on Russia in response to what it termed the “illegal annexation” of four regions of Ukraine after “sham referendums”.

The services sanctions are designed to target vulnerable sectors of the Russian economy, including IT consultancy, architectural services, engineering services and transactional legal advisory services for certain commercial activities."
1065664448,20211002,"HELSINKI (AP) — Latvia held a general election Saturday amid divisions over Russia's attack on Ukraine among the Baltic country’s sizable ethnic-Russian minority. An exit poll predicted that the center-right will win the most votes but whoever forms the next government will face huge war-induced energy concerns.

A joint exit poll forecast that center-right New Unity party of Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins would win the election, capturing 22.5% of the vote. The poll was done by the Riga Stradins University, the SKDSA research center. the LETA newswire, Latvian Television and Latvian Radio.

The poll also predicted that a new centrist party that favors green development — United List — would be second with 11.5% of the vote and the opposition Greens and Farmers Union would come in third with 10.9% support. Only eight parties are predicted to pass the 5% barrier and secure representation at the 100-seat Saeima legislature.

Karins, a 57-year-old dual Latvian-U.S. citizen born in Wilmington, Delaware, told Latvian media that it would be easiest to continue with the same coalition government if New Unity wins. He has excluded any cooperation with pro-Kremlin parties.

Support for parties catering to Latvia's ethnic-Russian minority, who make up over 25% of Latvia's 1.9 million people, is expected to be mixed; some loyal voters have abandoned them since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

This election is likely to be the death knell for the opposition Harmony party, whose popularity has steadily declined. The Moscow-friendly party traditionally served as an umbrella for most of Latvia’s Russian-speaking voters, including Belarusians and Ukrainians. In the 2018 election, Harmony received almost 20% of the vote, the most of any single party, but was excluded by other parties from entering the government.

However, Harmony's immediate and staunch opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused many voters who still back Russian President Vladimir Putin to desert it. Those opposed to the war, meanwhile, tended to move toward Latvia’s mainstream parties, who condemned the invasion.

“I think the Russophonic part of the population is very fragmented,” Pauls Raudseps, a columnist at the Latvian news magazine IR, told The Associated Press. “You can’t say it’s unified on anything. Some part is pro-Putin. But what we’ve seen is that the war in general has changed attitudes. And it has happened fairly rapidly.”

“People are getting more active, and as you see, there is a queue already. So, hopefully some of the pro-Russians have switched to the more European parties now,” IT engineer Ratios Shovels, 38, said at a Riga district polling place.

Elena Dadukina, a 43-year-old lawyer said, said she wasn't sure if the healthy turnout was ""due to the war or whether people want greater responsibility in choosing their candidates because of how they will influence our domestic politics.”"

1065676901,20221002,"JENIN, Palestinian Territories — An Israeli raid in a West Bank flashpoint killed four Palestinians on Wednesday, including the brother of a man blamed for a deadly attack in Tel Aviv.

The attack was the latest to hit Jenin, in the north of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, an area that has seen near daily attacks by Israeli forces since an escalation which began in March.

Jenin deputy governor Kamal Abu Al Rub told AFP that Wednesday's raid was 'the most violent that the occupation army has carried out since the start of the year'.

The Palestinian health ministry recorded four dead and 44 wounded by live fire in the latest Israeli operation.

Among them was Abed Hazem, whose brother Raad was named as the killer of three Israelis in a shooting spree in Tel Aviv's busy nightlife district in April.

Raad Hazem was shot dead after a massive Israeli manhunt. Israeli occupation forces have been pursuing Abed and Raad's father Fathi for months.

At a mosque in Jenin refugee camp, hundreds of people prayed for the slain Abed Hazem, whose body was wrapped in a Palestinian flag, with young male mourners kissing his forehead.

The European Union, in a tweet, said it was 'alarmed by the spike in violence today in Jenin following the [Israeli] incursions'.

Since March, Israel has launched hundreds of operations in the northern West Bank in pursuit of alleged fighters, including in Jenin and nearby Nablus.

Analysts have warned that the dramatic increase in Israeli West Bank raids is further weakening the unpopular Palestinian Authority (PA), with Palestinians increasingly condemning President Mahmoud Abbas' administration for its security cooperation with Israel.

Following the latest Jenin unrest, Abbas' spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeina, accused Israel of“tampering with security and stability through pursuing a policy of escalation”, in a statement published by the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa.

Israel has demanded that the PA security forces do more to crack down on alleged fighters, and Prime Minister Yair Lapid vowed earlier this month that he would“not hesitate to act in any place that the Palestinian Authority does not maintain order”."

1065677611,20221002,"Burkina Faso's junta leader Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba on Saturday urged junior officers to ""come to their senses"" after they said they ousted him in a reported coup that sparked deep concern among foreign leaders.

The officers on Friday said they had toppled Damiba, accusing him of failure to quell jihadist attacks. It is the second coup this year in the West African country, and the latest in the Sahel region, much of which is battling a growing Islamist insurgency.

Making his first comments since the putsch, Damiba in a written statement urged his rivals ""to come to their senses to avoid a fratricidal war that Burkina Faso doesn't need.”

He rejected allegations by the army officers who seized power that he was hiding in a French base but provided no further details about his location.

Damiba himself came to power in a coup in January. He installed himself as leader of the country's 16 million people after accusing elected president Roch Marc Christian Kabore of failing to beat back jihadist fighters. But the insurgency has raged on.

Damiba ""is believed to have taken refuge in the French base at Kamboinsin in order to plan a counter-offensive to stir up trouble in our defense and security forces,"" the junior officers said Saturday in a statement read out on national television and signed by Captain Ibrahim Traore, the country's new leader.

In his comments on the presidency's official Facebook page, Damiba called that claim an attempt ""to manipulate opinion.”

France, the former colonial power in Burkina Faso, via its embassy earlier Saturday also denied ""any involvement of the French army in the events of the last few hours.”

It denied ""rumors that Burkinabe authorities have been hosted or are under the protection of the French military.”

The general staff of Burkina Faso's army dismissed the coup as an ""internal crisis"" within the military, and said dialogue was ""ongoing"" to remedy the situation.

Among a wave of international criticism, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""strongly condemns any attempt to seize power by the force of arms and calls on all actors to refrain from violence and seek dialogue,"" his spokesperson said.

""Burkina Faso needs peace, stability and unity to fight terrorist groups and criminal networks operating in parts of the country,"" the U.N. statement added.

Jihadist violence has also prompted a series of coups in Mali, Guinea and Chad since 2020.

The new Burkina Faso putschists said they were willing ""to go to other partners ready to help in the fight against terrorism.""

No country was explicitly mentioned but Russia, whose influence is growing in French-speaking Africa, is among the possible partners in question.

France has a contingent of military special forces based in Kamboinsin which is about 30 kilometers from the capital, Ouagadougou.

A few hours before the coup Friday, hundreds of people had rallied in the capital seeking the departure of Damiba, the end of France's military presence in the Sahel and military cooperation with Russia.

The situation in the capital was tense on Saturday, with gunfire and soldiers deployed in the streets.

Helicopters hovered above the city and shops shut their doors.

Late Saturday, a French government spokesperson strongly condemned ""violence"" against its embassy after an AFP reporter said he saw a fire outside the building in Ouagadougou.

Witnesses said there was also a fire in front of the French Institute in the western city of Bobo-Dioulasso.

African Union chief Moussa Faki Mahamat condemned the ""unconstitutional change of government"" in Burkina Faso.

The European Union warned the latest coup put in danger efforts towards restoring constitutional order by July 2024, while the U.S. government said it was ""deeply concerned.”

Just before 8 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Friday, more than a dozen soldiers in fatigues appeared on the state television and radio broadcaster to announce Damiba's removal.

They proclaimed 34-year-old Captain Traore in charge. He was previously head of the anti-jihadist special forces unit ""Cobra"" in the northern region of Kaya.

""Since he came to power, the zones that were peaceful were attacked. He took power but then he betrayed us.""

The new leaders suspended the constitution, sealed the borders, dissolved the transitional government and legislative assembly, and instituted a 9 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew.

More than 40% of Burkina Faso remains outside government control.

In the north and east, towns have been blockaded by insurgents who have blown up bridges and attacked supply convoys.

Thousands have died and about 2 million have been displaced by the fighting since 2015, when the insurgency spread to Burkina Faso from Mali."

Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Denis Moncada verbally notified Muscheidt that she should leave the country after the EU delegation demanded freedom for “political prisoners” at the United Nations General Assembly last week.

Ortega’s government also announced on Friday that it was suspending diplomatic ties with the Netherlands.

“Other countries have also noticed difficulties in maintaining an open dialogue with Nicaragua. We will discuss our next steps with the EU,” he added.

As Nigeria turned 62 years yesterday, former President Goodluck Jonathan and some governors have urged Nigerians to prioritise patriotism, unity and peace above other pecuniary considerations as they make their choices at the polls in 2023.



Also, Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, Ben Ayade of Cross River State, Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State; and Rivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, also preached peace and unity yesterday.



Likewise, the Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has also challenged Nigerians to forge a common front to salvage the country from the political and economic stranglehold of the All Progressives Congress (APC).



In the same mood, the European Union and the British High Commission in Nigeria have reiterated their commitments to support Nigeria’s democracy.

The leaders, in their separate goodwill messages to mark Nigeria’s 62nd Independence anniversary, observed that the anniversary came at a time the nation was preparing for its 2023 elections.



In a message he signed, Jonathan urged Nigerians “to prioritise the unity and peace of our country in our campaigns, and through the choices, we would make at the polls in 2023.”



 He added that the anniversary “is a critical moment for us all. The elections provide another opportunity for our citizens to demonstrate our faith in the greatness of our nation. Let us be patriotic in the choices we make.



“Ours is a great nation with boundless possibilities. Let us work in unity, live in peace, promote justice, and accommodate each other. That way, we shall build an inclusive and cohesive society where everyone is happy, safe, and proud of his country,” the former president said.



The former president, therefore, noted that the anniversary offered Nigerians a chance to reflect on the experience of nationhood and the prospect of progress and greatness, adding that the people had been steadfast in patriotism in challenging times.



At a parade commemorating the country’s 62nd Independence anniversary at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena, Onikan, Lagos, Sanwo-Olu challenged the electorate to focus on issue-based campaigns and refrain from the politics of division and bitterness.

 He urged Nigerians to respect divergent opinions as the beauty of democracy lies in the fact that everyone would not share the same ideological and political views.



 The Lagos State governor also urged the citizens “to focus on issues and refrain from the politics of division and bitterness.”

On his part, Akeredolu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, congratulated Nigerians on the occasion of Nigeria’s 62nd Independence anniversary,



He observed that the country “urgently needs power devolution that will support the regions, lessen unrest, and address the nation’s problems holistically.”

 Akeredolu called for coordinated efforts to solve the multitude of issues the country is currently facing while urging the people to maintain their faith in the nation and embrace peace.



 Also, in his commemoration address, Wike lamented the alleged inability of the APC-led federal government, over the last seven years, to keep the economic and social conditions within Nigeria from deteriorating.



He added that the inability of the ruling APC “to tackle the dwindling economy of the country is evidence that if given the further opportunity, the predicaments facing Nigerians will get worse.



“Life is sacrosanct, but the present federal government has failed in the most basic duty to the nation to protect the lives and property of its citizens. Under their watch, infrastructure across all sectors, including roads, education and healthcare has collapsed.”

While speaking at the Lafia Public Square, Sule appealed to the residents of the Nasarawa State “to adhere strictly to the provision of the electoral act of the ongoing electioneering activities of the country.



“Let me use the opportunity of this occasion to state that the ban on the 2023 Presidential electioneering campaign has been lifted a few days ago by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and in no distant time, the governorship and other elective offices will follow suit.”



He, therefore, urged the political parties “to adhere strictly to democratic ethos, rule of law and adherence to the provision of the Electoral Act. I enjoin you to play politics without bitterness because, at the end of it all, we will have one Nasarawa State which we call our own.”



Ayade, in his speech at the U.J. Esuene Stadium, Calabar, said despite the challenges associated with the lean resources of the state, his administration has made giant strides in the area of industrialisation.



Ayade, represented by his deputy, Prof. Ivara Esu, said the anniversary offers Nigerians “an opportunity to reflect on our history and deeply appreciate the progress we have made so far despite the many hiccups we have had and the very troubling scope of our present political, social and economic realities as a country.”



Meanwhile, the European Union and the British High Commission in Nigeria have reiterated their commitments to support Nigeria’s democracy.

The envoys committed to Nigeria’s 62 Independence anniversary celebration in Abuja.



The Ambassador of the European Union to Nigeria and the ECOWAS, Ms. Samuela Isopi, said Nigeria is a work in progress just like any country in the world.

“No country is where they want to be; it is always a work in progress for every country and I think Nigeria has made huge progress, especially if you think about democracy.



“Think about all the progress that has been made since the return to civilian rule, so I think that Nigeria is a country with huge potential.

“We hope that you will continue to develop that potential in the future and the European Union as a partner will continue to support Nigeria especially Nigerian youths in helping them to realise their potential.’’



British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catrina Laing, said Nigeria at 62 years after independence calls for reflection on the bond between the UK and Nigeria.

“It is a wonderful event and 62 years for Nigeria post-independence particularly poignant year because obviously, we have had the recent death of Her Majesty the Queen.



“We have all reflected on the very strong bonds between the UK and Nigeria which go back to pre-independence.

“The Queen visited in 1957 before independence so looking ahead, we have the elections coming up and the world’s eyes will be on Nigeria.

“The democratic journey of Nigeria continues and we congratulate Nigeria on that and we look forward to a more prosperous more secure future.



“There are always things we would like to see Nigeria do better, but there has been progress and I think one really important progress is a democracy since 1999, stuck with it in a very unstable region.

“Nobody questions the president stepping down, everyone sees that Nigeria’s elections have continued to improve, there’s always room for improvement, but I think the Democratic journey is one great achievement for Nigeria.’’"
1065685632,20221002,"The Israeli Mission to the European Union submitted on Friday a request to cut funding for 60 organizations and movements active in the countries of the Union and which support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel.

“These organizations receive large funding from the EU to support human rights and combat racism, but their activities focus on supporting boycotts and incitement against Israel and the Jewish people, and on pursuing anti-Semitic plans,” the Mission said in its statement.

It added that these actions violate EU laws and contradict the interests of cooperation and partnership among the peoples of the world.

The European Union announced on Thursday that it had invited Tel Aviv to the first Association Council meeting on Monday.

The last Association Council meeting was held in 2012 and further gatherings were paused after Israeli authorities objected to the EU’s position regarding West Bank settlements.

Diplomatic sources in Tel Aviv and Brussels said the Europeans are keen on opening a new chapter in relations with Israel, after 12 years of strained relations under former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Last month, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell warmly welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid’s support for a peace agreement based on two states for two peoples, as underlined in his speech at the UN General Assembly.

The EU said the discussion at the Association Council meeting will focus on issues such as trade, climate change, energy, science and technology, culture, the respect for human rights and democratic principles, freedom of religion as well as the fight against anti-Semitism.

The EU statement noted that the Israeli delegation will be represented by Lapid, in addition to Borrell who will head up the European side during the gathering.

As soon as the EU announced its plan to hold the Association Council meeting, the aforementioned 60 organizations issued a statement criticizing Israel’s return to the partnership with the EU despite not changing its settlement policy.

They sent a letter to the EU presidency and its 27-member countries demanding that the meeting be cancelled. They also called for suspending the ongoing talks between the EU and Tel Aviv to supply Europe with gas extracted from Israeli wells in the Mediterranean."
1065689543,20221002,"The oil producers of the OPEC+ convene on Wednesday to set output targets for November. With Brent crude trading at $85 a barrel, the group is expected to agree to a second straight production cut. But even a big reduction to targets may have little impact on actual supplies, unless they can agree to redistribute production targets, or the Saudis step in to act alone.

Meeting virtually in early September, members agreed to a token cut of 100,000 barrels a day to output targets for October. This time around the curtailment is likely to be much larger, with some analysts estimating that it could be as much as 1 million barrels a day, although a figure of half that size is the most widely forecast number. The group has also taken a last-minute decision to meet face to face for the first time since March 2020. That may indicate that it will try to do something more significant than apply a pro-rata cut to existing targets. It certainly needs to.

OPEC+ can’t keep things as they are and retain credibility. The amount the group pumps and its theoretical target have become increasingly estranged from each other over the course of the year, with output lagging behind the planned volume by more than 3.5 million barrels a day in August, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg.

That big gap is going to dilute the effects of any cut decided on Wednesday, unless they can agree to redistribute targets among themselves to reflect the inability of most members to pump as much as they’re allowed.

Even a reduction of 1 million barrels a day, shared pro rata among the members, would require just six countries to make actual cuts. All the rest are pumping so far below their individual targets that a step-down would have no impact. The resulting reduction would be just 337,000 barrels a day — and that’s assuming, perhaps optimistically, that all six stick to the plan.

Any reduction will come a month before European Union sanctions on Russian crude exports come into effect on Dec. 5, complicating the outlook. Russia is a powerful and valued member of OPEC+, so despite the group’s self-declared role of balancing oil supply and demand, don’t expect other members to rally round and make up for any shortfall in global availability resulting from the EU embargo.

Seaborne crude shipments to Europe from Russia are currently running at about 820,000 barrels a day, but the sanctions could hit wider flows, with the EU also set to ban the provision of insurance and other services to tankers carrying Russian crude, no matter where they’re headed.

Defining acceptable baselines for output cuts back in April 2020, when the current arrangement was agreed, was difficult enough. And at that time crude was trading below $35 a barrel and still heading south, a guarantee of focused minds. With Brent at $85, many producers won’t feel the same existential threat that they did when the Covid pandemic struck. And giving up market share, even if it’s only theoretical market share, is never popular.

But it’s not impossible. The OPEC+ group has shown remarkable cohesion over the past two and a half years. And I wouldn’t underestimate the ability of Saudi Arabia to cajole, or bully, the rest of the group to see things as it does.

And if it fails, the kingdom can always make another of its voluntary additional cutbacks. With production now running at about 11 million barrels a day, the kingdom could certainly afford to trim output, and some of its oil infrastructure might benefit from a rest.

Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman clearly enjoys springing surprises, especially when they’re designed to discomfit traders shorting oil. The fact that ministers have agreed to meet face to face suggests something more meaningful than a pro-rata cut in output targets is on the table."

At a meeting with Jatiya Party chairman GM Quader, diplomats from some European countries in Dhaka on Sunday said that the next general elections in Bangladesh should be held in a free, fair, and credible manner with the participation of all political parties.

The European Union ambassador to Bangladesh, Charles Whiteley, invited GM Quader to a breakfast meeting at his Gulshan residence, where JP secretary general Mujibul Haque Chunnu and ambassadors from as many as nine European countries were also present.

‘European Union heads of mission are continuing their regular meetings with political parties to gain insights into the outlook in Bangladesh. Today, together with HOMs of Sweden and Denmark, we met GM Quader, Chairman of the Jatiya Party, for a wide-ranging exchange,’ Whiteley tweeted.

Speaking to New Age later in the day, Mujibul said that they discussed the latest political situation in the country with the diplomats.

He said that European diplomats want the next general elections in Bangladesh to be participatory and held in a free, fair, and credible manner.

‘The diplomats wanted to know our opinion regarding the caretaker system of government to supervise the elections. We said that we do not believe in the caretaker government system,’ said the JP secretary general, also a former state minister in the Awami League-led government in its previous term.

He said that they told the diplomats that free, fair, and credible elections could be conducted by the present Election Commission under the partisan government if they were given sufficient power.

The diplomats also wanted to know their opinion on the use of electronic voting machines in the elections.

‘We have told them that using the EVMs is not a problem in the elections. The people who would operate the machines might be the problem,’ Mujibul said, adding that the government employees responsible for operating the EVMs could be a problem as they would try to favour the ruling government.

According to a JP press release, diplomats from Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and France attended the meeting."
1065701816,20221002,"BEIRUT—A European Union-funded programme is helping Syrian refugees and Lebanese youth affected by the country’s economic crisis finish their educations.

Syrian refugees who fled their war-ravaged country to uncertain futures in neighbouring states had to deal with devastating consequences, including the abrupt interruption of their university studies. But a few fortunate students were able to access higher education under the HOPES (Higher and Further Education Opportunities and Perspectives for Syrians) programme.

The European Union put 12 million Euros into the five-year HOPES programme through its regional trust fund known as the Madad Fund.

Madad started HOPES in 2014 in response to the Syrian refugee crisis. It sought to provide access to quality higher-education opportunities for Syrian refugees as well as vulnerable youth in the host communities of Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Turkey.

The initial HOPES programme ended in 2020, but its successor, HOPES-Leb, is continuing until 2023 in Lebanon.

Shahd Khalaf was two years into undergraduate studies in her home city of Homs, Syria, when she had to flee to Lebanon. Unlike Awwad, she initially struggled to get accepted in the Lebanese University.

“First I had to gain recognition of my qualifications and previous studies,” she said. “I faced great difficulties to follow the system and I actually failed all my courses in the first semester.”

She caught up, eventually, however. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Arabic literature, which her parents had to pay for, Khalaf said she was lucky to win a HOPES scholarship to do a master’s degree.

“If it wasn’t for the HOPES scholarship, I would not have been able to continue my higher education,” she said. “I am so grateful that they stood up for us at a time we were in desperate need of support and assistance.”

As well as awarding 1,026 full scholarships regionally, the programme offered psychosocial and academic counselling to more than 26,000 students . Some 8,500 students received university-based courses on English-language and study skills to help them adapt to the academic systems of host countries, and 283 English teachers were trained.

David Knox, director of the British Council in Lebanon, told Al-Fanar Media how the HOPES programme was designed to help Syrian refugees integrate into the education system of their host countries.

“There was recognition that young Syrians moving into neighbouring countries were not able to access higher education. As part of the European response, the British Council’s role was to support English-language teaching, because the lack of a foreign language was one of the barriers Syrians were facing in accessing higher education opportunities in neighbouring countries.”

“The British Council also upskilled (local) English teachers by offering an intensive English teaching training programme for academic purposes.”

In addition to the British Council, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), Campus France, and Nuffic, the Dutch organisation for internationalisation in education, also helped run HOPES in partnership with 19 universities across the region.

“Prior to the [Syrian] crisis there was not much movement for academic purposes between Syria and Lebanon,” said Knox, of the British Council. “Admission offices in Lebanese universities were not used to assessing Syrian qualifications. The Issam Fares Institute built a tool to help them recognise equivalents of these qualifications.”

Like the original HOPES programme, HOPES-Leb is also funded by the Madad Fund and implemented by DAAD, Campus France and Nuffic.

Carsten Walbiner, project director of HOPES-Leb representing DAAD, underlined the programme’s new localised approach.

“Lessons learned, we have a stronger emphasis on the host community,” Walbiner said. “In terms of activities, it is more like we did before. We have 18 Lebanese institutions that receive project funding to cater for the needs of students across Lebanon. We provide short non-degree courses to prepare for university and the labour market in addition to vocational training.”

The programme now caters almost equally to refugees and Lebanese, many of whom can no longer afford to continue their university education because of Lebanon’s ongoing economic crisis.

The Lebanese University, the country’s sole public higher education establishment, took most of HOPES scholarship students. The private Lebanese International University (LIU) has been enlisted under the HOPES-Leb programme to cater for Syrians only.

Walbiner explained: “LIU has branches all over Lebanon and it is an affordable and flexible private university. Syrians don’t qualify for certain programmes at the Lebanese University and cannot register without a proper residency permit, while they can at LIU, though they cannot graduate before acquiring their residency permit.”

While refugees from Syria share common challenges with other students studying abroad, such as language and cultural barriers, they face additional disadvantages. As displaced people, many are traumatised, have to work to make an income, and often encounter hostility and discrimination.

Amer Absi, a 26-year-old who was awarded a scholarship for a master’s degree in Arabic language and literature, explained: “I have known all the difficulties every Syrian young man would face, especially financial problems. I will never find the right words to describe how HOPES supported me and helped me to continue my academic journey.”

Awwad, who wants to be a teacher in Lebanon or abroad, also expressed gratitude. “The HOPES programme definitely gave me and other Syrian refugees hope,” he said.

1065705306,20221002,"Amnesty International Wednesday said Lesotho must address police brutality, extrajudicial killings and torture ahead of the nation’s October 7 elections. The organization has collected evidence of many instances of torture at the hands of law enforcement and hopes candidates will make human rights a priority before and after the upcoming vote.

This January, the Lesotho Mounted Police Service arrested human rights lawyer Napo Mafaesa on suspicions that he concealed a gun belonging to a client and tortured him for hours to extract a confession. In May, police officers and personnel from the Lesotho Defense Forces beat and tortured 19 men and 16 women after they protested power cuts in Liseleng. A single law firm in Maseru is currently handling 58 cases of police brutality dating as far back as 2018.

A 2021 United Nations report outlined key goals for Lesotho to reach by 2023, including that government entities would “uphold good Governance, rule of law and human rights” and all people would have “improved access to justice and participating in social and political decision making processes in a peaceful environment.”

According to Amnesty International, however, authorities have not reached this goal. Amnesty’s Director for East and Southern Africa Muleya Mwananyanda described the climate, saying:

It is the duty of the police to protect the public, yet Lesotho’s track record of police brutality shows that the public have much to fear from their law enforcement officers. It is time for the Lesotho authorities to take a zero-tolerance attitude to unlawful killings, torture and other ill-treatment by their security forces and ensure that those suspected to be responsible are held to account. Victims must be provided with access to justice and effective remedies.

A Commonwealth team lead by the former President of Seychelles Danny Faure will travel to Lesotho to observe the October elections and report any issues of credibility to the Commonwealth and the government of Lesotho.

• PIA allows 6 flight slots of London Heathrow Airport to Turkish Airlines and 1 slot to Kuwait Airways.
• PIA Management has given them under the babysitting concept for 6 months.

LONDON: Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has given seven of its landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport — one of the world's most important and busiest airports — to two foreign airlines.

According to the details available with Geo.tv, PIA allowed six flight slots at the London Heathrow Airport to Turkish Airlines, while it gave one slot to Kuwait Airways for a period of six months.

After the ban on PIA flights by the European Union, PIA has entered into an agreement with foreign airlines for landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport.

PIA's CEO and Chief Commercial Officer are in Istanbul to finalise the deal and PIA's slots will be secured once the deal is signed.

According to sources, London Heathrow Airport had asked PIA to cancel its expensive landing slots as they were not being used due to the ban.

In order to secure its slots, the PIA management had started discussions with other airlines— the national carrier wanted to temporarily transfer its minimum mandatory 7 slots to other airlines.

Cancellation of flight slots would have affected PIA's future operations at London's Heathrow Airport and forced PIA to move to second-tier airports Gatwick or Luton.

According to the PIA spokesperson, Heathrow Airport slots are of great importance to PIA and it was crucial to make them operational through babysitting. ""We have given them under the babysitting concept for six months and will get them back once the flight operation starts”.

He further said that Aviation Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique is personally monitoring the matter.

The European Union and the British authorities had banned all Pakistani airlines, including PIA, on the pilot license issue. The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority has not been able to satisfy the European and British authorities despite the passage of two and a half years."

1065734981,20221002,"Economic need is the most significant of the risk factors of trafficking in persons in Bangladesh, says the First National Study on Trafficking in Persons in Bangladesh.

The study's finding also highlighted climate change as another emerging root cause it said, adding that traffickers targeting victims affected by environmental disasters such as floods and droughts which erode livelihoods and heighten levels of vulnerability.

The report launched on Sunday at a city hotel by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Government of Bangladesh was based on a collection of data and evidence carried out between mid-2020 and mid-2021 via desk review of existing data and information, and field research.

It said traffickers use deceptive schemes in the recruitment stage so that job offers appear as viable solutions to alleviate conditions of economic need.

While Bangladesh substantially reduced its poverty rates by nearly 30% between the early 1990s and the late 2010s, many people living in rural areas remain in poverty, with limited economic opportunities.

Though poor districts are located all over the country, there is a concentration of these in the Western Division of Rangpur (Kurigram, Dinajpur, Gaibandha, Rangpur, and Lalmonirhat). Other districts among the poorest in the country are Bandaraban (Division of Chattogram), Magura (Khulna), Kishoganj (Dhaka), Khagrachari (Chattogram) and Jamalpur (Mymensingh), according to the report. 

 Research on trafficking tactics suggests that traffickers mislead victims by resorting to deception. They can easily mislead the poor population due to lack of knowledge or information about regular migration.

Besides, people living in poverty are more vulnerable to victimisation by traffickers promising better opportunities for income generation within Bangladesh and the region, in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and North America and Europe.

Apart from identifying the causes and risk levels of human trafficking in Bangladesh, some recommendations were also made, including include building strong deterrence mechanisms to combat crime, ensuring legal protection for victims and developing strategies to end human trafficking and forced labour through legal channels.

According to UNODC's 2020 Global Report on Human Trafficking, 51% of people in Bangladesh fall prey to traffickers.

The study used this report of UNODC as a data reference.

As the chief guest at the event, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said solutions would be made keeping the findings of the study in mind.

The study was under the framework of the European Union funded Global Action against Trafficking in Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants project (GLO.ACT-Bangladesh) and in cooperation with the Research and Trend Analysis Branch of the UNODC.

Among others, expat minister Imran Ahmed, Ambassador and Head of the Delegation, European Union, spoke at the event."
1065741689,20221002,"Sustainability is a major point when discussing palm oil. As the most consumed vegetable oil in the world, palm oil’s consistent high-yield production attracts scrutiny from market competitors and observers alike for potential irregularities that may provide an unfair advantage. While unsurprising and rational, it has become an opportunity for discriminatory treatments against palm oil producers, putting their production practices into question.

The European Union (EU) has imposed regulations on palm oil, specifically banning its use in biofuel productions. The United States (US) too – via the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – have banned palm oil imports from selected companies, such as the Withhold Release Order (WRO) against Sime Darby Plantations. These are some of the more heavy-handed treatments received by the global palm oil industry. Other treatments include restrictive regulations and policies on palm oil imports by the EU , along with mandating a labelling requirement on the contents for all their vegetable oil products. The latter requirement is also shared by Australia, who has also encouraged the use of certified sustainable palm oil to promote the protection of wildlife habitat.

Aside from these legislative actions, there are also ongoing anti-palm oil campaigns. Previously, US soybean lobbyists linked claims of high cholesterol levels to the saturated fats found in palm oil. European green NGOs are openly receiving EU funding to actively campaign on rapeseed and sunflower oil in developing countries while at the same time trying to improve their environmental practices.

On one hand, we can take these campaigns and legislative actions from these established markets from a holistic standpoint and address the arguments they present. Labour was the justification behind the US bans - the 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report (Malaysia) published by the US State Department a key document in these actions. The EU, on the other hand, argued on grounds of deforestation - oil palm is a major crop for all countries producing it, with most palm oil yield contributed by commercial plantations that make up a large percentage of agricultural land use in these countries.

The European market is one that is a very critical market on plantation forests, as it implies the deforestation of natural, virgin forests to make way for large scale oil palm plantations. Europe has been very vocal about deforestation since the 1980s, evidenced by its support on the various campaigns against the timber industry during that time. This stance has continued to this day, leaving a lasting impact on the global timber industry in the form of the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan established in 2003. This firm stand is necessary in the light of climate change. However, it needs reiterating that while oil palm plantations are plantation forests, plantation forests aren’t necessarily oil palm plantations, and EU’s firm stand has contributed to a tendency to overlook this overlap between oil palm plantations and plantation forests, resulting in heavy handed – and sometimes outdated – treatments and policies in broad strokes.

On the other hand, these legislative actions seem heavy-handed. Along with the active campaigns, such as those from the US soybean lobbyists and green European NGOs, it feels like the larger markets are asserting their presence, exerting market and political pressure via legislations and global campaigns.

As a major crop in Malaysia, oil palm forms 68% of agricultural land use (5.9 million ha) in 2020 as per the Department of Statistics Malaysia, with majority of these lands (72%) under plantation estates. But the size of land use is not the main reason why palm oil is the most consumed vegetable oil in the world. Oil palm is a perennial crop, with trees producing economically viable volumes of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) over a lifespan of 30 years. A mature oil palm tree produces bunches of fruits weighing around 20kg about 15 times a year.

These high-yield characteristics already guarantee a profitable return, but what sets palm oil apart from other vegetable oil such as soybean, rapeseed, and sunflower seed (the next three most consumed vegetable oil in the world) is its superior economic competitiveness. The yield of palm oil is 3.49 tonne/hectare, 5-8 times more productive as compared to other vegetable oil crops. For reference, rapeseed oil yield is at 0.78 tonne/hectare, while soybean oil yield is at 0.46 tonne/ hectare. This comparison brings to light many things, but most importantly it asserts that rapeseed and soybean will require a much larger and extensive land use just to produce the same yield as palm oil.

This economy of scale provides meaningful context to the sentiments behind legislations and campaigns by the EU, the US, and Australia.

The truth about palm oil sustainability is somewhere between the arguments behind the actions of the Western markets above and the actual actions taken. But focusing on this alone will not resolve nor address any sustainability concerns of palm oil production; it is not a zero-sum game because it is larger than just winning an argument against established markets such as the ones above. The way forward would be to strike a balance between the questions posed by these markets and maintaining palm oil’s environmental and economic contributions.

The Malaysian Palm Oil Industry is a 102-billion-ringgit industry that is home to more than 450,000 small farmers. Malaysia is the research and development hub for the global palm oil industry. We have made huge progress in yield improvements via genome mapping, clonal work, and mechanisation. We have also made use of palm oil biomass to generate biofuels and oleochemicals, both of which are profitable by-products that have added to the palm oil value chain. All these are definitely a great place to start the conversation about sustainable palm oil.

For Malaysia at least, the conversation had taken off within the industry around 2015, with the development of the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) scheme. Like many certification schemes that begin as a voluntary scheme, the MSPO was one of the efforts by the Malaysian palm oil industry players to keep themselves onside in the global market. Developed by the Malaysian Palm Oil Industry together with the Malaysian Palm Oil Certification Council (MPOCC), MSPO is a set of standards to ensure sustainable palm oil production in Malaysia. It consists of the Oil Palm Management Certification (OPMC) and the Supply Chain Certification Standards (SCCS), both of which are effective and practical approaches in helping the industry arrive at a green and ethical – sustainable - palm oil industry.

At the time of writing, MSPO implementation in the Malaysian Palm Oil Industry has reached 96% . The MSPO Trace that was launched in November 2019 has undergone further improvements after user and stakeholder feedback, with its compliance being made mandatory for maintaining certification status since 1 September 2020. The remaining percentages mainly involve independent smallholders, where issues such as legal land title and document safekeeping are major certification obstacles . Despite this positive progress, Greenpeace and the EU are critical of MSPO, as the “Destruction: Certified” report asserted that certification is a weak tool against global deforestation and ecosystem destruction.

The same report also highlighted the need for greater government-togovernment cooperation in addressing global deforestation, beyond just the EU. In this sense, the MSPO can be a game-changer - it is reviewed regularly by panels that openly invite the world at large to provide input into its everevolving standards. It is a national level certification with legislative support and is an initiative that has begun to highlight the shortcomings of voluntary certification schemes such as the RSPO. This is a precedent that should bridge the global palm oil industry and markets together, and remains as evidence that Malaysia is owning its position as a major global palm oil producer by taking the lead in developing a set of standards that can help shape a more sustainable palm oil industry around the world."

Although this party has not yet gone into extinct due to unimaginable favor extended by the ruling party, several leaders of this party are maintaining discreet connections with a number of anti-Bangladesh elements such as Zulkarnain Saer Khan Sami, Tasneem Khalil, Shahid Uddin Khan, Lt Col Mustafizur Rahman, Hasinur Rahman, Kanak Sawrwar, Abdur Rab Bhuttaw and others. Another source said, Jatiyo Party leaders are maintaining communications with Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) with the hope of forming electoral alliance only if BNP would agree to leave at least 100 seats to it during the election.

Meanwhile, Jatiya Party (JP) Chairman GM Quader held a meeting with European Union (EU) Ambassador Charles Whiteley and other ambassadors of the member states of the EU. Ambassadors of Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, France were present in the meeting. Secretary General of JP Mujibul Huq Chunnu and Special Envoy to the Chairman Masrur Mawla attended the meeting.

According to sources, the upcoming national elections were discussed mainly in the meeting. The ambassadors wanted to know the position of the Jatiya Party in during upcoming elections.

In response, the Jatiya Party chairman GM Quader outlined his party’s position.

Ambassadors wanted to know whether JP would participate in the election under the current government. They also wanted to know JP’s opinion about opposition’s demand of holding the next general elections under caretaker government.

GM Quader told the ambassadors that his party (Jatiya Party) feels that the current government has become an authoritarian regime. If an election is held under them, it will become a one-sided election. He said caretaker government system is also not entirely correct.

Jatiya Party has not taken any final decision on what system of elections will be acceptable to all. In the next few days, it will be finalized after discussing with the leaders and workers of all levels of the party.

Quader said, he cannot take unilateral decision regarding boycotting the next general election if that is held under the current government. For this he needs to discuss with party leaders.

According to sources, the ambassadors also wanted to know about some party matters of the Jatiya Party – the party’s explanation has been presented in this regard.

It may be mentioned here that, Jatiyo Party believes in transforming Bangladesh into an Islamic republic while its founder, military dictator Hussain Muhammed Ershad gave Islam the status of state religion. During the past 14 years, several Jatiyo Party leaders, including many of the Presidium members have amassed unimaginable wealth while some of them had smuggled-out millions of dollars overseas including the United States, Canada, Britain and Australia.

According to sources, several front-ranking leaders of Jatiya Party are actively involved in spreading rumor against the ruling party, while few of them are tactfully misleading people by participating in TV talk shows."

At a meeting with Jatiya Party chairman GM Quader, diplomats from some European countries in Dhaka on Sunday said that the next general elections in Bangladesh should be held in a free, fair, and credible manner with the participation of all political parties.

The European Union ambassador to Bangladesh, Charles Whiteley, invited GM Quader to a breakfast meeting at his Gulshan residence, where JP secretary general Mujibul Haque Chunnu and ambassadors from as many as nine European countries were also present.

‘European Union heads of mission are continuing their regular meetings with political parties to gain insights into the outlook in Bangladesh. Today, together with HOMs of Sweden and Denmark, we met GM Quader, Chairman of the Jatiya Party, for a wide-ranging exchange,’ Whiteley tweeted.

Speaking to New Age later in the day, Mujibul said that they discussed the latest political situation in the country with the diplomats.

He said that European diplomats want the next general elections in Bangladesh to be participatory and held in a free, fair, and credible manner.

‘The diplomats wanted to know our opinion regarding the caretaker system of government to supervise the elections. We said that we do not believe in the caretaker government system,’ said the JP secretary general, also a former state minister in the Awami League-led government in its previous term.

He said that they told the diplomats that free, fair, and credible elections could be conducted by the present Election Commission under the partisan government if they were given sufficient power.

The diplomats also wanted to know their opinion on the use of electronic voting machines in the elections.

‘We have told them that using the EVMs is not a problem in the elections. The people who would operate the machines might be the problem,’ Mujibul said, adding that the government employees responsible for operating the EVMs could be a problem as they would try to favour the ruling government.

Russia's Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines burst this week, draining gas into the Baltic Sea off the coast of Denmark and Sweden. Seismologists registered explosions in the area.

The European Union said it suspected sabotage had caused the damage while Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday accused the United States and its allies of blowing up the pipelines. Washington has said it was too early to confirm it was sabotage, and dismissed talk it was responsible.

Norway, Europe's largest gas supplier and a major oil exporter, has more than 90 petroleum fields, most of which are connected to a network of gas pipelines stretching some 9,000 km (5,590 miles).

Norway is deploying its navy, coast guard and air force to beef up oil and gas security.

""We're in a dialogue with our allies regarding increased presence in the Norwegian (offshore) sector and have said yes to contributions from Germany, France and Britain,"" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told a news conference.

""It's natural that our allies sail alongside our ships,"" he said.

Stoere did not say how much assistance Norway, a NATO member nation of just 5.4 million people, would receive.

He repeated that the country had no indications of direct threats to Norway or Norwegian infrastructure, but said it was nevertheless prudent to beef up security.

“It is with humility that I want to accept and acknowledge that I and others did not always behave in a way which encouraged Ireland and the European Union to trust us, to accept that they have legitimate interests, legitimate interests that we are willing to respect.

“Because they do and we are willing to respect them, and I am sorry about that, because relations with Ireland are not where they should be and we all need to work extremely hard to improve that and I know that we are doing so.”

Britain’s relations with both Brussels and Dublin have soured further over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which Liz Truss’s government has blamed for trade friction.ave soured further over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which Liz Truss’s Government has blamed for trade friction."
1065751029,20221002,"European Union officials pledged a “robust and united response” to any deliberate disruption of the bloc’s energy infrastructure, a day after two Russian gas pipelines ruptured in the Baltic Sea.

“All available information indicates leaks are the result of a deliberate act,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement Wednesday, stressing that such damages are “not a coincidence and affects us all.”

“Deliberate disruption of European energy infrastructure is utterly unacceptable and will be met with a robust and united response,” Borrell added.

Borrell was referring to a series of unexplained leaks in Russia’s shuttered Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which served to convey natural gas to Europe via Germany.

The ruptures had no immediate effect on European energy supplies, as Germany froze Nord Stream 2 operations in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow halted flows via Nord Stream 1 several weeks ago.

But experts expressed concern on Tuesday about the resulting environmental pollution from the leaks, which occurred following multiple blasts recorded by Swedish and Norwegian seismologists.

The Danish military likewise confirmed the disturbance with images of bubbles in the same section of the Baltic Sea.

While multiple countries situated near the pipelines pointed to suspected sabotage early on Tuesday, the Biden administration initially declined to speculate on the cause of the leaks.

But by Tuesday evening, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with their counterparts in Denmark about the pipeline leaks, which they described as “apparent sabotage.”

“I spoke to my counterpart Jean-Charles Ellermann-Kingombe of Denmark about the apparent sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines,” Sullivan wrote on Twitter. “The U.S. is supporting efforts to investigate and we will continue our work to safeguard Europe’s energy security.”

Minutes later, State Department spokesperson Ned Price released a statement using a similar description, adding that the U.S. is united with its allies in its “commitment to promoting European energy security.”

On Wednesday morning, the European Union followed up with a statement stressing that it is “deeply concerned about damage to the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that has resulted in leaks in the international waters of the Baltic Sea.”

“We will support any investigation aimed at getting full clarity on what happened and why, and will take further steps to increase our resilience in energy security,” the statement said.

In Germany, meanwhile, security agencies expressed fears that the Nord Stream pipelines could be destroyed forever, according to German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.

If the infrastructure is not repaired quickly, salt water could rush in and corrode the pipelines, government officials told Tagesspiegel.

In response to claims that Russia might be behind the pipeline ruptures, the Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed any such possibility.

“That’s quite predictable and also predictably stupid,” Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on a daily conference call reported by Reuters.

Peskov said that both pipelines are filled with expensive gas and that Russia is not interested in losing “a route for gas supplies to Europe,” according to Reuters.

If, however, Moscow was found responsible for the alleged sabotage, climate economist Gernot Wagner said that “a ‘robust and united response’ is precisely what is necessary in light of this apparent attack on EU energy security.”

“Putin is testing European resolve in lots of ways here,” Wagner, a senior lecturer at the Columbia Business School, told The Hill in an email. “A united EU response, that puts this leak in the context of Putin’s war of choice and the broader EU security questions is absolutely key here.”

What exactly that response might entail is unclear.

“If it is found to be Russian underwater drones or divers that made the attack, I am not clear on what, if any, military action might look like,” said Morgan Bazilian, a public policy professor at the Colorado School of Mines and former energy specialist at the World Bank.

Nonetheless, Bazilian stressed that in almost any scenario, the Nord Stream leaks appear to be “the final straw and the end to Russian and European energy trade.”

“Russia would pivot to Asian buyers, and Europe will ramp up even further their efficiency efforts, diversity of gas supply, and moves to renewable fuels,” Bazilian added.

1065756316,20221002,"TEQUA, West Bank (AP) — A throng of men clutching the body of a 7-year-old Palestinian boy marched through a town in the occupied West Bank toward the child’s final resting place on Friday, a day after his parents say he died from fear of Israeli soldiers.

Rayan Suleiman, with bright eyes and a backpack emblazoned with an animated race car, was walking home from school on Thursday when his family says he and his brothers were chased by Israeli soldiers. After the boys bolted home, the troops banged furiously on the door and threatened to arrest the children, their parents say. Just moments later, Rayan, the youngest of the three brothers, was dead.

The story shot across the occupied West Bank, providing an emotive focus for fury over Israel’s military tactics and what Palestinians contend is their victimization by the Israeli occupation. The Israeli army called the death a tragedy and said its soldiers were not to blame.

Heavily armed Israeli soldiers routinely arrest Palestinian children in the West Bank, where nearly half a million Israeli settlers live on land that Palestinians want for a future independent state.

Rayan’s death also struck a nerve with Palestinian parents. Fear for their children’s safety and the dread of soldiers knocking on the door are part of daily life under an entrenched Israeli military rule that is now in its 56th year.

“He was just an innocent boy, just 7 years old, what can he do?” Yasser Suleiman, Rayan’s father, told The Associated Press outside the hospital morgue on Friday, choking back tears.

The State Department demanded an investigation. The European Union said it was “shocked” by Rayan’s “tragic death.” U.N. Mideast envoy Tor Wennesland said he was “saddened” and called for an immediate probe.

Photographs of Rayan’s tiny, lifeless body under a sheet in the hospital became a potent new symbol overnight, threatening to fuel already heightened tensions just a day after the deadliest Israeli raid since the military escalated its crackdown on the West Bank earlier this year.

And like many such incidents in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, his death has sparked contention. The Israeli military has denied any violence in the interaction with Rayan’s family, saying that just one officer came to the family’s house after spotting children throwing stones.

Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesman, said the officer spoke in a “very calm manner” with Rayan’s father and left.

“There was no violence, no entry into the house,” Hecht said.

Rayan’s father said his son collapsed after he saw the Israeli soldiers who chased him appear at his front door. Yasser Suleiman said he was trying to reason with the soldiers, who accused his children of throwing rocks. The soldiers threatened to return at night and arrest all three children, including Rayan’s older brothers, ages 8 and 10, Suleiman said. Rayan tried to run away and fell on the floor, unconscious.

“He died of fear on the spot,” Suleiman said.

Doctors at a hospital in Beit Jala, a Palestinian town south of Jerusalem, could not resuscitate him. A pediatric specialist, Dr. Mohamed Ismail, said Rayan was healthy and had no previous medical conditions.

“The most probable scenario of what happened is that under stress, he had excess adrenaline secretion, which caused the increase of his heart beat,” Ismail said. “He developed cardiac arrest.”

A forensic doctor is currently conducting an autopsy on Rayan. Until the doctor makes his determination, no death certificate will be issued.

In the meantime on Friday, mourners thronged his body outside his stone house in Tequa, a Palestinian town that borders an Israeli settlement with some 4,000 residents. They kissed his head and feet, shrouded in a Palestinian flag.

“God is great!” they shouted, some jogging to stay ahead of his small body on the wooden pallet. “Oh Rayan, light of the eye!”

At the Suleiman house on Friday afternoon, women wept and wailed over Rayan’s bed, displayed in the family’s courtyard along with his English school books. His mother was crumpled over, inconsolably crying and calling out for her son. Extended family with watery eyes milled about in mourning.

Rayan’s aunt, who was home at the time of the incident, said even she was terrified when Israeli soldiers burst into the home. She said they handed her a paper in Hebrew she couldn’t read and yelled, ‘We want the boys, where are the boys?’”

“The kids are always in danger, from settlers from the army, on their way back from school,” said Rayan’s aunt, who gave her name as Umm Ali, noting that soldiers sometimes patrol a verdant shortcut that kids take from school to their homes. “Rayan is not the first one, he is only the latest.”

His brothers are refusing to go to school again out of fear, she added.

Palestinians have seized on Rayan’s death as the latest Israeli provocation as deadly violence rises in the West Bank. The Israeli military has conducted almost nightly raids into cities and towns to arrest suspects. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed, making 2022 the deadliest in seven years.

Human rights groups say that across the West Bank, Palestinian children live under constant threat of violence. Under Israeli military law, Palestinian children age 12 and above can go to prison for six months. Israel arrests hundreds of teenagers during night raids each year, bundling them handcuffed and blindfolded into armored cars for interrogation, reported Israeli human rights organization, HaMoked.

“That’s hugely traumatizing for the teenage kids being arrested and for their mothers and fathers,” said Jessica Montell, executive director of HaMoked. “In this case, it was fatally traumatizing for this little boy.”

After Rayan’s funeral, small crowds of young men cursed and hurled rocks at Israeli armored vehicles rumbling through the streets of Tequa."
