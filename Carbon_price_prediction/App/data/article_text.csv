20220117,"On Jan. 13, the Nigerian government lifted the suspension of Twitter, ending a seven-month embargo of the microblogging site in Africa’s most populous nation. However, it appears that the lifting of the Twitter suspension came with a rolling back of freedom of expression, as demanded by the government and with the acquiescence of the tech company.

The reinstatement came after Twitter “agreed to meet all the conditions” made by the Nigerian government, according to a statement by Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, the government’s lead in the Nigeria-Twitter negotiations. The conditions included Twitter’s legal registration in Nigeria, the payment of taxes, and the agreement to abide by Nigerian law to manage prohibited content.

Did Twitter throw Nigeria's digital rights under the bus?

The tech company has neither denied nor confirmed the deal with the Nigerian government that led to Twitter’s unblocking in the country. Rather, the company tweeted an evasive diplomatic statement stating that their mission in the country is “to serve the public conversation.” The tech company, while keeping silent about the specifics of the agreement with the Nigerian government, emphasized that they are “deeply committed to Nigeria.”

Some users on Twitter criticized the company's response.

Media reports supported the Nigerian government's version of events that the government did not back off from the fight against Twitter without gaining some concessions from the tech company. Rather, Twitter agreed to the conditions made by the government, which will further clamp down on Nigeria’s citizens’ digital rights.

On Jan. 13, a report by the BBC stated that it “understands” that Twitter “has largely agreed to the government demands.” Similarly, journalists Abubakar Idris and Peter Guest of Rest of the World affirmed that “Twitter had agreed to all of the government’s demands in November 2021.” However, government bureaucracy delayed the announcement until January.

It remains to be seen the effect of Twitter's deal with Nigeria in these three areas: legal registration in Nigeria, taxation, and co-management of prohibited content according to Nigerian laws.

Specifically, Twitter has enrolled the Nigerian government in both its Partner Support Panel (PSP) and Law Enforcement Portals (LEP). These two “taken together” were described by government negotiator Abdullahi as “a comprehensive compliance apparatus.”

The PSP is Twitter’s dedicated reporting channel for the tech company’s global partner organizations that allows the organizations to rapidly report suspected violations of Twitter community rules directly to the company. As of July 2019, Twitter had over 80 European Union partners — election monitoring or research organizations, universities, and academics — on the PSP. Hence, Nigeria’s inclusion on the PSP is not so unique.

Similarly, Nigerian law enforcement agencies will now be able “to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian laws.” Twitter already has detailed guidelines for law enforcement and a publicly available portal for law enforcers or government officials to submit a legal request for an “account information or content removal,” and Nigerian law enforcement will now have access to this portal.

A repeat of India squeeze or Russia’s throttling of Twitter?

In the past, Twitter has struggled to adequately protect and stand up for the digital rights and freedom of speech of its users, especially in countries with a form of digital authoritarianism.

In India, even though Twitter promised to defend freedom of speech, it took down accounts that belonged to media organizations, journalists, and activists. The tech company, at the request of the Indian government, removed more than 500 accounts, including accounts from journalists and media outlets, for protesting against the Indian Prime Minister’s policies that affected Indian farmers. In a similar incident, Twitter succumbed to requests from the government of Russia and removed about 60 percent of specific tweets “banned” in Russia, after the government slowed down the speed of Twitter’s services in the country.

Twitter vaguely agreeing to the Nigerian government’s request, via Twitter’s Law Enforcement Platform, to take action against content its suspects violates the country’s laws, is certainly worrying and affects the democratic framework of Nigeria. Nigeria’s journalist Tola Owoyele fears that this deal grants the government “a degree of access to Twitter, such that tweets that are deemed unpalatable or unfriendly to the government can be monitored and filtered. This would enable the government [to] track down Twitter users.”

The final call on account information and content removal requests remains with the tech company. But in practice, considering Twitter's compliance with the Indian and Russian government's demands, a similar occurrence in Nigeria is most probable.

This Nigerian government has consistently worked to stifle citizens’ ability to use online platforms to participate in governance. In 2019, the Nigerian government proposed a controversial social media bill that legalizes internet blackout and criminalizes any criticism of the official narrative.

With the Nigerian government’s temperamental past, the violation of citizens’ online freedom of expression will be much easier because Twitter is now a company registered under Nigerian laws and taxable in the country. In addition, this agreement made between Twitter and the government, without any civil society organization involvement, gives the Nigerian government enormous power to control the social media platform."

The visit came as part of the ongoing negotiations for the future relationship of Gibraltar with the European Union. The delegation was shown the air terminal, the border, the port and the geographical layout from the top of the Rock.

Number Six says the objective was to provide the EU visitors with a better understanding of the situation on the ground in the context of the removal of controls at the land border and the creation of a bespoke common travel area between Gibraltar and Schengen.

20220127,"AFRICA’S democratic credentials are under a severe test after soldiers seized power again in Burkina Faso on Monday. Claiming to be on a mission to save the West African country from insecurity and poverty, mutinous soldiers toppled the President, Roch Kabore, who was in his second term in office. In a telling irony, the ECOWAS, the United Nations, the European Union, the African Union, the United States, France, and China condemned the coup, but thousands of ordinary Burkinabe trooped to the streets to celebrate it. Regardless of the misguided sentiments of the people, it is another step backwards; a military takeover of a democratic government is an aberration.

Classified by the World Bank as a low-income country, Burkina Faso has been plagued by violence for decades. Monday’s coup was preceded by mutiny in several military barracks across the country. Coordinated by the self-styled ‘Patriotic Movement for Safeguarding and Restoration’, and led by Paul-Henri Damiba, a lieutenant colonel, to justify their power grab, the coup plotters accused Kabore, who first won election in 2015, of incompetence, bad governance, inability to curb the rampant violent attacks and neglect of the military.

Early prognosis indicates that the coup is nothing but a lunge for power by military adventurists. It is unlikely to bring succour to a country afflicted by deep socioeconomic troubles. Since Thomas Sankara, who had also assumed power via a coup in 1983, was violently deposed as president in 1987, Burkina Faso has continued to witness military rebellion. Blaise Compaore, his successor, transmuted to a democratic ruler in 1991, winning flawed elections four times.

But the Burkinabe people grew weary of Compaore. He was toppled in 2014 following street protests. He took refuge in Ivory Coast. Not surprisingly, his ouster did not bring peace or economic progress. Instead, Islamic insurgency and restiveness took root. For a country of 20.9 million people and a GDP of $17.93 billion, inescapably, this points to incessant unrest.

Al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates have exploited the situation to kidnap and slaughter civilians and security agents. In January 2016, an attack on Splendid Hotel and a restaurant in Ouagadougou killed 30 people, most of them Western tourists. Between 132 and 160 people were killed in a June 2021 attack on the Solhan village, deemed the worst attack in the six years to that time. In August 2021, attackers killed 65 civilians and 15 police officers in northern Burkina Faso. Attacks now occur almost daily. All this prepared the ground for the putschists.

Unfortunately, Burkina Faso is not alone in the mad rush by the military to hijack power from the civilians in Africa. A study by American researchers, Jonathan Powell and Clayton Thyne of the School of Politics, Security and International Studies, University of Kentucky, identified over 200 coups in Africa since the late 1950s. Five West African countries have had between seven and eight military coups each. Niger and Chad have each recorded seven coups. Nigeria, Guinea Bissau, Mali, and Benin Republic have experienced eight coups apiece since 1952. Burkina Faso has recorded one failed, and eight successful coups, the same with Comoros. Sierra Leone and Ghana have had 10 coups apiece.

In the past 18 months, coup-making has returned forcefully to the continent. In West Africa, formerly described as the “coup belt,” the military has taken power in Mali (twice), Guinea and Chad (it failed). There have been attempts in Ethiopia and Central African Republic during the period. This is nothing compared to the situation in Sudan. The North African country has experienced a record 17 coups to date, the last two in September and October 2021. This is a high toll. It makes Africa the most coup-ravaged continent on Earth.

The Burkina Faso conundrum replicates itself around Africa. In August 2020 and May 2021, the military, led by Assimi Goïta (a colonel), seized power in Mali, the second time in nine months. His group overthrew the democratically elected Boubacar Keita and the interim president, Bah Ndaw. Guinea suffered the same fate in September 2021 when special forces commander, Mamady Doumbouya (a colonel), overthrew Alpha Conde.

All this is a major blight on Africa. Political instability invariably consigns the continent to perpetual economic underdevelopment. Juxtaposed with its population and economic state, Africa remains a backward continent. According to the IMF, Africa’s 2021 GDP of $2.60 trillion or 2.84 per cent of the global figure, is a far cry from Europe’s $23.48 trillion (24.73 per cent), North America’s $26.79 trillion (28.22 per cent) and Asia’s $36.81 trillion (38.78 per cent). Credited with 1.3 billion persons, Africa had the second highest population behind Asia’s 4.6 billion in 2020.

Therefore, Africans ought to take their destinies in their own hands and instil an era of democratic order to escape the prevailing despotic governance. ECOWAS, which has mediated in Mali since August 2020 without a tangible outcome, should design fresh measures against the military usurpers, including working with the Western powers to ostracise the coup plotters. Nigeria, a leading member of ECOWAS, should flatly reject the coup in Burkina Faso and put pressure on the invaders to relinquish power to an elected government. Even after leaving office, coup leaders should be prosecuted anywhere they escape to in the world.

The AU should wake up. By collaborating with other continental blocs and the UN, the coup plotters should not be allowed to enjoy a day in office through sanctions. They should have their travelling visas revoked. France, the former colonial master of Burkina Faso, should take the lead.

This is also a vital lesson for sit-tight rulers in Africa. The African Big Man syndrome prevents institution building and promotes instability. From Cameroon to Gabon, Eswatini to Equatorial Guinea, and Uganda to Congo, the story is the same. This has imposed political turmoil on much of Africa. For the continent to reach its potential, democracy should be allowed to flourish, rescuing Africa from its self-inflicted ignominy.

20220128,"Earlier this month, the United States withdrew its support for the EastMed Pipeline, a proposed $6 billion seabed route that would have linked natural gas discoveries off Israel and Cyprus to facilities in mainland Greece and even Italy. When informing the governments of Greece, Israel, and Cyprus of its new position, the Biden administration cited economic and environmental concerns. Previously, the European Union announced that it was withdrawing as well, as part of its wider shift away from oil and gas projects.

EastMed’s commercial viability had always been questionable to many analysts. Amos Hochstein, the State Department’s senior advisor for global energy security, has long been a skeptic, reportedly once dubbing the project a “pipedream” even as former Israeli energy minister Yuval Steinitz was enthusiastically endorsing it. A long seabed pipeline in deep water is expensive to build and maintain, and low natural gas prices would have made it only marginally profitable at best. Additionally, the volume of gas needed to fill the pipe has still not been discovered years after the project was announced.

Another problem has been Turkey’s stance on the southern boundary of its exclusive economic zone, which would extend beyond the pipeline’s route and therefore give Ankara grounds to raise objections. The logic behind Turkey’s expansive territorial claim is questionable, but that would not negate the possibility of legal impediments.

The U.S. decision is a killing blow to the project. And the fact that it coincides with the Ukraine crisis will likely sound the death knell for Israel’s dreams of becoming an alternative to Russia as a significant gas supplier to Europe. Jerusalem’s hopes of building a significant sovereign wealth fund from the revenues have dimmed as well.

A cold look at the statistics illustrates Israel’s limitations. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, the country had proven gas reserves of 600 billion cubic meters (bcm) at the end of 2020, or just 0.3% of the global total. By contrast, the world’s top three gas countries were Russia with 37,400 bcm (19.9%), Iran with 32,100 bcm (17.1%), and Qatar with 20,700 bcm (13.1%). Even U.S. reserves (12,600 bcm, or 6.7%) dwarfed Israel’s.

In terms of consumption, Europe uses about 540 bcm annually. Russia reportedly provides about 40% of this, or more than 200 bcm. Yet exports from Israel’s offshore Leviathan field are only around 10 bcm, and the output from its other major field (Tamar) is used to meet domestic power demand.

Although Israel, Greece, and Cyprus are no doubt disappointed about the withdrawal of U.S. and EU support, the project has served the valuable purpose of bringing them together diplomatically. The shift is unlikely to bring Turkey into the fold, however. Ankara remains a staunch regional rival to Greece and Cyprus, while President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s longstanding coolness toward Israel will likely curb any near-term prospects of Turkey buying its spare gas. The two governments do not yet trust each other enough to make the major investments needed for a pipeline.

Another proposal remains on the table: establishing a high-voltage electricity interconnector to transfer surplus generated power between Israel, Cyprus, and Greece. Yet this plan is questionable as well—besides the great distances involved (more than 1,300 miles), a rival project has emerged for an Egypt-Cyprus-Greece interconnector, and the routes for both proposals may face Turkish legal objections.

This year will see further gas exploration and drilling of development wells in existing discoveries off the coasts of Israel, Egypt, and Cyprus. In all likelihood, however, any new discoveries will be important only in East Mediterranean terms rather than European terms. Investors are still contemplating the implications of last month’s speech by current Israeli energy minister Karine Elharrar, who noted that her office would be focusing on renewables in 2022 (specifically solar and wind). Israel’s gas may end up being a shorter-term, less-profitable boon than expected.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has told seven GOP governors that their state’s National Guard members must comply with the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

We’ll break down his response to their concerns, plus Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments on security demands and the Pentagon deciding to appeal an order to drain fuel tanks at a Hawaii storage facility.

For The Hill, I’m Jordan Williams. Write to me with tips at jwilliams@thehill.com.

Let’s get to it.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has informed seven GOP governors that their state’s National Guard members must be vaccinated against COVID-19, the latest in the ongoing dispute between Republican leaders and the Pentagon over the mandate.

Austin sent nearly identical letters last week to each of the governors who in mid-December asked him to drop the mandate, saying he had no power to implement it to Guard members, who are under state authority.

In his response, Austin said he had the power to implement the mandate “regardless of duty status,” adding that concerns over the vaccine “do not negate the need for this important military readiness requirement.”

Who got a letter? Austin sent letters to Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Idaho Gov. Brad Little, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts and Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, all of whom signed on to a letter in mid-December asking him to drop the requirement.

He also sent a letter to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who separately sent a letter in protest of the mandate and then sued the Pentagon, seeking to block it.

What Austin said: Austin warned that failing to comply “will lead to a prohibition on participation in drills, training, and other duty conducted under title 32 and will jeopardize the member’s status in the National Guard.”

The Pentagon chief told Abbott and Dunleavy that he couldn’t comment further on the “substance” of their concerns due to the ongoing litigation.

“COVID-19 takes our Service members out of the fight, temporarily or permanently, and jeopardizes our ability to meet mission requirements,” he wrote.

“To ensure that we maintain a healthy and ready military force capable of accomplishing our mission to defend this Nation and to protect the American people, vaccination against COVID-19 is an essential military readiness requirement for all components and units of the military,” he continues.

The fight started in Oklahoma: Austin mandated vaccinations for the military in late August but left it up to each service to implement their own deadlines. Air National Guard members had until December to be inoculated, while Army National Guard members have until June 30 to comply.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) was the first to publicly oppose the mandate in November, when he asked Austin to exempt his state’s National Guard from the mandate.

Stitt later appointed a new adjutant general of the Guard, who wrote a memo stipulating that no member was required to get the shot.

Austin turned down that request, and the state of Oklahoma then unsuccessfully sought to have a federal court enjoin the mandate.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday accused the U.S. of leading it into a conflict with Ukraine that Moscow did not want while also lamenting demands for influence in Eastern Europe he said were being ignored.

Putin said in a news conference that the U.S. was trying to lead Russia into conflict in order to impose stiffer sanctions.

It was clear “that the principal Russian concerns turned out to be ignored,” he said, according to The New York Times reported.

Exchanging demands: Russia has demanded that NATO not expand any more toward the east and also ban Ukraine from joining the military alliance. The U.S. has deemed these conditions to be non-starters.

On Monday, Russia delivered a written response to the United States’ proposal, with the contents left undisclosed. The State Department stated that it would be “unproductive to negotiate in public.”

A written response by the U.S. last week was also not disclosed, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov indicated it had not satisfactorily addressed Russia’s demands.

“The document contains no positive response on the main issue” of Russia’s demands, Peskov said, though he added that it contained elements that could lead to “the start of a serious talk on secondary issues.”

Blinken speaks with Russian counterpart: Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the latest diplomatic outreach in the United States’ effort to stave off what officials fear is an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Blinken “emphasized the U.S. willingness, bilaterally and together with Allies and partners, to continue a substantive exchange with Russia on mutual security concerns,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement.

The secretary reemphasized U.S. support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and called for Russia to draw down an estimated 100,000 troops stationed near its border with Ukraine.

“He emphasized that further invasion of Ukraine would be met with swift and severe consequences and urged Russia to pursue a diplomatic path,” Price said in the statement.

Something to watch for: The White House is dispatching its top cyber official to Europe for meetings with allies on countering cyberthreats from Russia, a senior Biden administration official said.

Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, is expected to meet with her European Union counterparts and NATO representatives in Brussels this week, according to the official.

Neuberger will also travel to Warsaw to meet with Polish and Baltic officials and members of the Bucharest Nine, which includes the NATO members Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

The Pentagon has decided it will fight Hawaii’s order to drain fuel from tanks at a storage facility following a leak that contaminated Pearl Harbor’s drinking water, a top Defense official said Monday.

The Defense Department first said earlier this month that the Navy would comply with the emergency order from the Hawaii Department of Health to empty the underground tanks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The order came after the facility’s leak contaminated the Navy’s drinking water system for 93,000 people, sickening numerous military families.

But after a Monday meeting with Hawaii Gov. David Ige (D) to discuss “how we can work together through some pending legal matters,” Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said the Pentagon would file an appeal to fight the state order.

Previously on Red Hill: The order was initially released in December and stipulated that the Navy must drain the fuel tanks and not use them again until it can prove it can do so safely.

Navy officials earlier this month told lawmakers that the service would “comply” with the order to defuel the facility, with U.S. Pacific Fleet Deputy Commander Rear Adm. Blake Converse calling it a “lawful order.”

So, what now? Hicks said DOD officials are still working to address the fuel contamination and would submit a work plan and implementation schedule for a “qualified, independent third party commercial firm” to assess Red Hill’s system integrity by April 30. The plan is due by Wednesday, as required by the emergency order.

She also said the department “will continue to do everything that we can to protect the population, the environment, and the security of the nation,” and hasn’t ruled out “the option of permanently defueling Red Hill.”

In addition, the Pentagon is working on a separate assessment to scrutinize the distribution of its fuel reserves in the Pacific, to be completed within 60 days to “enable the Secretary of Defense to make a decision on the role of Red Hill moving forward.”

Lawmakers react: Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz (D) said the move is a “grave and unforced error that undermines public trust.”

“Fortunately, we have civilian oversight of the military, and this inexplicable and maddening resistance to the defuel order will not succeed. They will lose in court, and they will lose in Congress,” Schatz wrote on Twitter.

Rep. Ed Case (D), who represents the districts the fuel leak affected, said in a statement that he strongly disagrees with the military’s decision.

“I will do everything I can to fully effectuate the order and, if necessary, to confirm that Hawai’i and any other state is legally entitled to protect its drinking water,” Case said in a statement.

Rep. Kai Kahele (D), meanwhile, called the Pentagon’s appeal “a betrayal to the people of Hawaii.”

“There is no more precious resource than our water,” Kahele wrote on Twitter. “If they are incapable of being a good neighbor and stewards of our environment, they must shut down Red Hill. I will do everything I can to protect Hawai’i’s drinking water.”

20220202,"In a divisive decision by the European Commission, natural gas and nuclear energy can be classified as “sustainable investment” if certain targets are met, reported BBC News. Some members of the commission strongly oppose the plan, which has divided the European Union (EU) and led to accusations of “greenwashing.”

Classifying the power sources as green is not a requirement for gas or nuclear investment, EU officials said. Rather, the classification adds to the “EU Taxonomy,” a set of rules that establishes what can be called “sustainable,” as a guide to private investors.

Chancellor of Austria Karl Nehammer’s response to the new classification was that “nuclear power is neither green nor sustainable,” BBC News reported.

“I cannot understand the decision of the EU,” Nehammer said.

The EU Taxonomy rules are meant to acknowledge enterprises that make a “substantial” contribution to the environmental objectives set out by the EU, “while not significantly harming any” of its goals, reported BBC News.

Austria and Luxembourg have threatened legal action over the “green” classification for gas and nuclear, but the decision to label them “green” isn’t yet final — the European Council and Parliament have four months to object to the action.

During this time, the final rules could be vetoed by either a super-majority of 20 of the 27 EU member countries or a majority of members of European Parliament, reported Reuters.

The Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark oppose the inclusion of gas in the taxonomy, and Austria and Luxembourg, which strongly oppose nuclear energy, have threatened to sue the commission, The Washington Post reported.

Leonore Gewessler, the climate minister of Austria, has referred to the inclusion of nuclear and gas in the classification of what is sustainable as a “cloak-and-dagger operation,” reported The Washington Post.

France has expressed that nuclear power has an important role in tackling climate change, Reuters reported. About 70 percent of France’s power comes from nuclear energy. And for some central and eastern European countries, gas is seen as a necessary bridge in moving away from coal.

Environmental groups have condemned the plan, with Greenpeace calling it an “anti-science plan,” saying that it “represents the biggest greenwashing exercise of all time,” reported The Washington Post.

Even investment groups BlackRock and Vanguard have expressed that the move would hurt the EU’s credibility. In an open letter to the representatives of the EU, the investment firms said that the inclusion of gas in the EU Taxonomy would “seriously compromise Europe’s status as a global leader in sustainable finance,” as The Washington Post reported.

According to Reuters, last week expert advisers to the Commission said the draft rules concerning gas and nuclear did not support the climate change targets for the EU, which include a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

“Is [the E.U.] a green leader globally, or is it a global leader in greenwashing?” asked University College Dublin Professor Andreas Hoepner, one of a group of experts who provided guidance on the taxonomy to the EU, reported The Washington Post."
20220208,"""If the other party does not fulfill the agreement, we have the right to terminate it. This is certainly the situation between Poland and the European Union,"" Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said when asked about the possibility of Poland giving up 270 billion zlotys it is to receive from the EU Reconstruction Fund. The politician also pointed to the authors of this concept, which was publicly presented by Law and Justice (PiS) MEP Adam Bielan.""The policy of concessions in the face of unlawful demands of the European Union leads to aggression and further demands,"" Ziobro commented on the decision of the European Commission, which will proceed to deduct payments for penalties imposed by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Turow mine case.The Reconstruction Fund is an aid package for EU economies after the coronavirus pandemic. Poland has been allocated 270 billion zlotys under it, but so far the country has not received even the first tranche of the money.The European Commission has not issued an opinion on the National Reconstruction Plan, which stipulates how the obtained funds will be spent.Earlier, it wants concessions from the Polish government on judiciary issues. For this reason, President Andrzej Duda recently announced his bill on changes to the Supreme Court.Ziobro, the leader of Solidarna Polska (United Poland) junior coalitionist was also asked about the words of Bielan, who suggested that Poland may resign from EU funds: ""We will have to make some kind of decision, possibly even about withdrawing from the European reconstruction plan,"" the minister said.""This idea came from the Foreign Ministry, the authors should be sought there,"" he added."
20220209,"On 24 December 2019, the first iteration of the Upstream Petroleum Resources Development Bill (“UPRDB”) was published for public comment. The UPRDB introduces a separation of the upstream petroleum exploration and production sector from the mining sector, which is currently both regulated under the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, No. 28 of 2002 (“MPRDA”). Written comments on the UPRDB from industry stakeholders were required to be submitted by 21 February 2020, and Government consultations with industry stakeholders were conducted by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (“DMRE”) and the Petroleum Agency (the “Task Team”) between April and May 2020. National Treasury issued a tax policy discussion paper on 17 December 2021, to be read alongside the UPRDB, which sets out certain key proposals on the taxation of upstream oil and gas activities.

A second iteration of the UPRDB was published on 14 June 2021, following the Minister of the DMRE’s (“Minister”) explanatory summary published in the Government Gazette wherein he declared his intent to introduce the UPRDB to the National Assembly. It was evident from this version of the UPRDB that the Task Team made a concerted effort to take into account the concerns raised by the industry stakeholders. The UPRDB was introduced to the National Assembly on 1 July 2021 and was tagged an “ordinary bill affecting the provinces”. Consequently, it must be considered by both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.

The provisions put forth by the UPRDB are encouraging. The current draft of the UPRDB consists of comprehensive transitional provisions to ensure security of tenure of existing permits or rights by giving holders of such permits and rights an opportunity to transition to the provisions of the UPRDB. A signification development is the introduction of the petroleum right, which governs the key terms of both the exploration and production phase. The petroleum right will replace the granting of separate exploration rights and production rights. In addition, a petroleum right may only be granted to a company incorporated in South Africa and an interest in a petroleum right must be held by a South African incorporated company. This will encourage both foreign investment and local participation in the oil and gas industry.

A new permit is introduced by the UPRDB, namely the retention permit. A retention permit is granted in cases where development and production of petroleum is not possible due to unfavorable market or economic conditions. The retention permit would suspend the terms and conditions of the petroleum right so as to allow the holder to wait for a positive shift in market conditions, prior to making an investment decision.

The UPRDB proposes two methods for the acquisition of permits and the petroleum right, namely, (1) applications-by-invitation and (2) unsolicited applications. Applications-by-invitation is then subdivided into a further two methods namely, (a) competitive administrative licensing rounds or (b) open licensing rounds, both of which are initiated by the Minister.

Under the provisions regulating competitive administrative licensing rounds, the Minister may invite applications for a petroleum right in respect of a specific block/s by Government Gazette, and assess each application based on the holders technical and financial ability, and compliance with the prescribed criteria. Open licensing rounds, whilst also initiated by notice in the Government Gazette, will be processed on a first come first serve basis.

An unsolicited application only applies to applications for reconnaissance permits, which can be submitted at any time, without the need for the Minister to publish an invitation.

The oil and gas sector has the potential to contribute to the much-needed boost to the South African economy as well as improve energy security for the country. Whilst rich in its natural resources, South Africa faces severe energy poverty, and we are therefore encouraged by the European Union’s recent proposal to label natural gas as a ‘green’ energy source in the movement toward a just energy transition. This proposal, coupled with the legislative certainty the UPRDB brings, will undeniably contribute greatly to our economy."
20220216,"One issue emerging from Russia's aggression against Ukraine is the question of energy supply. Russia supplies Ukraine as well as Central, Southern, and Western Europe with natural gas through many pipelines, several of which traverse Ukraine. As Russia’s massive military buildup around Ukraine’s borders (and in Russia-occupied Crimea and Russia-controlled parts of the Donbas) continues, Russia is also throttling gas delivery – a provocative move that it began last summer.

 

 The U.S.-European Union Energy Council stated during its meeting on February 7 that “it is unacceptable to use energy supply as a weapon or geopolitical lever.” Thus, the United States and the European Union agreed once again to work together to address any potential threat to energy supply in the European Union or in its vicinity.

 

 Indeed, Russia has used a stoppage of gas delivery as a cudgel in the past. “When Russia halted gas supplies to Europe over a dispute with Ukraine in 2009, people died from the cold,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

“When energy supplies fail, economies falter. We’re determined to prevent that from happening and to mitigate the impact on energy supplies and prices should Russia choose to cut natural gas supplies to Europe.”

 

 “We’re taking steps to ensure that the global energy supply isn’t disrupted – that too is an important focus – should Russia choose to weaponize its natural gas by cutting supply to Europe even more than it’s already done,” said Secretary Blinken.

 

 “We’re in discussions with governments and major producers around the world about surging their capacity. We’re engaged in detailed conversations with our allies and partners about coordinating our response, including how best to deploy their existing energy stockpiles. All this effort is aimed at mitigating price shocks and ensuring that people in the United States, Europe, and around the world have the energy they need no matter what Russia decides to do.”

 

 The United States and the European Union support a strong and resilient Ukraine, and both know that energy security is vital to a sovereign Ukraine.

 

 “Energy security is tied directly to national security, regional security, global security. Europe needs reliable and affordable energy, especially in the winter months,” said Secretary Blinken. “We’re working together … to protect Europe’s energy supply against supply shocks including those that could result from further Russian aggression against Ukraine.”"

20220222,"President Biden’s strategy to confront Russian aggression against Ukraine is being put to the test.

Biden on Tuesday put into motion coordinated sanctions that were developed over months of intensive diplomacy among allies and aimed at imposing punishing consequences on Moscow.

The president also announced that he would send additional U.S. troops to Germany, Poland and Romania, where at least 6,000 American forces have been deployed in recent weeks to bolster the eastern flank members of NATO.

The administration has said its allies and partners are resolved to work in lockstep even amid concerns that disparate countries would pull punches on a sanctions package over the hit it could impose on their own economies, including in the U.S., based on differing interests, ties and reliance on Russian energy and investment.

Biden called the moves the first set of significant measures taken in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision a day earlier to recognize as independent, and aid militarily, breakaway regions in southeastern Ukraine.

“This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Biden said in remarks from the East Room of the White House. “I’m going to begin to impose sanctions … and if Russia goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further.”

The president announced full-blocking sanctions on a Russian development corporation, VEB bank, and Russian state lender Promsvyazbank, as well as targeting Russian sovereign debt to cut Moscow off from Western financing. The Biden administration also announced sanctions on five prominent Russians with links to the Kremlin and their family members.

This followed an initial limited sanctions order Monday night that prohibits investment and trade in the breakaway territories, Donetsk and Luhansk — the separatist-held areas that Putin, in a move setting up justification for an invasion, recognized as independent.

While administration officials insisted the sanctions were “severe,” some critics described them as insufficient. The measures did not include penalties such as kicking Russia out of the SWIFT international banking system, though Biden administration officials said that such a move was not off the table.

“Today’s sanctions are too little, too late,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement immediately following Biden’s announcement.

A senior Biden administration official warned that the U.S. is prepared to sanction other large Russian financial institutions, such as VTB Bank, if Moscow broadens its military invasion of Ukraine.

“This is the beginning of an invasion and this is the beginning of our response,” the official told reporters. “If Putin escalates further, we will escalate further.”

The White House has also threatened export controls that would prevent Russia from obtaining key U.S. technologies, and the official signaled those would be part of a later response to further Russian military aggression toward Ukraine.

Edward Fishman, adjunct fellow with the Center for a New American Security, tweeted that sanctions on VEB bank mark the first time the U.S. has used its toughest sanctions tool on a major state-owned Russian bank and signal that such action could be taken against more state-owned banks, including larger ones.

“If Putin intensifies aggression, I expect today’s action is just the tip of the iceberg,” he tweeted.

The actions by the U.S. are buoyed by sanctions measures and other commitments announced by a host of allies and partners, including Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan and Canada.

“At every step, we’ve shown the United States and our allies and partners are working in unison which he hasn’t been counting on — Mr. Putin,” the president said.

Germany, in particular, took the step of suspending certification for a Russia-to-Germany natural gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, keeping the completed pipeline offline.

Biden administration officials said the announcement followed consultations between the U.S. and Germany overnight Monday.

But Republicans critical of Biden’s approach to Nord Stream 2 and Democrats hawkish on Russia called for the president and Germany to go further by terminating the pipeline completely.

Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Germany should permanently suspend certifying the pipeline.

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the panel’s chairman, said in an interview with CNN that Biden should remove a waiver he issued in May that lifted sanctions on German entities involved in the pipeline’s operations, saying the U.S. should make sure that Nord Stream 2 “is officially dead.”

Menendez further called for Biden to impose the “overwhelming amount of [sanctions] now” but reserve cutting Russia off from the SWIFT financial system as a potential nuclear option.

“When is it that we’re going to be clear to Putin that there are severe consequences for what he’s doing? When he takes another bite after this bite?” he asked.

Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters in his home state that he was in consultation with Democrats about creating an interagency task force to go after Russian oligarchs.

“I want to see cops go in and take apartments, fine art, seize yachts from a bunch of thugs and crooks,” Graham said. “I want to put money on the table to have more weapons for Ukraine to fight. I want more protection when it comes to cyber, and I want to go at this big, and I want to go at it hard.”

In the United Kingdom, an initial sanctions package blacklisted three Russian billionaires who were already under U.S. sanctions: Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg, his nephew.

The U.K. also imposed sanctions on five Russian banks: Rossiya Bank, IS Bank, GenBank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank.

“We will curtail the ability of the Russian state and Russian companies to raise funds in our markets, prohibit a range of high tech exports, and further isolate Russian banks from the global economy,” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement. “These will be surgically targeted sanctions that will hit Russia hard.”

The European Union, for its part, announced a sanctions package that targeted all 351 members of the Russian legislature who voted to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk and blacklisted at least 27 Russian officials and institutions from the defense and banking world. They also imposed limits on Moscow’s access to EU capital and financial markets.

Japan committed to coordinating a “tough response,” including sanctions with other members of the Group of 7 (G-7). Russia was kicked out of the group, then the G-8, in 2014, for its invasion and annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.

Canada, a member of the G-7, also vowed to impose economic sanctions.

The sanctions on Russia by international governments were coupled with commitments to assist Ukraine’s economy, with the conflict wreaking havoc on businesses and local industry. Ukraine’s hryvnia, its currency, dropped to a seven-year low, Reuters reported.

Biden, in a meeting with Ukraine’s foreign minister in Washington on Tuesday, said the U.S. is committed to providing security assistance and macroeconomic support to Ukraine, according to a readout from the White House.

The U.S., along with NATO, have bolstered their military presence around Ukraine against Putin’s massing of close to 190,000 troops, which are squeezing the nation from multiple sides, from Belarus in the north, Russian troops near and inside the Donbas, forces in Russian-occupied Crimea and Russian war ships in the Black Sea.

“We are on the precipice of a dark and dangerous era,” Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said at a special Tuesday meeting in Vienna of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe."
20220222,"The bakery in the center of town offered poppy seed babka-like pastries and breads of various shades. The baker seemed reluctant to speak before blurting out that the shelling — always present but also far away — increased in recent days. She would have said more, but a tall, burly pensioner wearing an imposing gray coat and a black fur hat jumped in with his own opinion:

“Situation getting worse,” he said, alluding to the prospect that Russian troops may be on their way, before walking out without waiting for a response.

Not far away, in the central square, Dmitri Sergeivich, a 44-year-old who works at the nearby chemical plant, sat with two of his friends, joking and discussing the affairs of the day in the suddenly cool evening air. He gave an easy smile that belied his midlevel-street-enforcer looks.

“I live on a nearby mountain that looks into Donetsk, so I’m not worried,” he said, pointing to a sprinkling of houses on a nearby hill. Besides, he was sure no one would attack the chemical plant, which is owned by Ukraine’s richest oligarch, Rinat Akhmetov. It produces phenol, a toxic chemical precursor, and is often belching noxious fumes into the air. What would happen if an artillery round smacked into it?

“It wouldn’t be good,” he said, a serious undertone to his deadpan delivery. He added that though a lot of people had left the town in the eight years of war, and more were joining them now during this escalation, he intended to stay and take care of his 11-year-old daughter. Besides, the plant was still producing and exporting its goods to Turkey and elsewhere.

War may be headed in his direction but Sergeivich showed a sort of equanimity that has become a typical sight in Kyiv and other big cities these past few weeks. It was notable to find it here in New York, a few miles from the contact line that for years marked the tense stalemate between the Ukraine government and its Moscow-backed separatist adversaries — and a potential target for a Russian assault in its “peacekeeping” mission in Donbas.

Russia’s upper house of parliament unanimously approved that mission in a theatrics-heavy show of fealty to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, setting the stage for the deployment of Russian troops to eastern Ukraine a day after Putin formally recognized the independence of two breakaway republics. The European Union reported that troops had entered the separatist region earlier in the day. The question was how far into Ukraine they would push.

“The adoption of the decision by the Federation Council today … is aimed at establishing peace in the Donbas, at stopping this bloody civil war, in order to prevent further shelling of peaceful villages and civilians,” said upper chamber Speaker Valentina Matvienko, according to a report from Russian state news operator Tass. The step would also pave the way for establishing military bases on those territories.

A press briefing with Putin after the vote brought fresh fears of an all-out war in Ukraine when he told reporters that Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics encompassed a wider swath of territory than the separatists now hold.

His statement raises the specter that Russian troops could imminently penetrate farther into Ukraine, well beyond the “line of contact” between Ukrainian forces and the pro-Moscow separatists, who hold approximately a third of the Donbas. Putin also rejected the Minsk agreements, the accords that brought a stuttering cease-fire to eastern Ukraine in 2014, but with no proper resolution.

“The Minsk agreements do not exist now, we recognized the DNR and LNR,” Putin said, referring to the breakaway states by their official names, the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic.

Putin’s actions on Tuesday brought a chorus of international denunciations as well as a raft of economic sanctions from the U.S., U.K. and European Union. The most palpable blow, however, came from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said he would halt authorization of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set to provide a significant chunk of Europe’s gas.

Elsewhere, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia was moving from “covert attempts to destabilize Ukraine to overt military action,” adding that the crisis in Ukraine was the “most dangerous moment in European security for a generation.”

The diplomatic barbs continued even as fighting persisted along the contact line in the Donbas. Shelling from separatist forces struck a power station in the Ukrainian-controlled town of Shchastia, starting a fire and knocking out heat and electricity. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Tuesday that up to 9 p.m., territories under Ukrainian control had been shelled 80 times from the separatist region.

The Defense Ministry said that two of its soldiers were killed Tuesday and 12 others wounded in separatist shelling over the 24 hours before — adding to a toll of casualties in the conflict over the Donbas. Despite the recent escalation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky insisted — as he had many times in past weeks — that there would not be a full-on invasion.

“With regards to being on a military footing, we understand there will be no war,” Zelensky said. “There will not be an all-out war against Ukraine, and there will not be a broad escalation from Russia. If there is, then we will put Ukraine on a war footing.”

Russian diplomats believe Kyiv is already there. In a lengthy statement on Tuesday, the Russian Embassy said: “In the current circumstances, our first priority is to take care of Russian diplomats and employees of the Embassy and Consulates General.”

“To protect their lives and safety, the Russian leadership has decided to evacuate the personnel of Russian foreign missions in Ukraine,” the statement said.

Later, video uploaded to social media showed smoke coming out of the Russian Embassy building in the capital. The footage could not be verified by The Times.

But elsewhere it appeared that the waiting game of the last few weeks would continue for a few more days, and Ukrainians would endure it as they had for eight years, as they keep repeating to visiting journalists’ inquiries. Still, the rumors of war seem too loud to ignore, even for someone like Sergeivich.

“There are different ideas for this territory,” he said, referring to the Donbas.

“But I hope it will return to Ukraine.”"
20220222,"China’s state-run Global Times on Tuesday compared the Donbas region of Ukraine, currently overrun by two Russian-backed separatist entities, to the sovereign state of Taiwan, urging the G7 member countries to grant “unwavering support” to a Chinese invasion of the island.

The remark, published through the Global Times‘ Twitter account – which the propaganda outlet possesses despite a blanket ban on Twitter in China – was a response to mounting criticisms of Russian leader Vladimir Putin who announced on Monday that he would recognize the separatists of Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine, as two sovereign states. Putin ordered Russian “peacekeeping” troops into the Ukrainian territories to defend the separatists from the Ukrainian military. Russia has been fueling a war between its proxies and Ukraine in the region since 2014.

Putin’s recognition of the territories as states complicates China’s relationship with Russia, as Beijing refuses to recognize even actual sovereign states like Kosovo if other states claim them as their own, equating all such movements with Taiwan. Taiwan is a sovereign, democratic country that has never been governed by any regime in Beijing.

The G7 is an inter-governmental forum consisting of member states with the world’s largest developed economies: the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, Japan, France, and Italy. The group also includes the European Union (E.U.).

U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss prompted the Global Times remark by publishing a statement on Twitter reading in part, “our support is unwavering for the territorial integrity of Ukraine.”

The Chinese newspaper’s social media page compared Taiwan to Donetsk and demanded support for “eradicating” the Taiwanese government.

The Global Times is a daily tabloid owned by the People’s Daily, which is an official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk came after the Russian Security Council held a meeting on February 21 “focused on the current situation around Donbass in the context of the Russian lower parliament house’s resolution on the recognition of the Donbass republics,” according to Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency.

The Global Times referred to Taiwan on Tuesday when comparing China’s territorial disputes with those between Russia and neighboring Ukraine. Taiwan is a democratically-ruled, independent island nation located off China’s southeastern coast. Beijing considers Taiwan a “renegade” province of China. The Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly vowed to “reunify” Taiwan with China, most recently in November 2021.

“In a virtual meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, [Chinese leader] Xi [Jinping] stated China’s principled position on the Taiwan question,” Xinhua, China’s official state press agency, reported citing a November 16, 2021, conversation between the two heads of state.

“Calling achieving China’s complete reunification an aspiration shared by all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, Xi said, ‘We have patience and will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and efforts.'”

“That said, should the separatist forces for ‘Taiwan independence’ provoke us, force our hands or even cross the red line, we will be compelled to take resolute measures,” Xi added."
20220221,"Mateusz Morawiecki has called on the European Union to immediately impose sanctions on Russian Federation after the Russian president recognized the independence of two separatist republics on Ukrainian territory.""This is an act of aggression against Ukraine that must be met with an unequivocal response in the form of immediate sanctions,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki assessed, commenting on the fact that Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of Donetsk and Lugansk separatist republics in Ukraine.""The decision to recognize self-proclaimed 'republics' is the ultimate rejection of dialogue and a flagrant violation of international law,"" Morawiecki wrote on Twitter.""Sanctions are the only language Putin can understand. I call for an urgent meeting of the European Council on this issue"", the Polish prime minister added."
20220224,"President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the US will ban Russian energy imports as part of sanctions responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The embargo will include oil, liquefied natural gas and coal.

""That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports, and the American people will deal another blow to the Putin war machine,"" the president said in a press conference.

The British government also plans to phase out Russian refined oil, though not gasoline, according to Bloomberg.

Other European nations have been hesitant to make such a move: Germany, the biggest buyer of Russian crude, has rejected plans to ban energy imports, Reuters reported. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the country is speeding up plans to increase the use of alternative energy sources.

Russia is the world's largest exporter of crude and oil products, providing roughly 30% of the EU's crude supply and almost 40% of its gasoline. It's also the third-largest oil producer, behind the US and Saudi Arabia. Analysts have warned that shutting off that pipeline could have a seismic impact on energy markets and the global economy.

Here's what you need to know about the sanctions, including how the US ban on Russian oil will impact the economy and if other nations will follow sui.

How will the US ban on Russian oil affect consumers?

Russia is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of crude, but only provides about 8% of imports in the US, which gets most of its oil and petroleum imports from Canada, Mexico and Saudi Arabia.

In the short term, however, the US embargo will push stateside gas prices -- which, on average, hit $4.17 a gallon on Tuesday -- even higher.

Analysts at Capital Economics told CBS News a complete ban on Russian energy imports would push Brent crude, the global benchmark, up to $160 a barrel, well past the all-time high of $147, from 2008.

To counter some of that shortage, the US and its allies have released strategic reserves, which will ease prices at least for a few weeks.

To limit the impact of higher prices, the US and international partners are releasing oil from reserves. The Biden administration has also been negotiating Iran's reentry into a nuclear-control agreement -- which would bring Iranian oil back into play -- and restoring relations with Venezuela, which has been banned from selling oil to the US since 2018.

Europe has become more open to the idea of a ban in recent days, but only the UK has announced plans to ""phase out"" Russian energy products. To date, only the US and Canada have banned oil imports from Russia.

Russia is one of the world's largest exporters of crude oil, providing 20% of the EU's supply. Germany, its biggest client, has made it clear it has no intention of cutting off that source. Scholz, the chancellor, did did suspend certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, intended to transport natural gas from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Japan is also discussing an embargo on Russian oil. ""We still have several more options at hand for sanctions,"" Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, according to Kyoto News. ""We will carefully look at them and implement them.""

Some Western refineries are already refusing to buy Russian crude, with roughly 70% of the country's output ""struggling to find buyers,"" Energy Aspects told Financial Times.

How has the US sanctioned Russia so far?

On Feb. 24, Biden first announced ""devastating"" economic sanctions and export limits against Russia intended to ""impose a severe cost on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.""

They have included blocking the country's major banks from doing business in the US, issuing debt and equity restrictions on Russian-owned enterprises, freezing the assets of wealthy Putin allies and limiting imports of technology to the country.

On March 2, the White House imposed sanctions on nearly two dozen Russian defense companies that produce missiles, combat aircraft, drones, infantry vehicles and ""electronic warfare systems.""

The same day, the Biden administration took aim at Belarus, which borders both Russia and Ukraine, by limiting the export of military technology and other goods ""in response to its support of Putin's war of choice.""

Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has been accused of hosting Russian forces in his country as a staging ground for the invasion of Ukraine.

Last week, eight Putin allies and their families were singled out for sanctions, including billionaire brothers Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, industrialist Alisher Usmanov and Nikolai Tokarev, president of the Russian pipeline company Transneft. Visa restrictions were announced on an additional 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates.

They join members of Putin's inner circle already hit with travel bans, frozen assets and other penalties, including Russian Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu, oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin and Margarita Simonyan, the head of state television network RT.

The first round of European Union sanctions included blacklisting Russian politicians and halting European trade with Donetsk and Luhansk, breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine whose independence Moscow has recognized.

The EU has frozen Russian assets and blocked Russian banks' access to European financial markets. Along with the US, Australia, Canada and other countries, the European Commission worked to remove Russia's access to SWIFT, a critical global financial messaging system.

According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, EU sanctions have targeted the lion's share of the Russian banking sector and major state-owned companies and limited Russia's access to aerospace and computer technology.

She added that the sanctions are intended to not only hit the Russian economy but Putin's inner circle directly.

""We are also targeting Russian elites by curbing their deposits so that they cannot hide their money anymore in safe havens in Europe,"" she said. The EU has already levied personal sanctions against Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

The UK sanctioned at least 100 individuals and entities, including Putin and Lavrov, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week. On March 8, it was reported the UK would begin ""phasing out"" Russian energy products.

South Korea announced last week that it's banned exports of electronics, semiconductors, computers and communications technology, among other goods.

New Zealand, which already prohibits exports to the Russian military, announced new legislation on Monday that would allow it to freeze assets of major Russian companies and wealthy elites and keep New Zealand from being a haven for Russian oligarchs by stopping private jets and yachts owned by sanctioned elites from entering the country.

On Monday, word of a US ban on Russian oil spiked prices for West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, 4.5%, to highs of more than $124 a barrel.

Brent crude, the international standard, similarly jumped 5%, to nearly $129 a barrel.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that foreign bans on Russian oil ""would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market."" Speaking on state television on Monday, Novak predicted prices for crude would ""$300 per barrel, if not more.""

Those estimates are far out of line with other predictions, but banning Russian oil would definitely increase gas prices in Europe -- and, at least temporarily, in the US.

Russia has also threatened to close Nord Stream 1, a pipeline that provides some 55 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Europe. (Germany halted approvals for the larger Nord Stream 2 shortly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.)

In February, Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry warned of a ""finely tuned and painful"" response to sanctions imposed by the Biden administration -- retaliatory measures that would target ""sensitive"" US assets.

""There should be no doubt that sanctions will receive a strong response, not necessarily symmetrical, but finely tuned and painful to the American side,"" a ministry representative said in a statement, CNN reported.

Russia would be able to ""minimize the damage"" of US actions, they added. ""And even more so, sanctions pressure is not able to affect our determination to firmly defend our interests.""

While the ministry didn't specify what form that response would take, the US departments of Treasury and Homeland Security have sounded the alarm over potential cyberattacks on US banks, hospitals, government offices and power grids.

In addition, Russia is a major producer of platinum and the largest exporter of palladium, a metal used in automotive exhaust systems, fuel cells, mobile phones and even jewelry and dental fillings.

Rising prices of essential metals could lead to price increases for manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers."

20220225,"Maria Klimchak experiences waves of guilt because she’s in Chicago and safe while so many of her loved ones — including her 84-year-old mother — face peril and uncertainty in her homeland of Ukraine.

“I am crying all morning,” she said, her voice strained and tense. “But just to cry, it’s not helping. I feel guilty that I am not in Ukraine.”

Klimchak emigrated from Ukraine in 1993, a few years after her motherland gained independence from the former Soviet Union.

Three decades later, the nation’s hard-won sovereignty hangs in the balance.

News broke in Chicago late Wednesday that Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, spurring the largest conventional attack of a European state since World War II.

The next morning, Klimchak was at the Ukrainian National Museum in Chicago, where she works as a curator. She and other staff members clutched their cellphones, awaiting calls and text messages and emails from relatives overseas. The phone in the office was ringing nonstop, with supporters asking how they could help or where they could make donations to be sent to Ukraine.

Many callers of all races and ethnic backgrounds were requesting large blue and yellow Ukrainian flags, to be draped from the windows and balconies of Chicago-area homes in solidarity.

“It is a terrible time for everyone who lives around the world, not only for Ukrainians,” Klimchak said. “Even the moral support, it’s very important at this time.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin has essentially argued that Ukraine was always a part of Russia. Yet the exhibits and galleries that Klimchak curates tell a very different story, showcasing centuries of distinctive Ukrainian history, art and culture.

On display are a variety of kylym, intricately woven Ukrainian tapestries, and rushnyky, embroidered ritual cloths. The museum’s collection of more than 10,000 objects includes ancient Bibles and religious icons, as well as a replica of a Carpathian wooden church, built hundreds of years ago with a unique form of carpentry that used no nails or bolts.

Shelves of pysanky, ornately decorated Ukrainian Easter eggs, line a wall. Legend has it that the fate of humanity rests on the survival of these fragile eggs: An evil serpent would be unleashed to “overrun the world if the custom of egg decorating ends,” according to the museum’s website.

Shortly before missiles rained down on Ukraine, the nation’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had said that the “future of European security is being decided now, here in Ukraine.”

Russian forces on Friday were closing in on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, though Moscow agreed to engage in talks with the Ukrainian government. President Joe Biden had announced severe economic sanctions against Russia, and other nations have followed suit. The Pentagon is deploying some 7,000 more troops to Europe, not to fight in Ukraine but to defend and reassure NATO allies, Biden said.

“We stand up to bullies,” he said on Twitter. “We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.”

The museum collection also includes modern artifacts, commentary on present-day politics: Behind one glass display case is a small statue of a dragon with a face sculpted in the likeness of Putin.

Straddling the dragon is a Ukrainian soldier with a club behind his back, poised to strike.

“I hate this face, but I like this item,” said Klimchak, nodding in the direction of the statue. “Ukraine will never be back under the umbrella of the Soviet Union. They’ll never fall. They’ll never give up.”

Orysia Kourbatov, the museum’s administrator, was up all night watching the invasion unfold on the news, in disbelief.

“Is this really happening?” she keeps asking herself. “It doesn’t seem real. It doesn’t seem possible.”

Her husband and parents emigrated from eastern Ukraine, the scene of some of the worst fighting, where many of their relatives remain.

She was able to reach and speak with one cousin in Kyiv.

“At first, they said they were going to go west but there’s traffic lines,” Kourbatov said, tears welling in her eyes. “They’re all stuck, there’s nowhere to go. So, she said they’re staying put.”

Another cousin in eastern Ukraine emailed her a prayer, which translated into English reads in part: Bless us and turn away the hands of those who plot evil against humanity! We stand and are strengthened only by faith in Your Almighty and Power!

“Our people, everyone has been through so, so much,” Kourbatov said.

She recalled how her grandmother lost five children during the Holodomor, an intentional man-made famine engineered by Josef Stalin from 1932 to 1933, which killed millions of Ukrainians.

A museum exhibit documents this horrific period with photos and articles; the Soviet tactic was an attempt “to crush the Ukrainian people’s desire to create a separate destiny for their country,” according to a museum description.

While Kourbatov said she believes Ukraine has been supported by other European nations and the United States, she added that the international community needs to do more, including banning Russia from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication system, known as SWIFT, as well as charging Putin with war crimes.

Lydia Tkaczuk, president of the board of directors of the museum, said some of her relatives in Ukraine are fleeing or making preparations for their safety.

“One family member, she wouldn’t even talk to me,” Tkaczuk said. “She said ‘We’re packing up and leaving.’ But I don’t even know where they are going to. Other family members say they know of bomb shelters. So, if need be, they will go to the bomb shelter, but they are getting everything ready.”

Others, including several male relatives in Kyiv, intend to stay.

“Because they said they are going to be there, they are going to defend Ukraine,” she said.

Tkaczuk recalled her first trip to her ancestral homeland in the 1970s, while it was under Soviet rule. She recounts how a culture of fear and starkness permeated everyday life.

Her relatives didn’t tell any neighbors in their apartment building that she was from the United States; instead, they said she was visiting from Poland.

“When we talked about any family issues, we did it outside as we would walk,” Tkaczuk said. “We wouldn’t talk about it in the house. … They were afraid that somebody might be listening.”

The contrast was striking when she visited multiple times following Ukraine’s independence in 1991.

She described Kyiv as a cosmopolitan, Western city; its population is just a little larger than Chicago’s.

“It’s like Paris,” she said. “It’s a beautiful city.”

Her most recent trip was over the summer. She stayed in a hotel overlooking the Maidan, Kyiv’s Independence Square, the scene of a series of protests eight years ago that culminated in Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity in February 2014.

The civil unrest was sparked by then-President Viktor Yanukovych’s refusal to sign a European Union agreement, seen as caving to Russian pressure. The pro-Western demonstrations eventually toppled the government, and a Ukrainian court found Yanukovych guilty of treason in 2019.

More than 100 protesters — mainly civilians — who were killed during these demonstrations have been termed the “Heavenly Hundred.”

The museum hosted a candlelight vigil this month in their memory.

“This is how we unite with Ukraine,” Tkaczuk said.

Vasyl Stetsyuk didn’t sleep the night of the invasion.

“It is surreal to see that and realize what is happening,” he said.

The 34-year-old from west suburban Bartlett immigrated here a decade ago, but his mother, grandfather, cousins and many friends are still in Ukraine.

“Emotionally I’m just, like everybody, stressed out,” he said.

Concentrating on anything else proved difficult, so he took a day off work and spent the morning at a rally where he and other supporters flew Ukrainian flags over the Kennedy Expressway at Harlem Avenue. Later that day, he headed to a protest against the Russian invasion at Sts. Volodymyr and Olha Ukrainian Catholic Church.

“God save Ukraine!” the church posted on its Facebook page. “Lord, have mercy on us!”

Another demonstration is scheduled at the church Sunday afternoon.

Around midday Thursday, Stetsyuk visited the museum, which is across the street from the church, in the heart of the city’s Ukrainian Village neighborhood.

The museum was founded in 1952 by several displaced Ukrainian scholars, so its exhibits and archives would “reflect the lives of those forced by cruel circumstances to leave their homeland,” according to the museum website.

“I am not sure what’s going to happen in the next couple of days,” Stetsyuk said. “But I hope that slowly but surely we will defeat the aggressor and I hope it’s going to end at some point.”

He doesn’t believe the Ukrainian army will fall. He’s optimistic Ukraine will persevere and remain independent.

“I’m pretty sure they will fight until they can’t breathe,” he said. “At some point it will end. But I hope it doesn’t take a long time. And a lot of casualties.”"
20220225,"press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden White House has not ""ruled out diplomacy forever"" with Russia amid the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Psaki said the U.S. would not be completely icing out the Eastern European aggressor ""forever"" during the White House daily press briefing on Friday.

Psaki was also asked why President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin were not talking.

""I would say that a moment where a leader is beginning and in the middle of invading a sovereign country is not the moment where diplomacy feels appropriate,"" Psaki said.

""It does not mean we have not ruled out diplomacy forever. Obviously the president remains open to engaging on a leader-to-leader level, but this is not the moment.""

Psaki also said the U.S. was ""not in a business-as-usual moment"" amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Psaki also confirmed the U.S. will join the European Union in sanctioning Russian President personally over the invasion of Ukraine.

""In alignment with the decision by our European allies, the United States will join them in sanctioning President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov,"" Psaki said.

Psaki was pressed by reporters about whether the president made the decision to sanction Putin specifically after a press conference during which the president dodged multiple questions on the subject.

Biden’s press secretary responded that the personal sanctions on Putin have ""been on the table for some time"" but confirmed the final decision to do so was made ""over the last 24 hours.""

The sanctions also include a travel ban on Russia, but it is unclear if the ban would extend to Putin himself.

Psaki’s announcement comes as Russian forces bombard the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv in an attempted decapitating strike. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have condemned the attack on the sovereign nation."

• The U.S., European allies and Canada agreed to disconnect specific Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.
• SWIFT is an independent enterprise based in Belgium that serves as an internal messaging system between more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories.
• A country's removal from SWIFT means that key banks will be severed from much of the global financial system.

WASHINGTON — The U.S., European allies and Canada agreed Saturday to remove key Russian banks from the interbank messaging system, SWIFT, an extraordinary step that will sever the country from much of the global financial system.

""This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,"" the global powers wrote in a joint statement announcing the significant retaliatory measure.

Moscow's exclusion from SWIFT, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, means Russian banks won't be able to communicate securely with banks beyond its borders. Iran was removed from SWIFT in 2014 following developments to Tehran's nuclear program.

SWIFT is an independent enterprise based in Belgium that serves as an internal messaging system between more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories.

""Any decision to impose sanctions on countries or individual entities rests solely with the competent government bodies and applicable legislators,"" SWIFT said in a statement. ""Being incorporated under Belgian law, our obligation is to comply with related EU and Belgian regulation."" The group said it's seeking details on the entities the new effort will impact.

After the announcement, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal welcomed the measure, writing in a tweet, ""Appreciate your support and real help in this dark time. Ukrainian people will never forget this! Keep holding the line! We are on our land.""

In addition, the U.S. and its allies announced that they will impose restrictive measures aimed at preventing Russia's central bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that may undermine sanctions.

""This will show that Russia's supposed sanctions proofing of its economy is a myth. The $600 billion-plus war chest of Russia's foreign reserves is only powerful if Putin can use it,"" a senior administration official said on a call with reporters Saturday evening.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to share new details on Washington's position, said the impact of these sanctions will be felt immediately in Russia.

""You will immediately see a chilling effect fall over the Russian banking sector even beyond what's already occurred,"" the senior administration official said. ""We've now targeted all 10 of Russia's largest financial institutions, holding nearly 80% of the Russian banking sector's total assets,"" the person added.

When asked if the U.S. had any indication if China, the world's second-largest economy, would financially assist Russia amid punishing sanctions, the official said ""China's not coming to the rescue.""

""China is actually restricting some of its banks to provide credit to facilitate energy purchases from Russia, which suggests that much like has been the pattern for years and years, China has tended to respect the force of U.S. sanctions,"" the official said.

The leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada and the U.S. also plan to limit the sale of so-called golden passports. The official described them as a loophole that allows wealthy Russians connected to the Kremlin to become citizens in other countries and access certain financial systems.

""We will go after their yachts, their luxury apartments, their money and their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the west,"" the official added.

The announcement follows rounds of joint sanctions imposed against Russia for its unprovoked assault on Ukraine.

On Friday, the U.S. alongside the United Kingdom and the European Union announced sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In the weeks leading up to the invasion, the Biden administration threatened sanctions in the hopes of deterring Putin from further aggression against Ukraine."
20220227,"The European Union agreed to a 450 million euros ($500 million) lethal military aid package that may include fighter jets, according to EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.

Another 50 million euros will be allocated for non-lethal aid, according to Bloomberg.

“We’re going to supply arms…fighters,” Borrell said at a press conference in Brussels on Sunday. “We’re going to provide…even fighting jets. We’re not talking about just ammunitions, we’re providing the more important arms to go to war.”

Borrell added the EU has been in talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba about the type of jets the military needs.

According to Washington Post reporter Michael Birnbaum, the EU will be supplying “Russian-made” fighter jets to Ukraine from Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Poland. Birnbaum noted that the jets “need to be Russian-made, because that’s what Ukrainian fighter pilots can jump into and use from day 1.”

One source familiar with the negotiations told the Wall Street Journal that talks are still ongoing, and if fighter jets are provided, they would be sent directly from EU member states and not funded through the military package.

If approved by members, the lethal aid package would mark the first time the European Union agreed to finance and arrange the delivery of weapons and military equipment to a country at war.

“Another taboo has fallen,” Borrell said. “The taboo that the European Union was not providing arms in a war.”

20220227,"Leaders of the G7 on Sunday threatened fresh sanctions against Russia as the top US diplomat Antony Blinken said the group of wealthy nations was ""fully aligned"" against Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States warned in a joint statement that they would ""take further steps"" to add to the sanctions already announced if Russia did not cease its operation.

Russian military gains in Ukraine achieved through its ongoing campaign leading to ""any change of status"" such as the annexation of territory ""will not be recognised"", G7 foreign ministers said in a joint statement.

In a later statement, Blinken said the group has ""never been more fully aligned across the globe to defend and preserve the freedom and sovereignty of Ukraine and all states.""

G7 nations have already slapped harsh sanctions on Russia for invading neighbouring Ukraine.

The United States and EU have excluded some Russian banks from the international bank payments system SWIFT and personally targeted President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

On Sunday, Japan said it will also join in removing selected Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system, offer millions in humanitarian aid, and seek to identify and freeze assets belonging to Putin and other Russian officials.

Blinken said Tokyo's move demonstrates the G7's ""unity and resolve"" and will help to ""impose massive costs on Russia and thwart its ability to wage its war of choice on Ukraine.""

The European Union on Sunday announced plans to bar Russian planes from its airspace, after individual member states and Britain had earlier taken similar measures.

Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014, but the West has refused to recognise the change in territorial status.

Moscow also backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions from 2014 in a conflict that has claimed more than 14,000 lives, according to monitoring groups.

Putin's decision to recognise the breakaway republics as independent states this week sparked international condemnation as an assault on Ukraine's territorial integrity.

The move proved to be a prelude to Thursday's invasion."
20220228,"Russia’s business rupture with the West grew wider Monday as Shell, General Motors and others announced plans to end or freeze their dealings with the nation after its invasion of Ukraine.

The string of exits — planned or immediate, permanent or temporary — began to erase decades of business ties, with no clear reconciliation in sight.

Many of the announcements sprang from Western companies attempting to comply with U.S. and European sanctions on Russia, which have banned a range of trade in recent days. Other companies attributed their moves to disgust over the Kremlin’s attack on a sovereign neighbor.

Some of the relationships have survived big ups and downs over the past 30 years or more, but they “just broke in the last week,” said Nick Tsafos, an expert on energy and geopolitics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. “Companies are basically saying, ‘We don’t want to be part of this.’”

The corporate announcements were part of a broad economic splintering as banks raced to cut financial transactions with Russian counterparts to comply with Western sanctions and as a growing number of governments announced new steps to isolate Russia.

Britain added to a long list of economic punishments it had already adopted by banning Russian-owned ships from docking in U.K. ports. “Given Putin’s action in #Ukraine I’ve made clear these vessels are NOT welcome here,” tweeted Grant Shapps, Britain’s transport minister.

Even Switzerland suspended its centuries-old policy of neutrality and isolation to say it would join the European Union in closing its airspace to Russian flights and imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials.

“We are in an extraordinary situation where extraordinary measures could be decided,” the Swiss president and foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, told reporters Monday.

JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said banks were talking to the U.S. government to understand the new sanctions, which he said could have “unintended consequences.”

“War doesn’t always follow the path you want. Financial sanctions don’t always follow the path you want,” Dimon told Bloomberg TV on Monday. “People should be very thoughtful how they go about these things.”

“I’m an American patriot, and we’re going to do what the American government tells us to do,” he added.

The exodus has been starkest in the energy sector, with Shell on Monday becoming the third major oil and gas company to announce plans to leave Russia.

The London-headquartered company said it intends to “exit” stakes in joint ventures it shares with Russian gas giant Gazprom, estimating the value of those stakes at $3 billion.

They include Shell’s 27.5 percent interest in Sakhalin-2, a large oil and gas project on Sakhalin Island off Russia’s Pacific coast. Shell and other major oil companies have been pursuing large projects on the island since the 1990s.

Shell also plans to dump its stakes in Siberian energy projects and end its role providing financing for Nord Stream 2, a constructed but still inactive natural gas pipeline from Russia to Europe. Germany froze activation of the pipeline last week to punish Russia.

“We are shocked by the loss of life in Ukraine, which we deplore, resulting from a senseless act of military aggression which threatens European security,” Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said in an emailed statement. “We cannot — and we will not — stand by.”

“In discussion with governments around the world, we will also work through the detailed business implications, including the importance of secure energy supplies to Europe and other markets,” he added.

BP and Norway’s state-controlled oil company announced similar departures Sunday. It is not clear whether any of the companies will find buyers for their holdings or simply walk away from them.

GM, meanwhile, said it will suspend vehicle exports to Russia until further notice. The company sells about 3,000 vehicles in Russia a year, mostly via exports from the United States.

“Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine at this time,” GM said in a statement. “The loss of life is a tragedy and our overriding concern is for the safety of people in the region.”

GM spokesman George Svigos said the decision was “due to a number of external factors, including supply chain issues and other matters beyond the company’s control.”

The Danish shipping company Maersk said it might need to suspend shipping to and from Russia to comply with “ever-evolving sanctions” and airspace restrictions.

“For cargo already on the water, we will do our utmost to deliver it to its intended destination,” the company said, adding it would strive to protect perishable cargoes such as groceries and pharmaceuticals.

The German manufacturer Daimler Truck said it was immediately suspending all business activities in Russia until further notice, including its supply of civilian truck components to the Russian manufacturer Kamaz.

Daimler and Kamaz also have a joint venture making nonmilitary Mercedes-Benz trucks and cabins.

“We are deeply shocked by the military violence in Ukraine and very concerned about the threats to peace and stability in Europe,” Martin Daum, chairman of Daimler Truck, wrote in a message to employees Monday. “We clearly stand for peaceful global cooperation and categorically reject any form of military force.”"

The European Union has banned Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik from broadcasting in the bloc while banning “certain” Russian banks from the SWIFT bank messaging system, the EU’s rotating presidency said.

The moves, due to come into force on Wednesday after publication in the official journal of the EU, come as Brussels intensifies its sanctions regime on Moscow in response for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy has said in a phone call with Biden that it is important to stop “aggressor” Russia “as soon as possible”.

The call comes ahead of Biden’s State of the Union address.

Svitlana Zalishchuk, a foreign policy adviser to Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, told Al Jazeera that Ukrainians are fearful yet determined as fighting has increased across the country.

“We are scared that Putin is not going to stop,” Zalishchuk told Al Jazeera from Beregovo, a city in western Ukraine. She said approximately 100,000 people joined have so-called territorial defence units in recent days in response to Russia’s advance.

“For example, my brother, he is a businessman, he has nothing to do with [the] army but he took a gun and went to protect one of the towns at the entrance of Kyiv,” Zalishchuk said.

Miles-long Russian convoy appears stalled near Kyiv: US official

An enormous Russian military convoy is lumbering towards the capital, Kyiv, raising fears of an imminent uptick in fighting there.

A senior US defence official told reporters the convoy appeared to stall on Tuesday, however, due to a number of factors, including the Ukrainian resistance that the Russian troops have faced.

“We also believe that a part of the stall could be – and I emphasise the word ‘could’ – could be a result of their own self-determined sort of pause in operations – that they are possibly regrouping, rethinking, reevaluating,” the official said on condition of anonymity.

Tech giant Apple has announced a halt to all product sales in Russia. “We have paused all product sales in Russia. Last week, we stopped all exports into our sales channel in the country,” the company said in a statement.

The iPhone maker also announced Apple Pay and other services have been limited, while Russian state-owned media RT and Sputnik are no longer available for download outside Russia.

“We are deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence,” the statement said.

20220301,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As Russia’s war in Ukraine plays out for the world on social media, big tech platforms are moving to restrict Russian state media from using their platforms to spread propaganda and misinformation.

After the European Union’s president called for a ban on Russian state media, a wave of tech companies blocked the channels from their platforms.

Google announced Tuesday that it’s blocking the YouTube channels of those outlets in Europe “effective immediately” but acknowledged “it’ll take time for our systems to fully ramp up.” Russia’s RT and Sputnik accounts were also disabled in Europe on China’s TikTok, a video-sharing platform, a company spokesperson confirmed Tuesday. The actions followed Meta’s announcement that it would bar the state media from its platforms, Instagram and Facebook.

Tech companies have also offered more modest changes in other parts of the world so far: limiting the Kremlin’s reach, labeling more of this content so that people know it originated with the Russian government, and cutting Russian state organs off from whatever ad revenue they were previously making.

The changes are a careful balancing act intended to slow the Kremlin from pumping propaganda into social media feeds without angering Russian officials to the point that they yank their citizens’ access to platforms during a time of war, said Katie Harbath, a former public policy director for Facebook.

“They’re trying to walk this very fine line; they’re doing this dance,” said Harbath, who now serves as director of technology and democracy at the International Republican Institute. “We want to stand up to Russia, but we also don’t want to get shut down in the country. How far can we push this?”

Banning RT and Sputnik won’t shut off the well of disinformation around the war in Ukraine that’s flowing into social media feeds from everyday users, pundits or the Kremlin’s vast network of Facebook pages, trolls and reporters.

But unlike the EU, the U.S. government has not cut off one of the most obvious supplies of wartime propaganda by sanctioning Russian state media or calling on tech companies to ban it, leaving the American-owned tech companies to wrestle with it on their own.

The results have been mixed.

RT and other Russian-state media accounts are still active on Facebook in the U.S. Twitter announced Monday that after seeing more than 45,000 tweets daily from users sharing Russian state-affiliated media links in recent days, it will add labels to content from the Kremlin’s websites. The company also said it would not recommend or direct users to Russian-affiliated websites in its search function.

Over the weekend, the Menlo Park, California-based company announced it was banning ads from Russian state media and had removed a network of 40 fake accounts, pages and groups that published pro-Russian talking points. The network used fictitious persons posing as journalists and experts, but didn’t have much of an audience.

Meanwhile, Microsoft announced it wouldn’t display content or ads from RT and Sputnik, or include RT’s apps in its app store. And Google’s YouTube restricted Russian-state media from monetizing the site through ads, although the outlets are still uploading videos every few minutes on the site.

On TikTok, a Chinese platform popular in the U.S. for short, funny videos, state-affiliated media is not labeled as such. And pro-Russian propaganda and misinformation around the war has flourished on its site.

One recent video posted to RT’s TikTok channel, which is still active in the U.S., features a clip of Steve Bannon, a former top adviser to ex-President Donald Trump who now hosts a podcast with a penchant for misinformation and conspiracy theories.

“Ukraine isn’t even a country. It’s kind of a concept,” Bannon said in the clip, echoing a claim by Russian President Vladimir Putin. “So when we talk about sovereignty and self-determination it’s just a corrupt area where the Clintons have turned into a colony where they can steal money.”

Already, Facebook’s efforts to limit Russian state media’s reach have drawn ire from Russia. Last week, Meta officials said they had rebuffed Russia’s request to stop fact-checking or labeling posts made by Russian state media. Kremlin officials responded by restricting access to Facebook.

The company has also denied requests from Ukrainian officials who have asked Meta to remove access to its platforms in Russia. That would prevent everyday Russians from using the platforms to learn about the war, voice their views or organize protests, according to Nick Clegg, recently named the company’s vice president of global affairs

“We believe turning off our services would silence important expression at a crucial time,” Clegg wrote on Twitter Sunday.

More aggressive labeling of state media and moves to de-emphasize their content online might help reduce the spread of harmful material without cutting off a key information source, said Alexandra Givens, CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington non-profit.

“These platforms are a way for dissidents to organize and push back,” Givens said. “The clearest indication of that is the regime has been trying to shut down access to Facebook and Twitter.”

Russia has spent years creating its sprawling propaganda apparatus, which boasts dozens of sites that target millions of people in different languages. That preparation is making it hard for any tech company to mount a rapid response, said Graham Shellenberger at Miburo Solutions, a firm that tracks misinformation and influence campaigns.

“This is a system that has been built over 10 years, especially when it comes to Ukraine,” Shellenberger said. “They’ve created the channels, they’ve created the messengers. And all the sudden now, we’re starting to take action against it.”

Redfish, a Facebook page that is labeled as Russian-state controlled media, has built up a mostly U.S. and liberal-leaning audience of more than 800,000 followers over the years.

The page has in recent days posted anti-U.S. sentiment and sought to downplay Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a “military operation” and dedicating multiple posts to highlighting anti-war protests across Russia.

One Facebook post also used a picture of a map to highlight airstrikes in other parts of the world.

“Don’t let the mainstream media’s Eurocentrism dictate your moral support for victims of war,” the post read.

Last week, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia sent letters to Google, Meta, Reddit, Telegram, TikTok and Twitter urging them to curb such Russian influence campaigns on their websites.

“In addition to Russia’s established use of influence operations as a tool of strategic influence, information warfare constitutes an integral part of Russian military doctrine,” Warner wrote.

20220304,"On 26 February 2022, the European Union, UK, Canada and the USA published a Joint Statement on further restrictive measures in light of Russian’s invasion of Ukraine. These nations committed to ensuring “selected Russian banks” are removed from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messaging system.

SWIFT is a Belgian-based financial messaging services cooperative which supports 11,000 banking and securities organizations, market infrastructures and corporate customers in more than 200 countries. As a result of the ban, these selected Russian banks will be unable to initiate payment instructions in eligible payment systems nor receive inbound payments in those same systems.

Companies owed money by Russia would have to find alternative ways to get paid. Russian banks may route payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has its own payments system called the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System. Russia has a SWIFT alternative known as the SPFS which may also be used as may cryptoasset payments platforms.

The selected Russian banks may seek to use alternatives to SWIFT but all such alternatives have critical interoperability, cost, security and speed constraints.

On 2 March 2022, the European Union published a selected list of Russian banks that are subject to the SWIFT ban in the official journal of the European Union.1

These banks are: VTB Bank (being Russia’s second largest bank), Vnesheconombank (VEB), Rossiya Bank, Sovcombank, Bank Otkritie, Novikombank and Promsvyazbank.

The ban will take effect as of 12 March 2022. This 10 day delay is designed to give SWIFT and other operators a brief transition period to implement the measure.

The official journal also applies the measure to “any legal person, entity or body, established in Russia whose proprietary rights are directly or indirectly owned for more than 50 %” by these Russian banks.

This list does not name Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender by assets, nor Gazprombank, which is heavily involved in its energy sector. According to the EU press release, the European Commission “is prepared to add further Russian banks [to the list] at short notice”.

Alexei Kudrin, Russia's former finance minister, suggested all Russian financial institutions being cut off from SWIFT could shrink Russia's economy by 5%.

SWIFT acts as the carrier of messages containing payment instructions between financial institutions involved a transaction.

The SWIFT organisation itself does not manage accounts for institutions, holds no institution funds and does not perform clearing or settlement functions. After a payment has been initiated using a SWIFT message, it must be settled through a payment system such as the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System (TARGET2).

SWIFT sends more than 40 million messages a day – 1% of which involve Russian payments.

SWIFT is jointly owned by 2,000 banks and financial institutions. SWIFT's Board of Directors is comprised of 25 independent Directors appointed by its shareholders. According to Article 17 of the SWIFT By-laws, nations with more member institutions of SWIFT have additional rights to appoint directors.

SWIFT is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in partnership with major central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.

On 1 March 2022, SWIFT published a press release noting the Joint Statement and stating that SWIFT is engaging with these authorities to understand which entities will be subject to these new measures. SWIFT states that it will disconnect them once it has received a legal instruction to do so.

How are members removed from SWIFT?

Article 16(c) of the SWIFT By-laws state that:

c. The Board of Directors may suspend or expel a Shareholder from the Company if it establishes in its opinion that such Shareholder: –– does not observe the By-laws of the Company and/or the Corporate Rules or any undertaking towards the Company; –– makes any arrangement or composition with or concerning its creditors; –– is subject to regulations impacting its shareholding in the Company; –– commits an act of negligence which may be prejudicial to the interest of the Company provided that the Board of Directors informs the Shareholder in writing of the reasons underlying its decision and that the relevant mandatory provisions under Belgian law are complied with.

Part 3 of the SWIFT Corporate Rules also provides that the Board of Directors should be provided a written report from SWIFT management for the termination of an existing shareholder. Termination (expulsion) is subject to section 7.3 on dispute resolution in the SWIFT Corporate Rules.

We expect the Board of Directors will expel the selected Russian banks based on the European Commission Decisions using the ground that these selected Russian banks are subject to regulations impacting their shareholding in the Company (SWIFT).

All relations between SWIFT and each member, as well as the SWIFT by-laws and SWIFT Corporate Rules are governed by the laws of Belgium.

As part of the Crimea related sanctions of 2014, Russia was threatened with expulsion from SWIFT. Western countries did not proceed with this action but this did prompt Russia to begin the development of its own cross-border transfer system, SPFS.

At the end of 2020, there are 23 foreign banks connected to the SPFS from Armenia, Belarus, Germany, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Switzerland. There are also plans to link SPFS to payment systems in China, India and Iran. These plans may be accelerated to the extent that a significant number of Russian banks are banned from SWIFT.

SPFS is not seen as a viable alternative to SWIFT given that the system currently only works within Russia and is subject to high transaction costs.

Russian banks may choose to deal directly with non-Russian banks in order to process payments. This would likely add delays and additional costs to the payments process which may be passed on to the payer/payee.

It may also lead to payments business transferring from Russian banks subject to sanctions to Russian banks not subject to sanctions but subject to SWIFT expulsion.

The Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) is a payment system which offers clearing and settlement services for its participants in cross-border RMB payments. It is a significant payment infrastructure in China.

Last week in advocating for Russia not to be banned from SWIFT, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said ""that the suspension of SWIFT would affect the Russian Federation less than the European Union,"" and argued that Russia could use its ""own payment system, and secondly, it would immediately switch to Chinese payment systems.""

While the identity of participants is not in the public domain, according to the CIPS Participants Announcement No 73, in January 2022 CIPS has 75 direct participants and 1205 indirect participants. Russian banks likely will be both direct and indirect participants of CIPS.

Banning Russian banks from SWIFT may result in Russian payment being processed in decentralised networks such as Bitcoin.

According to Banco Santander, Russia’s import/export flows total around USD570 billion annually, a volume that could be accommodated on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin processes USD20 billion in on-chain transactions per day, or more than USD7 trillion per year.

Until the ban is put in place on 12 March 2022 , it is difficult to assess the breadth of the impact of the SWIFT ban.

For counterparties to contractual relations, the removal of Russian institutions from SWIFT due to European Commission Decisions may provide grounds for recission due to illegality.

DLA Piper expect such ground to be relied upon, including as an event of default, in a variety of commercial and financial arrangements.

There remains considerable uncertainty as to the status of in-flight transactions at the time that SWIFT access is banned. These payments will be subject to their respective payment systems’ contingency, liquidity management and resolution mechanisms."
20220308,"Bahrain Center for Strategic, International and Energy Studies (Derasat) hosted a discussion panel titled ‘EU-Bahrain: A Multi-Dimensional Partnership’ to discuss further enhancing relations between Bahrain and the European Union.

The event coincided with the first anniversary of the signing of the Cooperation Arrangement between Bahrain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the European External Action Service in 2021 that provides an institutional framework for political dialogue and cooperation in areas of trade, research and innovation, clean energy and renewables.

Panellists included EU Ambassador to KSA, Bahrain and Oman Patrick Simonnet, and Chief of European Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ambassador Ahmed Al Qarainees.

Other panellists were Managing Director of Eni in Bahrain and Lebanon, Deputy Managing Director and Head of Geoscience in Eni UAE Dr Andrea Cozzi, and Executive Director of the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Bahrain (FCCIB) Rim Jalali.

“The Kingdom of Bahrain views the European Union as a distinguished regional organization and a model for integration and complementarity; one that the Kingdom ensures it develops its relations with bilaterally or holistically,"" Derasat Executive Director Dr Hamad Ebrahim Al Abdullah said,

He pointed to estimates that indicated a commercial exchange worth 2.5 billion Euros between Bahrain and the EU until the end of 2021, in addition to the numerous European companies operating in Bahrain, and European expertise found in the Kingdom’s public and private sectors.

Al Abdullah referred to the increased frequency of exchanged visits between both sides in the past few years, ensuring how keen they are on developing their relations based on the largely entwined interests, as confirmed by regional challenges, especially the COVID pandemic.

Energy security and climate change are additional challenges, and all of them require an extended mutual dialogue to coordinate the efforts in countering these challenges, he said.

Simonnet said that cooperation with Bahrain is multi-dimensional given its importance as an EU partner.

Signing the 2021 Cooperation Agreement was a significant step in developing multi-sector relations, including economic and commercial diversification, research and innovation, human rights, clean energy, and renewable energy sources – a field in which the EU is at the global forefront, the ambassador said.

He pointed to the EU’s work on enhancing individual relations through the exchange of students and researchers.

Al-Qarainees stressed the need for strengthened bilateral relations with the EU in all areas and described them relations as rapidly growing in economic, educational, environmental, and parliamentary aspects, thanks to the focus by the Kingdom’s wise leadership on cooperating with the EU in constructive aspects.

He said that such meetings are crucial in setting the frameworks for cooperation, based on previous achievements to increase Bahrain-EU partnerships."

Media literacy activity: Ways to discuss news coverage of war and violence

As teachers, we know you are constantly reflecting on how you will teach critical issues like the war in Ukraine. It may be helpful to share some of that reflection with your students in the questions below. They will appreciate your frankness.

Let your students know that PBS NewsHour Classroom creates lessons on difficult and even scary news events, like the war in Ukraine. According to PBS NewsHour Classroom’s mission statement, they have the responsibility using the standards and resources of the PBS NewsHour to provide teachers and students with quality educational resources based on current issues and events and offer an outlet for young people to speak out on issues important to them.
• Should PBS NewsHour Classroom include graphic footage of the war in Ukraine in their lessons? Why or why not? Are there any stipulations you’d put on this?
• Judy Woodruff includes a warning that the images in the story are graphic. Do you think this is helpful? Should more news outlets give similar warnings?
• Are there times you show only part of the video to your class, making sure to leave out the more graphic images? What do your students think of this decision? Do you explain your reasoning?

Find out what students already know – follow their lead

You’ll have to use your best judgement here, knowing some students will want to discuss events in Ukraine and other types of violence conflict more than others. But it’s always amazing how much students already know about current events and have seen many of the images adults have seen. We all need a thoughtful place to process and discuss difficult topics. The video featured in this lesson showed the victims of war in Ukraine: people walking past bombed out buildings where they live, a pregnant women being rushed away from a maternity ward after Russia bombed it and a photocopy of shrapnel in a boy’s chest.
• Ask your students if they’ve seen these images or similar images before class–and where–on their phones on the way to school? With friends? Watching television/online news programs with their families?
• Do students think discussions about the war in Ukraine should occur in school?
• Do they think images of the realities of war should be shared and discussed in class in a responsible, sensitive and thoughtful way? Do you allow students who don’t wish to view the video a chance to work on something else?

Media literacy using See, Think, Wonder with non-graphic news stories about war

Media literacy can provide an excellent alternative avenue to understanding difficult issues in the news or from history. Analyzing and evaluating news coverage gives students a chance to talk about the issues without thinking they have to give their own personal opinion on the matter. Find an excerpt from a few different news organizations on the same topic — one that does not include images or descriptions of war but maybe focuses more on policy decisions. You may want to use the story about President Joe Biden banning Russian oil in the U.S. Here’s NewsHour’s story on it. Now find this story on two other news organization’s websites. This is a good place to use See, Think, Wonder comparing and contrasting the three stories.

You will find some students want to share their opinions right off the bat, and in fact, this is their favorite part of class, but many other students don’t want to share their personal thoughts for all sorts of reasons. This is when media literacy questions like whose voices were included in the story and whose voices were left out are useful. Study the headlines and the sub-headlines using See, Think, Wonder.

How the media has covered Ukraine compared to other conflicts

You may wish to check out this podcast: Podcast: Media bias, and refugees ‘like us’ or read the article In Ukraine reporting, Western press reveals grim bias toward ‘people like us’ both by the Los Angeles Times. The description of the podcast episode reads: “The European Union is doing everything possible to welcome Ukrainian refugees. And people around the world have donated money and supplies to help. But this open-arms response has people in similar situations wondering: Why so much goodwill toward Ukrainians, and not us? Today, we talk about the media’s role in deciding who is the “right” type of refugee — and how that helps or hinders displaced people around the world.”
• Ask your students, who they think the “not us” is? Why are African, Middle Eastern and Indian refugees from Ukraine facing discrimination at the Ukraine-Poland border? What should be done about the difference in treatment white Ukrainians and non-white refugees are experiencing?

You may also want to check out Yousef Munayyer’s piece in The Nation: On Watching Ukraine Through Palestinian Eyes: The rightful outpouring of support for Ukraine teaches us that the West can condemn occupation when it wants to.

And conduct some research as to why Vogue magazine removed the word “Palestine” from their Instagram post quoting supermodel Gigi Hadid’s pledge on Instagram to donate her Paris Fashion Week’s earnings to Ukraine and Palestine. Vogue issued a correction here after facing backlash. This Al Jazeera article mentions the double standard seen in several media organization’s coverage of Ukraine — including Al Jazeera English.

Ask students: What does criticism of the media’s coverage of Ukraine compared to other atrocities say to you about how different people perceive injustice? If there are different perceptions of what makes an event just or unjust, how do you end up solving the conflict?

It’s understandable to feel upset – that includes you, too

Explain to your students that It is understandable to feel upset because of events in Ukraine and other images of conflict you may see on the news. Discuss people with whom students can talk about their feelings inside school and outside school. If they are not sure, mention the role of the school counselor and let them know they can speak to you after class if they don’t want to comment out loud. If you yourself are feeling upset, be sure to talk with a colleague or friend."

BNP Paribas has also cut off its Russia-based workforce from its internal computer systems as it seeks to bolster its defenses against any potential cyberattack, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The French lender is believed to be the first major bank to have excluded staff in Moscow from its IT networks. Citigroup Inc said on Wednesday it is operating its Russian consumer business on a more limited basis following the country’s invasion of Ukraine, while sticking with its previous plans to divest the franchise. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, said on Wednesday its exposure to financial markets in Russia and Ukraine was very limited. Deutsche Bank has reduced its Russian exposure and local footprint significantly since 2014, with further reductions in the past two weeks, the bank added.

The European Union agreed new sanctions against Russia and its ally Belarus on Wednesday that blacklist 14 more oligarchs and freeze relations with Belarus’ central bank and three top lenders there. Financial information provider S&P Global added to the growing list of companies to suspend commercial operations in Russia, a day after Britain’s London Stock Exchange Group stopped some services in the country. Italy’s second-biggest bank, UniCredit, said late on Tuesday that a full write-off of its Russian business would cost it around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion). BNP Paribas said it had a total exposure of around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to Russia and Ukraine, which it said was relatively limited.

Shares in Europe’s major financial firms have fallen sharply since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as investors took fright at some institutions’ exposure to Russia and braced for a potential broader economic slowdown. UniCredit said a worst-case scenario would knock 2 percentage points off its capital ratio, but nonetheless stuck with its dividends and share buyback plans. Shares in UniCredit rebounded 11.68% and BNP Paribas 9.95%, with the wider STOXX index of European banks up 7.49% on the day , staging a partial rebound after recent falls. The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day percentage gain since June 5, 2020. Analysts suggested the rebound could be a temporary relief rally. “The mood in the markets has swung around and stocks are enjoying a major rally. The fact that Western governments seem to be carrying out an economic war against Russia, rather than military conflict, has helped the overall sentiment,” wrote David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital.

Europe’s struggling banks entered 2022 on a wave of optimism not seen in more than a decade, but investors and analysts have warned the Ukraine crisis may have knocked that flat. Credit Suisse economists slashed their forecast for European growth on Wednesday and now expect the region to expand just 1% this year as the Ukraine crisis turbocharges commodities prices and disrupts supply chains. Among European banks, Austria’s Raiffeisen Bank International and France’s Societe Generale have the largest Russian exposure. S&P Global joined rival credit rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch in suspending commercial operations in Russia. The move comes as the London Stock Exchange Group suspended access in Russia to products containing news and commentary, as well as all new sales of products and services. LSEG said data products will continue to be accessible by currently serviced customers."
20220316,
20220321,"As the dreadful weeks of combat have rolled on, often in full view on the world’s television screens, smartphones and laptops, the death toll and destruction has continued to rise in Ukraine. To the astonishment of many observers, Russian soldiers have been dying in numbers entirely unexpected by both their commanders and Russia’s president.

Great numbers of Russian heavy armour have also been destroyed while stalled in convoys on Ukraine’s roads along the invasion routes. This debacle has shattered some myths about Russian military strategic and tactical genius — and it has also demonstrated real weaknesses in Russian logistical capabilities, as well as command and control systems.

Now largely static on most of the battlefronts, the Russian military has increasingly shifted to a Plan B, carrying out a devastating air war, using cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, and some not-so-smart bombs that have largely been hitting civilian targets such as hospitals, schools, shopping malls, theatres used as air-raid shelters, and multistorey apartment buildings.

Beyond the devastation and death, this kind of warfare almost inevitably will continue to harden the resolve of Ukrainians to resist the invasion and it will destroy any remaining fraternal feelings between the two populations, despite a densely intertwined history.

Nevertheless, regardless of the rising civilian death toll and the growing destruction of infrastructure across the country, the Ukrainian military appears to have learnt how to carry on the fight with a degree of canny sophistication against superior forces.

This has forced Russian commanders to confront a nasty Hobson’s choice of either going forward with punishing ground fighting in cities that will bring additional heavy casualties or to continue with its unrestrained pummelling of civilians. The latter has been designed to break the will of the government and its people through its apparently random rain of death and destruction falling on to Ukraine’s cities and towns. But that has not happened yet.

The current situation also is giving rise to a growing unease inside Russia by some (including a growing flow out of Russia by its younger professional class) over these sacrifices being made for an inexplicable cause, as well as in response to the growing clampdowns on the rather limited space left for free expression in Russia. (This has been in contrast to the nearly endless agitprop being pumped out domestically and a run of presidential speeches arguing that the Russian military has been carrying out a sacred duty in preventing a genocide of ethnic Russians or in fighting to extirpate a neo-Nazi, thuggish, drug-dealing governmental cabal, acting at the command of a mendacious West.)

Of course, there have also been the increasing economic disruptions and financial pain now reaching ordinary Russians, flowing from the growing roster of sanctions. This is beyond the pain being dished out to Russian oligarchs and other privileged individuals who now can no longer sail their yachts with impunity or live in guilty splendour as they enjoy the pleasures of Mediterranean resorts. (Those latter criticisms are a paraphrase of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s own angry words as he lashed out in evident frustration, not this writer’s. They seem to be the mark of an increasingly angry, frustrated man, one whose self-deluding plans have now gone seriously awry.)

Taken together, Russia’s military commanders (if not — yet — the nation’s apex predator) increasingly seem to be coming to the harsh realisation that there is no easy pathway to what could plausibly be termed an unambiguous victory in Ukraine. Significant numbers of reinforcements are already being brought in from distant duty stations across the nation and beyond, and mercenary forces are reported to have been recruited for service from Syria and Chechnya as well.

Given the increasing military aid flooding into Ukraine from the West, Russian battlefield losses in men and machines may begin to rise more rapidly. It is even conceivable some troops might start refusing to carry out orders as they will have judged the risk of their dying in this murky cause might rise to a near certainty in exchange for unknowable gains.

Of course, on the Ukrainian side, things have been reaching increasingly drastic circumstances as well. While anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons are becoming increasingly plentiful, and they are largely being used to great effect, civilian morale may be moving closer to an inflection point as the deaths and destruction continue to rise around them.

Shortages of food, fuel, potable water, shelter and medical care are hitting the population hard in and around many urban centres. With about 10 million frightened people now on the move to safer spaces at home or in neighbouring nations as permanent or temporary refugees, the growing disruptions are making effective government beyond military action increasingly difficult to achieve. This is the case even if the country’s military and its citizen militias have continued — so far, at least — to hold off Russian occupation of the country’s main cities of Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odesa, and Lviv.

Taken together, the rising tide of human suffering and the staggering costs may just possibly be creating a potential opening window for a way out of this catastrophe. What might tip the scales one way could be unsustainable losses by the Russian military in the field, beyond the levels deemed reasonable for the achievement of Vladimir Putin’s dubious policy objectives. Or, perhaps the opprobrium that would come after the destruction of irreplaceable historic or artistic sites and items in Kyiv and the consequent international uproar beyond what it is already in place might tip those same scales as well.

Of course, if Ukraine were to capitulate formally in the face of an eventual overwhelming Russian military onslaught, despite those forces’ losses in the field, the challenge for the Russians would then become how they could manage to rule and police a vast, restive nation. This would be a territory filled with military irregulars engaged in guerrilla fighting, together with a population filled with resentments about Russia’s forced, deadly intrusion into their lives.

Accordingly, the pressure on the two parties to move through that small window towards a negotiated end to the conflict may feed on growing fatigue and weariness of the combatants. And, one has already heard statements from President Zelensky that he is prepared to sit down with his counterpart, even if the restated Russian demands from Putin from before the fighting began, are about the same as before the tanks began to roll.

Nevertheless, these cumulative pressures to move towards some kind of negotiation will grow. This will be true as the combat takes on increasingly horrific aspects, with greater casualties and general human suffering, and perhaps most importantly in thoughts shared among the small circle of Putin’s senior advisers as they do their cost/benefit sums regarding staying on in this fight. This would still be true even if the Russians “win” on the battlefield.

Regardless, more clear-headed Russian leaders will realise they will be forced to maintain a continuing military engagement in Ukraine for years to come. That eventuality could easily become a much closer to home, much costlier mission than even was the case in their shellacking in Afghanistan in 1989. (That defeat, and the toll of some 15,000 battlefield deaths, was a contributing factor to the collapse of the Soviet Union.)

At this point, the role of potential intermediaries and mediators becomes that much more important. Several nations’ leaders have already been edging their way forward to position themselves for that task. So far at least, Turkey’s president, Recep Erdoğan, and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett have been the most vocal in pressing the case for their availability for this task, although neither may have the geopolitical heft needed for such a role on their own.

But if one adds China’s Xi Jinping into the mix (with the potential benefits that could flow from this), one might conceivably have enough gravitas among mediators, albeit a meeting with a rather awkward seating chart, especially if one adds the UN secretary-general to the mix. By contrast, figuring out where to hold such negotiations would be child’s play. The Israelis have mentioned that holding it in Jerusalem would be appropriate, but the Swiss, among others, have much experience in such things, and tradition matters too.

So, assume negotiations actually will take place amid this nasty, brutal stalemate and a growing exhaustion on the part of the combatants. The first order of business would be to achieve a (grudging) agreement for a general ceasefire in place. Here is where the UN’s responsibility of policing such a declaration must be exercised, even if it requires a large number of expensive peace monitors, drawing upon troops designated by member states, similar to the way such tasks have occurred in the Sinai and elsewhere.

That ceasefire, however, would say little or nothing about the circumstances of those millions of displaced people, the devastation to the countryside, or the costs incurred by individuals as a result of the fighting. But, beyond an eventual political settlement, all of these issues will need their space and attention on the agenda.

On the table for the political and security agenda would be the following: the final resolution of the status of the Donbas territories; the final resolution of the internationally recognised status of the Crimean Peninsula; the future relationship, if any, between Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato); the future possibilities of membership in the European Union, once peace is restored; the nature and size of the Ukrainian military; and an overall determination of Ukraine’s status as a “Finlandised” state. (An irony there, of course, is that Finland is increasingly coordinating its defence posture with Nato, in response to Russian military actions

So, let us assume Ukraine formally agrees to relinquish any dream of joining Nato, but it still reserves the right as a sovereign nation to negotiate its way to membership in the EU. This would clearly be to gain easy access to its large, rich market, those EU support funds dedicated to poorer member states, a real connection to the European Central Bank, and a real chance to anchor itself firmly with the West, at least in economic terms. (Agricultural policy questions will likely complicate negotiations with the EU.)

In exchange, a logical negotiating posture for Ukraine would be to insist the official final status of Crimea and the Donbas regions would be dependent on well-policed referenda monitored by the UN and that Ukraine would bind itself to accepting the results. (There would naturally be all manner of issues over who is eligible to vote, but those will have to be the responsibility of whatever international body supervises the voting.)

Finally, regarding its defence establishment, Ukraine would agree it is willing to downsize its military commensurate with its status as a neutral nation like Austria or Switzerland, but only in exchange for formal acceptance of the absolute territorial integrity of the state by Russia and Russia’s willingness to abide by the results of the two referenda. Those are the easy issues.

Then there are the truly hard questions. The repatriation of the several million refugees who have fled to other nations or internally within Ukraine and who hope to return to their homes (assuming the buildings are still standing) must be given urgent attention to minimise the immediate human cost arising from the fighting.

But more important still, the human cost arising from the hostilities and the destruction of infrastructure, homes and other property must be paid for by those who caused it. And that, of course, will mean reparations. And reparations inevitably mean someone must pay them. Here the logical — indeed, the only — candidate must be Russia, given the massive evidence of its actions as well as the recent International Court of Justice finding that Russia is the proximate cause of all the death and destruction.

To some, the concept of reparations might seem like an abstract, distant fantasy, but the concept has deep historical roots. The first documented reparations came out of the Punic Wars when the Roman Republic demanded reparations from Carthage as the price of peace.

In more recent times, reparations payments have been an integral part of numerous peace treaties. At the end of the Franco-Prussian War, the French, having lost decisively after having initially forced the issue, were saddled with a massive payment to Prussia that was only achieved through a major national effort. In one of the interminable Balkan Wars, following a defeat in 1897, Greece needed to pay a reparations bill to the rickety Ottoman Empire. The Chinese, meanwhile, paid a settlement to Japan to achieve the end of the Sino-Japanese War of 1895. And as is well known, part of the peace treaty for World War 1 was a massive reparations bill handed to Germany after its defeat.

Following the end of World War 2, German reparations were largely paid in kind through the disassembly of manufacturing equipment, most of which was sent eastward to compensate the Soviet Union for the destruction of its capital equipment stock. Other nations that had participated as Axis partners — Italy, Hungary, Romania and Finland — also made reparations payments in the final settlement of the war.

Following World War 2, Japan also was required to pay reparations to China, Korea and other states. Of course, the German state also eventually paid reparations to individual survivors of the concentration and extermination camps, as well as some funds to the new Israeli nation.

More recently, Iraq was required to make restitution to Kuwait following Iraq’s defeat in the first Gulf War. The bulk of those payments went to individuals, rather than to a government. The UN Compensation Commission (the war had been fought effectively under UN auspices) noted that its prioritisation of claims by “natural people”, ahead of claims by governments and entities or corporations (legal persons), “marked a significant step in the evolution of international claims practice”. Funds for these payments were supposed to come from a 30% share of Iraq’s oil revenues from the “oil for food” programme.

In the current case and the putative future settlement, where would the funds to provide reparations and compensation come from? Fortunately, economist Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, in just the past several days, has come forward with a plan to approach that question in his article, first written for and then carried on the Brookings Institution website, Russia can be made to pay for Ukraine damage now , Litan wrote, “Billions of people around the world are watching helplessly as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerates into its third week, continuing to kill more innocent people every day while destroying infrastructure throughout the country and forcing millions of refugees into neighbouring European countries.

“There is one positive step that the U.S. and like-minded countries should begin developing immediately to ensure that Russia at least is held responsible for the cost of humanitarian assistance, reparations, and eventual reconstruction: Tap Russian foreign exchange reserves that are held in central banks outside the country and that have been frozen by their governments.”

Litan cited Russian central bank figures and legal reasoning to the effect that, as of 2021, “Russia’s foreign currency reserves totalled $585 billion, though not all of this would be accessible to pay for damages. That’s because Russia holds a good portion of the total in gold at home (22%), a substantial amount of renminbi in China (14%), and some in international institutions (5%). Subtracting these amounts leaves about $350 billion in ‘available reserves’ for distribution—mostly held by France (12%), Germany (10%), Japan (10%) and the U.S. (7%), with the rest scattered among many other countries.

“In the past, reparations have been paid after hostilities ended by the aggressor country…. Now, the fact that many countries already have control over Russia’s holdings of foreign currency means that, in effect, reparations for the Ukrainian invasion have been pre-funded by Russia itself. This is an admittedly unique circumstance, but there is a basis in international law for enabling nations that hold these reserves to commit them to pay for damages.

“Russia has committed on a massive scale what under U.S. law is considered an ‘intentional tort’: unprovoked violence, which requires at a minimum that the aggressor pay damages for human suffering, deaths, and property losses. In December 2005 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution affirming a variation of intentional tort doctrine by providing a right to reparations to victims of human rights abuses under international law.” That case can only have been made stronger as a result of the recently issued International Court of Justice decision.

While it is extremely unlikely the UN would be in a position to administer such a fund given those Security Council vetoes held by Russia and China, Litan argues, “Nonetheless, a coalition of willing states could establish their own special reparations task force to rectify the massive human rights wrongs committed by Russia in Ukraine.… It should be staffed by experts provided by countries whose central banks hold Russian foreign currency reserves, along with others from nonprofit and private sectors, preferably with government expertise. Representatives of the Ukrainian government should be involved.”

Litan has even set out a three-step process for carrying out the assignment of the fund and disbursing payments for claims against the money. The First would be establishing the mechanisms for reimbursing the costs of humanitarian relief being paid by those European nations sheltering Ukrainian refugees. Litan has suggested the amount of $5,000 per person. Assuming some five million refugees are eligible, that would amount to $25 billion. However, given the need to be prepared for more time before some refugees can return, perhaps $50 billion might be needed.

Second, a major portion of those Russian reserves would need to be set aside to compensate Ukrainians for the loss of their property in the hostilities. As he explains, “If reparations for 11 million Ukrainian family units (the population of 44 million divided by 4) averaged out to be $20,000 a family, the total would reach $220 billion. Add to this potentially tens of billions [more] to compensate surviving family members for the wrongful deaths of their loved ones, both military and civilian, caused by the Russian invasion.”

The third share would be the retention of a share of the reserves for the reconstruction of Ukraine, following the cessation of hostilities. This would assume Ukraine retained sovereignty over at least a portion of its territory or even the full extent of the country, if Ukraine were to actually prevail in battle. As Litan argues, “Until then, reconstruction funds would be held in trust and invested in income-producing assets. Russian-inflicted damages already likely exceed $100 billion, and will mount much higher as the war continues.”

Once the plan is established, nations holding Russian reserves could either have central banks transfer the full portion to an entity like the Bank for International Settlements (the central bank for all central banks) or through a defined schedule of distributions to an internationally agreed schedule.

Litan also suggests that if some portion of the $350 billion is held back, such funds could even be repaid to Russia upon agreement of the return of full sovereignty to Ukraine, or even dangled as an incentive for a new Russian leadership (hint, hint) to do the right thing in the future. The point being driven home, obviously, is that in the international environment, especially if a country embarks on a risky international adventure like this one, you have to pay to play, especially if things do not go so well for one. It is even possible such a repayment mechanism could become a more recognised roadmap for sorting out the damages from other hostilities like this one.

Naturally, though, given current circumstances, there is much ground to cover before actual negotiations begin over the future shape of Ukraine’s relationship with Russia and the West, let alone a mechanism for helping restore the lives and circumstances of the victims of the fighting. But even as the fighting rages on, it is crucial to start thinking through how the conflict must come to an end, and how the plight of the fighting’s victims will need to be addressed. DM"

20220322,"The United States and European Union have slammed a new sentence handed down to jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny, calling it a “sham” and another example of Russia’s widening crackdown on dissenting voices amid its invasion of Ukraine.

A Russian court on Tuesday sentenced Navalny to nine additional years in a maximum-security prison on fraud and contempt of court charges, as well as a fine of 1.2 million roubles ($11,500).

“The court’s sham ruling is the latest in a series of attempts to silence Navalny,” US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Tuesday afternoon.

“This disturbing decision … is another example of the Russian government’s widening crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression, which is intended to hide the Kremlin’s brutal war, and unprovoked war against Ukraine.”

The EU also condemned the ruling as “politically motivated”.

“The European Union deplores the systematic crackdown on civil society, independent media, individual journalists and human rights defenders in Russia,” the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a statement. “We reiterate our call on the Russian authorities for his immediate and unconditional release.”

“The world must not overlook this sentence and its significance amid the horrific human rights violations we have seen as a result of Russian aggression against Ukraine,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

The new sentence comes amid heightened tensions between Moscow and Western nations, which have condemned and slapped a series of biting sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

It also follows a year-long crackdown by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Navalny’s supporters, other opposition activists and independent journalists in which authorities appear eager to stifle all dissent.

Navalny’s close associates have faced criminal charges and left the country, and his group’s political infrastructure — an anti-corruption foundation and a nationwide network of regional offices — has been destroyed after being labelled an extremist organisation.

Navalny is already serving two-and-a-half years in a penal colony east of Moscow for a parole violation. The new trial was held in a makeshift courtroom at the facility.

In a Facebook post by his team shortly after the sentence on Tuesday, Navalny said: “My space flight is taking a bit longer than expected.”

His new conviction is on charges of embezzling money that he and his foundation raised over the years and of insulting a judge during a previous trial. Navalny, who will appeal the ruling, has rejected the allegations as politically motivated.

Germany also denounced the verdict on Tuesday, with its Foreign Ministry calling it “part of the systematic instrumentalisation of the Russian judicial system against dissidents and the political opposition”.

Putin’s most vocal domestic critic, the 45-year-old survived an attempt to poison him with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent, that he blames on the Kremlin. The Kremlin has said it had seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned and denied any Russian involvement if he was.

Earlier this month, Navalny urged Russians to hold daily protests against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has decimated Ukrainian cities and forced more than 3.5 million people to flee the country.

“I am urging everyone to take to the streets and fight for peace,” he said in statements posted on Facebook and Twitter on March 2, urging people not to be afraid of going to prison. “If, to prevent war, we need to fill up the jails and police vans, we will fill up the jails and police vans.”

Thousands of people have been arrested in anti-war protests across Russia since the country launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

Last week, Putin called for “self-purification” to rid Russia of anyone who opposes the war.

“[Russians] will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths,” he said in a speech that appeared to be a warning that his authoritarian rule could worsen. “I am convinced that such a natural and necessary self-purification of society will only strengthen our country.”"

Ethnic differences in Cyprus and Yugoslavia were demonized into burning hatreds, leading to major refugee and humanitarian crises during the last half-century. “There are many parallels between the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the Russian Invasion of Ukraine,” agreed Tasoula Berggren, an Simon Fraser University professor emerita in mathematics who for 20-plus years represented Cyprus in Vancouver. “It seems that Russia has been copying Turkey in this sad war.” We met at the turn of the century while I was making a documentary for Knowledge Network on peacekeeping in the region. The heart of Europe was also ravaged from 1991 through 2001 when the constituent republics of former Yugoslavia — Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia — exploded in similar ethnic strife.

In the land that triggered the First World War, the Balkans erupted into the worst conflagration since the Second World War. Almost exactly 30 years ago, the siege of Sarajevo began — it lasted 1,425 days, from April 4, 1992, to Feb. 29, 1996, the longest of a modern capital. The worst atrocity — later described as genocide — occurred in July 1995 when Bosnian Serbs overran Srebrenica, slaughtering almost 8,000 Muslim men and boys. There was widespread ethnic cleansing, rape used as a terror tactic and hellish butchery — nearly 140,000 people died. U.S. military involvement and a NATO bombing campaign finally imposed a bitter peace. More germane to Ukraine, however, may be the still-festering conflict in Cyprus — the island remains divided in spite of nearly 40 years of peace talks.

Settled by Greeks and Turks, Cyprus saw British colonial rule fan its ethnic divide into a blaze before they left in 1960. The island’s independence was reached through a grudging compromise between two reluctant antagonistic communities and, within three years, Greece was meddling, driving them further apart. Following a July 1974 Greek-backed coup on the island, Turkey invaded Cyprus, establishing control of a small slice before a ceasefire was declared. When the military junta collapsed weeks later, Turkey resumed its invasion and captured more than a third of the country before another ceasefire was declared. More than 150,000 people, nearly a third of the Greek-Cypriot population, were expelled from the northern part of the island. About 60,000 people, half the Turkish-Cypriots, were forced to move from the south to the north.

United Nations peacekeepers arrived and continue to maintain a buffer zone — “the Green Line” — on Cyprus. In 1983, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared independence; Turkey alone recognizes it. The split island joined the European Union in May 2004, although the rights and obligations of the EU don’t apply on the Turkish side. The international community refers to it as occupied EU territory and willfully ignored the irony of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan offering himself as a go-between in the current war. “I am afraid Ukraine will be also divided and the Russian army will stay there for years,” said Berggren, who retired last year as Cyrpus’s honorary consul. It’s hard to see another way out as the International Court of Justice, intended to put a brake on such aggression, seems to have been set up for failure.

Millions of Ukrainian refugees are being welcomed into Europe but navies were used to block African and Asian refugees fleeing no less heinous violence. But more importantly, why is NATO, a party with vested interests, and not some arms-length UN-led group backed by member nations, leading the efforts to resolve the war in Ukraine? Isn’t it time to drop the John Wayne-remember-the-Alamo talk and discuss realistically how to end the war as a global community instead of leaving it to some old white boy’s club, heirs of the racist conquerors who sowed the seeds of these wars?

20220327,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaks during a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (not pictured) in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank March 27, 2022. — Reuters pic

JERUSALEM, March 28 — US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and four top Arab diplomats arrived Sunday in southern Israel for a “historic” meeting marking a thawing of relations between the Jewish state and several regional neighbours.

The gathering with officials from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco — which in 2020 normalised ties with the Jewish state — and Egypt comes amid rising regional concerns over a deal Washington could soon reach with Iran to restore a 2015 nuclear agreement.

With the day of talks scheduled for Monday in the Sde Boker kibbutz, deep in Israel’s Negev desert, Israel aims to mark the success of the US-propelled “Abraham Accords” that saw the normalisation deals.

But the gathering’s opening was marred by a shooting attack in northern Israel that left two police officers dead and which authorities called a “terrorist” incident.

“All the foreign ministers condemned the attack, sent their condolences to the families of the victims and wished a speedy recovery to the wounded,” Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said on Twitter.

The meeting also takes place as the United States and European allies express quiet frustration that Middle East countries generally have not shown strong support for efforts to support Ukraine following Russia’s invasion or distanced themselves from Moscow.

But Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas rebuffed any pressure to criticise Russia, instead castigating the West for “double standards” that he said penalised Moscow while ignoring Israel’s “crimes” against the Palestinians.

“The current events in Europe have shown blatant double standards,” he told Blinken on Sunday.

“Despite the crimes of the Israeli occupation that amounted to ethnic cleansing and racial discrimination... we find no one who is holding Israel responsible for behaving as a state above the law,” he said.

The Iran nuclear deal was high on the agenda in meetings Blinken held Sunday with Lapid, Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

Speaking alongside Lapid, Blinken said the US believes restoring the agreement is “the best way to put Iran’s (nuclear) programme back in the box that it was in but has escaped” after the US withdrew from the deal under former president Donald Trump in 2018.

The European Union’s foreign policy chief said at the weekend that a deal with Iran to restore the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, could be reached “in a matter of days”.

Blinken stressed that “when it comes to the most important element, we see eye-to-eye” with Israel.

“We are both committed, both determined, that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon.”

Lapid said the two sides “have disagreements” about the deal, whose restoration is in the final stages of negotiation in Vienna after almost a year of talks.

But “open and honest dialogue is part of the strength of our friendship,” Lapid said.

“At the same time, Israel will do anything we believe is needed to stop the Iranian nuclear programme,” he added.

Bennett, after his meeting with Blinken, said Israel was specifically concerned that the US could meet one of Iran’s reported demands — to remove its designation of the country’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a “Foreign Terrorist Organisation.”

Speaking in Doha on Sunday, Robert Malley, the principal US negotiator for the Iran nuclear talks, played down that issue, noting that in any agreement the IRGC would remain under heavy US economic sanctions.

In his meetings with both sides on Sunday, Blinken also discussed strategies to ensure calm this year during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Christian Easter celebrations and the Jewish Passover holiday, which overlap.

Tensions in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, which Palestinians claim as their future capital, partly fuelled an 11-day conflict last May with Hamas Islamists who control the Gaza Strip.

Blinken stressed the need to “prevent actions on all sides that could raise tensions, including (Jewish) settlement expansion” in occupied Palestinian territories, comments marking a rare in-person condemnation of Israeli efforts to expand the Jewish settler population. — AFP"
20220328,"Seven European Union countries urge their citizens to refrain from joining the Ukrainian military resistance against Russia’s invading troops.

The appeal was issued by the justice ministers of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Luxembourg and Belgium.

The ministers of the seven countries “have unanimously discouraged Europeans from joining” the ranks of voluntary combatants heading to the war in Ukraine, according to a statement after their meeting in Brussels.

After Russian troops invaded on February 24, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky openly invited foreigners to come to his country’s aid as part of an “International Legion” that would fight side by side with Ukrainians.

On March 6, Ukraine said around 20,000 people had answered his call.

“We obviously discourage people to travel to a war zone,” French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin says after talks with his counterparts in Brussels. “To my knowledge, there have been very few departures from France that could be confirmed… almost none,” says Darmanin, whose country currently hold the presidency of the 27-member EU."
20220328,"Ukrainian forces have reclaimed control of a few small fronts in the country’s north, officials said Monday, as Russia appears to be directing its fiercest attacks on besieged areas in the country’s east and south, including Mariupol.

As the war grinds into its second month, Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to meet in Turkey on Tuesday for in-person negotiations. Kremlin officials have delivered icy remarks ahead of the talks, however, dampening prospects of a meaningful outcome. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday said his government should “stop indulging the Ukrainians” in negotiations.

In Washington, President Biden defended unscripted comments he made in Poland over the weekend when he said that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power.” He clarified that he was “expressing moral outrage” and echoed aides who has said his comments didn’t represent a change in U.S. policy or a campaign to remove the Russian leader.

Western intelligence officials and others say Moscow seems to be changing tactics to focus most intensely on the eastern Donbas region where the invasion began, after attempts to topple capital Kyiv and other key cities have stalled.

Ukrainian forces have taken back Trostianets, a town south of Sumy that is about 20 miles from Ukraine’s northeastern border with Russia, a senior U.S. defense official said. Ukrainian officials said the government had regained control of Irpin, a suburb of capital Kyiv.

Irpin Mayor Alexandar Markushin said in a video posted Monday that the area had been reclaimed and that “mopping up” was underway. Speaking from inside a vehicle and dressed in a green military-style vest, he told residents of the suburb not to return yet, as the fighting was ongoing.

In early March, Markushin described witnessing fatal attacks on citizens, including children, who were attempting to leave Irpin as Russian forces made their initial advance.

Ukrainian military officials separately said in a Facebook post that several Russian units had retreated toward Chernobyl in Ukraine’s north and over the border into Belarus to refresh their combat ability “as they have suffered significant losses.”

Despite the modest gains, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said there was no indication that Russia has fully reversed plans to take over or attack Kyiv. “According to our information, the Russian Federation has not 100 percent dropped their attempts if not to take at least to besiege the capital of Ukraine,” Ukrainian Defense Ministry official Sergey Rudskoy told reporters.

Rudskoy also gave updates on Russian losses, which could not be independently verified by The Washington Post. He said the Russian army had lost 17,000 people, 1,694 armored vehicles, 586 tanks, 302 artillery systems, 95 rocket systems, 123 aircraft and 66 drones. NATO last week estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed.

The British Defense Ministry said in a daily intelligence briefing that Russian forces have continued to advance in Ukraine’s south, with the most substantial gains in the besieged city of Mariupol, but also that some units are still struggling with logistics issues and low morale.

The mayor of Mariupol again called for the urgent evacuation of the city’s remaining 160,000 civilians, who have gone without basic necessities including food and electricity for weeks under a Russian blockade and fierce shelling.

But Ukrainian officials said there would be no immediate efforts to evacuate citizens from besieged cities through humanitarian corridors, citing “possible provocations” by Russian forces. Despite that, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a Telegram post on Monday morning that 586 residents had escaped Mariupol in their own vehicles on Sunday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday said he would like to meet Putin in a neutral country for eventual negotiations, striking a more conciliatory tone ahead of the talks in Turkey on Tuesday. He also said Ukraine is open to dialing back its ambitions to join NATO, an apparent concession to Moscow, on the condition that Russian troops exit the country.

The remarks, made in a rare interview with Russian journalists, were swiftly censored in Russia, which has tightened media controls to protect the Kremlin’s narrative about the war.

Russian officials have played down expectations for the talks.

“So far, we cannot and will not talk about progress,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a daily call with journalists on Monday.

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres on Monday joined calls for an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine to pave the way for “serious political negotiations,” adding that he was in close contact with countries including Turkey, Qatar, Israel, India, China, France and Germany to discuss mediation plans.

Turkey has also called for a reduction in the conflict. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told Putin in a telephone call on Sunday that a cease-fire and efforts to improve the humanitarian conditions were necessary.

The country’s proximity to the conflict has not only interrupted trade relations but raised safety alarms. The Turkish and Romanian defense ministries have in recent days worked to neutralize potentially explosive mines amid concerns that live weaponry could drift from Ukraine’s southern shores toward its Black Sea neighbors, according to statements by the respective ministries.

The Pentagon announced that it is deploying about 240 troops and six Navy electronic warfare aircraft to Germany in an effort to reinforce NATO powers in Eastern Europe.

“They are not being deployed to be used against Russian forces in Ukraine,” said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby. “They are being deployed completely in keeping with our efforts to bolster NATO’s deterrence and defense capabilities.”

The move nevertheless will probably anger Russia, which has cited NATO’s expansion in Europe as a pressure point in its decision to invade Ukraine. Kirby said the planes would not be used to jam Russian communications but would help bolster security in Eastern Europe.

Analysts say Biden’s comment over the weekend calling for Putin to be ousted also will probably worsen tensions and reaffirm anti-U.S. narratives in Moscow. Biden insisted on Monday that he was not “walking anything back” and would make no apologies. But he also reiterated that he is not calling for regime change in Moscow.

Since the invasion began, more than 3.8 million Ukrainians have fled the country into the European Union — over half of them children, according to E.U. officials. Most of the refugees have flowed into neighboring countries, primarily Poland, with about 1 million traveling to other countries across the bloc, Ylva Johansson, the E.U. commissioner for home affairs, said at a news conference in Brussels on Monday.

The exits from Ukraine have slowed, however, with daily arrivals shrinking from a peak of 100,000 a day to about 40,000, Johansson said.

Inside Russia, a battle over the use of foreign social media outlets continued Monday, amid Moscow’s crackdown on sites that report information outside the Kremlin’s official narrative.

A Russian court ruled that Facebook and Instagram users who don’t violate national laws can continue to use the sites, according to state-owned RIA news, despite the Kremlin earlier designating U.S. parent company Meta Platforms as an “extremist” organization.

Also Monday, the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta said it was suspending operations for the duration of the conflict. The outlet — edited by Nobel laureate Dmitry Muratov — was the last independent news organization operating inside Russia, which has outlawed most references to the war in Ukraine.

20220331,"On March 25, 2022, the European Union (EU) announced that the United States and the EU had reached an agreement in principle to replace the EU-U.S Privacy Shield framework, which the European Court of Justice (CJEU) struck down in its July 2020 Schrems II decision. Since the Schrems II decision, U.S. and EU negotiators have been hammering out a workable data transfer mechanism to permit the transfer of EU data to the United States.

What does the agreement provide?

The White House and European Commission each issued fact sheets that outline some of the details of the new agreement. The new data transfer framework will be called the “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework” (TADPF) and will address the concerns raised by the CJEU in the Schrems II decision regarding the expansive data collection activities of U.S. intelligence agencies and the lack of judicial remedies under U.S. laws for EU data subjects whose data is collected by these agencies. Specifically, the TADPF will ensure that:
• Binding safeguards will be in place to limit access to data by U.S. intelligence agencies to what is necessary and proportionate to protect legitimate national security objectives and will not disproportionately impact the protection of individual privacy and civil liberties;
• EU individuals will be able to seek redress for any improper collection of data by U.S. intelligence agencies from a new multi-layer redress mechanism that includes an independent Data Protection Review Court that will consist of individuals chosen from outside the U.S. government who will have full authority to adjudicate claims and direct remedial measures as needed; and
• U.S. intelligence agencies will adopt procedures to ensure effective oversight of new privacy and civil liberties standards.

Companies and organizations that implement the TADPF will be required to comply with many of the Privacy Shield principles, including the requirement to self-certify their compliance through the U.S. Department of Commerce. Additionally, like under the Privacy Shield, EU individuals will continue to have access to multiple avenues of recourse to resolve complaints against participating TADPF organizations, including through alternative dispute resolution and binding arbitration.

What are the next steps for the new framework?

The U.S. government and the European Commission will translate this agreement into legal documents that will need to be adopted on both sides to implement the TADPF. The United States will document its commitments in an executive order that will form the basis of the European Commission’s assessment in its future adequacy decision.

Thereafter, the European Commission must follow a multi-step process for issuing the adequacy decision for the new framework. First, the EU Commission must draft a written proposal for the adequacy decision. Second, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) must review and issue an opinion regarding the proposal. Third, representatives of the EU countries must approve the proposal. Fourth and finally, the European Commission must formally issue an adequacy decision finding that the new framework provides protections for EU data that are essentially equivalent to those provided under EU law, i.e., the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

This multi-step process will take time. For example, the process for issuing the adequacy decision for the Privacy Shield framework took six months from the European Commission’s proposal in February 2016 to the adoption the adequacy decision in August 2016.

Will the new framework be upheld by the CJEU?

This is the key question. The CJEU has twice invalidated data transfer mechanisms between the EU and United States, the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Framework in 2015 (the Schrems I decision) and the Privacy Shield in Schrems II, because of concerns regarding the collection activities of U.S. intelligence agencies and the lack of legal remedies for EU data subjects. Austrian privacy activist, Max Schrems who initiated the legal cases that resulted in both the Schrems I and Schrems II decisions, has already indicated that he will challenge the TADPF.

One thorny legal issue will be whether EU data subjects have an effective legal mechanism to challenge the U.S. government’s collection of their data under the TADPF. Currently, the ability of an EU data subject to obtain judicial redress against the U.S. government regarding its surveillance activities is severely restricted because U.S. surveillance activities are highly secret and EU data subjects must overcome the formidable obstacle of showing they have standing to sue the U.S. government because they have been harmed by these secretive practices.

What do employers need to know?

The key takeaways for EU companies and U.S. companies with employees in the EU are:
• There is no indication that EU regulators will grant a grace period from enforcement activities while the European Commission undertakes its adequacy decision process to finalize the TADPF. Thus, employers are still required to comply with current EU data transfer requirements by using EU standard contract clauses (SCCs), binding corporate rules (BCRs), or the derogations under the GDPR to transfer EU human resources data to the United States until the TADPF is operational. Employers using SCCs or BCRs must also conduct a transfer impact assessment (TIA) to analyze whether EU human resources data can be safely transferred under current U.S. surveillance laws and whether supplementary technical, contractual or organizational measures must be implemented to adequately protect the transferred data.
• Once the TADPF becomes effective, it will apply only to data transfers from EU/EEA countries to the United States. Data transfers from the UK and Switzerland, which previously recognized the Privacy Shield for transfer of data to the United States, will still need to comply with the UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) and its version of the TIA, the Transfer Risk Assessment (TRA), or the UK addendum to the SCCs, and the TIA for UK data transfers; and the Swiss addendum to the SCCs and the TIA for Swiss data transfers. Given the expected legal challenges to the TADPF, it is unclear whether the UK or Switzerland will adopt the TADPF to permit data transfers to the United States from their respective countries.
• Similarly, it is unclear at this point whether the TADPF can or will cover onward transfers of human resources data to other third countries like India, such as situations in which a U.S. parent company receives a transfer of human resources data from its EU subsidiary and then transfers this EU data to a payroll company or other vendor in India. Thus, employers may still need to use SCCs and conduct a TIA for such onward transfers.
• Finally, even after the TADPF is operational, employers using the TADPG may wish to continue using the technical, contractual, and organizational supplementary measures under their current SCCs or BCRs in the event that the TADPF is invalidated by a Schrems III decision, which, like the Schrems II decision, may fail to provide a grace period to find an alternate legal transfer mechanism."
20220330,"PRESS RELEASE – The United States is providing $356.2 million to support the democratic transition in the Republic of Sudan following a peaceful revolution in 2019.



The Acting Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), John Barsa, announced this commitment today at the Sudan Partnership Conference, a virtual event co-hosted by the European Union, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Transitional Government of Sudan, and the United Nations.

 

 

 

 The U.S. commitment includes $20 million, subject to Congressional notification, for the Sudan Family-Support Program, a safety net administered by the World Food Programme to help a large part of the Sudanese population through a difficult period of economic reform needed to end unsustainable state subsidies on wheat and oil. It also includes funds to help Sudan respond to the pandemic of COVID-19.

The U.S. Government has long been a leading donor to support the welfare of the people of Sudan. Today’s announcement represents a nearly tenfold increase in U.S. Government development assistance compared to 2019, which reflects cautious optimism regarding Sudan’s democratic transition. The funds will strengthen local and national institutions; address drivers of conflict; expand civic engagement, particularly among youth, women, religious minorities, and other marginalized communities; and assist with the planning and eventual conduct of credible, inclusive, and peaceful elections.

The transition to a civilian-led, transparent, and accountable democracy remains fraught with challenges. The United States continues to stand by the Sudanese people and civilian government in their pursuit of a just, peaceful, and democratic transition. The United States calls on all others to support the people of Sudan as they make progress toward that goal.

As the world’s largest donor of humanitarian assistance, USAID is also maintaining its robust aid for the most vulnerable people in Sudan.

It is recalled that the United States and Sudan has cut diplomatic relations in 1967 during the Arab-Israel war. Relations improved after July 1971, when the Sudanese Communist Party attempted to overthrow President Nimeiri, and Nimeiri suspected Soviet involvement. U.S. assistance for resettlement of refugees following the 1972 peace settlement with the south added further improved relations, according to the information from the website of the U.S Embassy in Sudan."
20220401,"The European Union should encourage Georgia's European perspective, the Speaker of the Parliament of Georgia, Shalva Papuashvili, said in an article published on Thursday by Euractiv.

In the article, Papuashvili focuses on the challenges posed by the war in Ukraine and Georgia’s western path on, focusing on the 2014 Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia, and the country’s formal EU membership bid.

The war in Ukraine highlights not only Georgia’s security predicament but also the long way the country has come since the 2008 invasion by Russia. While becoming a member state may take time, the EU must send the right signals to an overwhelmingly pro-EU country that has paid a heavy price for its Western aspirations,” Papuashvili writes.

The Georgian official also argues despite the dynamic and evolving cooperation, the EU failed to send clear signals about eventual membership for Georgia, pointing out Georgian public’s support for membership has grown in recent years.

The EU should, therefore, extend the enlargement process not only to Georgia, but also to Ukraine and Moldova. Together, this trio could coordinate reform progress, discuss strategies, and share best practices in ensuring expeditious compliance with the EU acquis,” the Parliament Speaker notes.

Papuashvili also draws parallels to the end of the Cold War and the 2004 enlargement, emphasising the EU must realize that “it is facing another decisive moment” and embrace its responsibility to integrate Georgia into the Union."
20220402,"YEREVAN, MARCH 31, ARMENPRESS. The Secretary of the Security Council of Armenia Armen Grigoryan met with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev’s Assistant Hikmet Hajiyev in Brussels on March 30, the European Union External Action Service said in a press release.

“The European Union hosted a meeting of high-level officials from Armenia and Azerbaijan in Brussels today to advance joint efforts to find solutions to a range of issues between both countries. In particular, discussions focused on preparations for the upcoming meeting between President Charles Michel of the European Council, President Ilham Aliyev of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of the Republic of Armenia in Brussels on 6 April 2022.

The meeting between Secretary of the Security Council of the Republic of Armenia, Armen Grigoryan, and Assistant to the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Hikmet Hajiyev, was facilitated by EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus Toivo Klaar.

During substantive discussions, which also included a separate bilateral conversation between Mr Hajiyev and Mr Grigoryan, the participants reviewed the political and security situation and the full spectrum of issues between Armenia and Azerbaijan as a follow-up to the understandings reached during the meeting of leaders of both countries and President Michel, held in Brussels on 14 December 2021.

The participants agreed to meet again over the coming weeks in order to continue discussions, among others on issues raised during the leaders’ meeting of 14 December 2021. Armenia and Azerbaijan will also address issues related to prospects for a peace agreement between them.

The European Union remains committed to continue its engagement towards sustainable peace and stability in the South Caucasus,” the European Union External Action Service said."
20220402,"YEREVAN, MARCH 31, ARMENPRESS. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev held a meeting with Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, OSCE Chairman-in-Office Zbigniew Rau in Baku.

“This is a good opportunity to discuss the important issues on our agenda. Of course, as the OSCE Chairman-in-Office, you and I will discuss the post-conflict situation in the region. At the same time, the bilateral agenda between Poland and Azerbaijan is very extensive. As you may know, we recently had a telephone conversation with President Andrzej Duda. I have very good memories of my meetings with the President in Warsaw, Baku and Davos. You are aware that we are in regular contact and the relations between our countries are a good demonstration of a strong partnership between us.

We are also grateful to Poland for its continuous support in matters of cooperation with the European Union. This process is now in full swing, and the European Union has already announced that a new meeting between the Armenian prime minister and myself will be organized by President Charles Michel. I do hope that this meeting will be productive, because there have already been several meetings and we must move towards peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia and sign a peace agreement as soon as possible. In our view, Azerbaijan has laid out the main principles of this agreement,” the Azerbaijani AZERTAC State News Agency quoted President Aliyev as saying at the meeting.

President Aliyev again falsely claimed that “the conflict has already been resolved.”

“….and now is the time to normalize relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We are receiving certain messages from Armenian officials. As I was recently informed that one of these messages is that they consider our proposal acceptable. This is very good news, and I hope that this issue will be clarified at the meeting in Brussels.

The five principles we have initiated reflect the norms of international law and good international conduct. We are not inventing a bicycle here, so to speak. All these principles are the fundamental principles of interstate relations between any countries. Reciprocal recognition of territorial integrity and inviolability of international borders, and then the delimitation of borders – I think that peace will come to the Caucasus on this basis. We want it. We are seeing the potential for active cooperation amongst the three countries of the South Caucasus, and I think that this will be important not only for these countries but also for the wider region. Of course, all these issues need to be addressed very carefully and in a timely manner,” Aliyev added.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan earlier said that there is nothing unacceptable for Armenia in the 5-point proposals for peace talks handed over by Azerbaijan, and that Yerevan has responded to Baku.

The OSCE Chairman-in-Office and Poland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Zbigniew Rau is expected to arrive to Armenia on March 31."
20220405,"The administration of US President Joe Biden will impose new sanctions on Russia this week that include a ban on new investments and sanctions on Russian government officials and their family members, according to reports.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday that the sanctions were being coordinated with the Group of Seven and the European Union.

She said that the sanctions will also target Russian-owned financial institutions and state-owned enterprises.

She said that the sanctions are in response to Russia’s recent atrocities in Bucha, a town near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, and other acts of violence in Ukraine.

“We are continuing to assess and make decisions about additional consequences and steps we can put in place,” Psaki said during the White House briefing.

Earlier on Tuesday, the European Union proposed a fresh batch of sanctions against Russia over the military conflict in Ukraine, amid divisions among the bloc’s leaders on whether to restrict Russia's energy imports into the continent.

The European Commission proposed the new measures, including a ban on coal imports and blocking Russian ships from entering European ports.

The new package, which needs to be approved unanimously by the bloc’s 27 member states, is likely to restrict the leasing of airplanes and the import and export of products like jet fuel, steel products and luxury goods as well.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video address that additional sanctions, including on oil imports, were being worked out.

“The four packages of sanctions have hit hard and limited the Kremlin’s political and economic options. In view of events we need to increase our pressure further,” she said.

Western countries have slapped unprecedented sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin declared a military offensive against Ukraine on February 24.

The new measures were proposed after Ukrainian troops began showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces in Bucha and other towns near Kiev.

Von der Leyen accused Moscow of “waging a cruel, ruthless war, also against Ukraine's civilian population,” saying that the bloc needed “to sustain utmost pressure at this critical point.”

Russia denied any civilian killings, saying that the images were fakes produced by Ukrainian forces or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out of the areas.

""It is a simply a well-directed but tragic show,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""It is a forgery aimed at denigrating the Russian army. And it will not work.""

He also said that the Kremlin urged ""the international community: detach yourself from such emotional perceptions and think with your head. Compare the facts and understand what a monstrous forgery we are dealing with.""

The Biden administration has imposed harsh economic and banking sanctions on Russia in response to Russia's military actions in Ukraine.

Biden said the sanctions would limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen.

The US president claimed that the only other alternative to the sanctions would be to start a “Third World War.”

President Putin said earlier this month that Western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war.

A top Greek diplomat told The Hill in an interview in Washington, DC, published last month that the coordinated Western sanctions against Russia over its military campaign in Ukraine are aimed at regime change in Moscow.

Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Varvitsiotis Miltiadis hailed Biden for goading countries to impose coordinated sanctions on Moscow, but lamented Turkey’s absence from the Western push to punish Putin."

20220407,"What’s Happening: The EU’s Head of Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrel, summed up the April 1 EU-China summit meeting concisely as a “dialogue of the deaf.” While Beijing wanted to focus on areas of cooperation and collaboration, Brussels had other priorities. EU leaders urged Beijing to use its influence to end the Ukraine/Russia conflict and warned against undermining sanctions. Beijing pushed back, suggesting that Brussels was too beholden to Washington, and urged the EU to “adopt an independent China policy.” The summit ended with no joint statement and few clear deliverables.

The Background: The 23rd EU-China Summit resumed annual bilateral talks that had been disrupted for two years by the pandemic. An abundance of issues were overdue for discussion, including COVID recovery, climate change, trade, the digital economy, human rights, and more, but differences over the Ukraine crisis loomed largest for Europe. The EU signaled its desire to prioritize discussion of the conflict in the days leading up to the summit, but Beijing sought to direct discussion away from Ukraine by playing to the EU’s desire for “strategic autonomy” vis-à-vis China and the United States. Those appeals fell flat in the context of the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II.

As European Council President Charles Michel put it, this EU-China meeting was not “business as usual,” but “a war-time summit.” EU leaders stuck firm to their agenda, seeking to dissuade China from directly or indirectly enabling Russian aggression. Brussels stressed that support for Russia carried huge reputational risks for Chinese businesses in Europe, urged Beijing to use its influence to end the Ukraine/Russia conflict, and warned that the global economic and security consequences of a prolonged war were in no one’s interest. As was the case in last month’s phone call with President Joe Biden, President Xi Jinping reportedly avoided any explicit commitment to refrain from supporting Moscow, either militarily or economically. Xi did emphasize that China supports and has been encouraging peace talks, but overall, the summit outcomes revealed little common ground.

Although tensions have been building in EU-China relations for several years now, last week’s summit marked a sharp downturn since the December 2020 meeting when the conclusion of the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) was announced. That agreement, which one European parliamentarian described at the time as having “allowed China to drive a huge wedge between the U.S. and Europe,” is now indefinitely on hold. The United States and the European Union have presented a strongly united front in response to Russian aggression. Beijing’s efforts to balance strategic friendship with Moscow against constructive engagement with Brussels, meanwhile, appear to have run China up against an EU red line.

Why it Matters: While Beijing has come to terms with its fraught relationship with Washington, it had hoped that it could “divide and conquer” the West by navigating a more productive relationship with Brussels. From their vantage point, this seemed to make sense given the extensive commercial ties between Europe and China. By the numbers, China is the EU’s largest trading partner and the EU is China’s second-largest, after ASEAN. EU-China bilateral trade in goods was valued at more than $758 billion last year, and the EU consumed more than 15% of all Chinese exports.

But through its wolf warrior diplomacy, human rights violations, Lithuanian economic coercion, and other practices, Beijing has sewn doubts in Europe about China’s commitment to free and fair trade and its interest in upholding core tenets of the rules-based order. Its cozy relations with Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orbán, meanwhile, have stoked concerns that China and the EU’s respective ideals and values may be incompatible. Through its own actions (and inactions), China has contributed to the strengthening of the transatlantic relationship, despite Europe’s anxieties over a resurgence of America first isolationism. Beijing’s attempts to have it both ways on the Ukraine/Russia conflict have only pushed Europe and the United States closer together and fueled a downward trajectory in European attitudes.

Next Steps: In response to recently discovered Russian atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, the United States, EU, and G7 members just announced a new set of sanctions. These include a ban on new investment in Russia, full blocking sanctions on two of Russia’s largest financial institutions, and additional financial restrictions on several major state-owned enterprises, as well as various Russian government officials and their families. This will further distance Europe from China, particularly if Beijing continues to resist acknowledging or condemning Russia’s apparent war crimes, as it did at the United Nations earlier this week.

Based on past Chinese behavior, we can expect Beijing to pressure European companies doing business in China to be vocal on the need to improve EU-China relations, and it may even make regulatory concessions to get into the good graces of European industry. Beijing will also likely step up outreach to individual member states in an effort to work around Brussels. This will almost certainly be China’s approach to Germany, with its large manufacturing investments in China, and to France, which holds the EU Presidency until June.

Chinese overtures to other European parties are already underway. Within hours of Orbán’s sweeping April 4 electoral victory, Beijing reaffirmed close ties with Budapest. Under Orbán’s rule, Hungary has blocked numerous EU resolutions that China opposed. Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Hungarian counterpart agreed on Monday to enhance their countries’ “comprehensive strategic partnership.” On April 5, President Xi and Serbian President Aleksander Vucic similarly confirmed China and Serbia’s continued partnership following news of Vucic’s reelection.

Though China may not want to mediate the crisis, there are also signs of Beijing stepping up direct efforts to encourage a resolution. European leaders have urged Xi to exert more influence on Russia and to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who himself has beseeched Beijing to “play a more prominent role” in ending the conflict. On April 4, Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke via telephone with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, and offered to “continue to play an important role for a ceasefire.” Kuleba tweeted that the two “share the conviction that ending the war against Ukraine serves common interests of peace, global food security, and international trade.”

The EU and the United States, meanwhile, will hold the next meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) on May 15-16. The gathering offers an inflection point for Washington and Brussels to further cooperation on Russia sanctions, export controls, technology standards, resilient supply chains, and more. Transatlantic ties are the strongest they have been in recent years, and it is no coincidence that President Biden visited Europe just one week before the EU-China Summit was held.

What to Watch: Despite the current transatlantic relationship renaissance, Washington needs to keep its expectations of Europe in check. Given the economic fallout Europe is facing from the Russia-Ukraine war, there are brass tacks economic reasons why Europe may hesitate to take on its largest trading partner simultaneously. Unlike the “no limits” China-Russia relationship, the United States and Europe have long recognized that their coordination on economic matters involving China has constraints.

20220410,"The deaths of over 50 civilians in the Friday shelling of the Kramatorsk railway station in eastern Ukraine mark the grisly symbolic opening of the second chapter of Russia's war on Ukraine. Russia is saying in the language of blood that the reorientation of its primary offensive to the east, away from Kyiv and towards the Donbas region, will be as brutal and unsparing of civilians.

War crimes, it appears, are not incidental to the Russian war machine, but part of its method. Copious witness testimony in recent days attests to its deliberate nature. And German intelligence has now intercepted open, candid discussion on radio between Russian troops of their use of torture and civilian killing.

But the new chapter will also usher in a new type of war, military observers warn – a more conventional ground war from entrenched positions involving heavy fighting into the foreseeable future. And that reality has important implications for how Ukraine will fight to defend itself, and for how western allies continue to help.

Ukraine’s success on the battlefields around Kyiv has to date been largely thanks to nimble guerrilla-style tactics against stalled, static forces, and the smart use of portable equipment, largely supplied by the west, including drones and shoulder-held anti-tank missiles.

Visiting Brussels on Thursday for a Nato foreign ministers' meeting, Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, put his requirements simply as ""weapons, weapons, weapons"", and stepped up his government's demands for tanks, fighter jets and long-range anti-aircraft missile systems. But fears of provoking escalation into a direct conflict with Nato mean that the west remains unwilling to supply aircraft. And crates of Javelin missiles are one thing, dispatching highly visible convoys of armoured vehicles quite another.

The European Union has so far approved €900 million in weapons aid and another €100 million of non-lethal supplies, and Nato ministers made clear more will be forthcoming, largely from its member states on a bilateral basis. But it will not be easy. Some countries, like Estonia, are already finding that their stocks of weapons are depleted, while supplies of tanks and aged kit from other former Warsaw pact countries that can be put to use quickly are also in short supply. The Czechs are reported to be supplying 100 Soviet-designed T-72 tanks immediately, and such weapons can easily be used immediately by Ukraine's forces.

More problematic is the modern heavy materiel potentially on offer from Germany and others for this new stage of war – tanks but also vital anti-aircraft batteries. These will require training that takes time. It is not clear, however, how much time Ukraine has. Russia's redeployment of massive firepower to the Donbas is well under way."

KYIV/LVIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine - Russian missile strikes hit Ukraine's capital Kyiv and other cities on Saturday, as Moscow said its troops had cleared the urban area of Mariupol and only a small contingent of Ukrainian fighters remained inside a steelworks in the besieged southern port.

Russia's claim to have all but taken control of Mariupol, scene of the war's heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe, could not be independently verified. It would be the first major city to have fallen to Russian forces since the Feb. 24 invasion.

""The situation is very difficult"" in Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Ukrainska Pravda news portal. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis ... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

Russia's defense ministry said if Ukrainian forces in the giant Azovstal steelworks lay down their arms starting at 0300 GMT on Sunday, their lives would be spared, Tass news agency said. There was no immediate response from Kyiv.

As Moscow launched long-range missile attacks across the country following the sinking of its Black Sea flagship, Moscow said its warplanes had struck a tank repair factory in Kyiv on Saturday. An explosion was heard and smoke rose over the southeastern Darnytskyi district. The mayor said at least one person was killed and medics were fighting to save others.

The Ukrainian military said Russian warplanes that took off from Belarus had fired missiles at the Lviv region near the Polish border and four cruise missiles were shot down by Ukrainian air defenses.

The western city has been relatively unscathed so far and serves as a haven for refugees and international aid agencies.

In Mariupol, Reuters journalists in Russian-held districts reached the Ilyich steelworks, one of two metals plants where defenders had held out in underground tunnels and bunkers. Moscow claimed to have captured it on Friday.

The factory was reduced to a ruin of twisted steel and blasted concrete, with no sign of defenders present. Several bodies of civilians lay scattered on nearby streets.

The Russian defense ministry said its troops had ""completely cleared"" Mariupol's urban area of Ukrainian forces and blockaded the ""remnants"" in the Azovstal steelworks, RIA news agency said. It said that as of Saturday, Ukrainian forces in the city had lost more than 4,000 personnel.

Later on Saturday, Zelensky accused Russia of ""deliberately trying to destroy everyone"" in Mariupol and said his government was in touch with the defenders. But he did not address Moscow's claim that Ukrainian forces were no longer in urban districts.

The governor of Kharkiv province in the east said at least one person was killed and 18 injured in a missile strike. Smoke billowed from burning cars and the remains of what appeared to be an office building in the city.

In Mykolaiv, a city close to the southern front, Russia said it had struck a military vehicle repair factory.

The attacks followed Russia's announcement on Friday it would intensify long-range strikes in retaliation for unspecified acts of ""sabotage"" and ""terrorism"", hours after it confirmed the sinking of its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva.

Kyiv and Washington say the ship, whose sinking has become a symbol of Ukrainian defiance, was hit by Ukrainian missiles. Moscow says it sank after a fire and its crew of around 500 were evacuated.

Russia's Defense Ministry published video of the head of the navy, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, meeting on a parade ground with about a hundred sailors it said were members of the crew.

A month and a half into President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Russia is trying to capture territory in the south and east after withdrawing from the north following an assault on Kyiv that was repelled at the capital's outskirts.

Russian troops that pulled out of the north left behind towns littered with bodies of civilians, evidence of what US President Joe Biden this week called genocide.

Russia denies targeting civilians and says the aim of its ""special military operation"" is to disarm its neighbor, defeat nationalists and protect separatists in the southeast.

'Mariupol will always be Ukraine'

If Mariupol falls it would be Russia's biggest prize of the war so far. It is the main port of the Donbas, a region of two provinces in the southeast which Moscow demands be fully ceded to separatists.

The owner of both of the giant steelworks in Mariupol, Ukraine's richest man Rinat Akhmetov, vowed to rebuild the city. ""Mariupol has been and will always be a Ukrainian city,"" Akhmetov told Reuters.

Ukraine says it has so far held off Russian advances elsewhere in the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where at least one person was killed in shelling overnight.

Ukraine gained the upper hand in the early phase of a war, in part by successfully deploying mobile units armed with anti-tank missiles supplied by the West against Russian armored convoys confined to roads by muddy terrain.

But Putin appears determined to capture more Donbas territory to claim victory in a war that has left Russia subject to increasingly punitive Western sanctions and with few allies.

The Ukrainian military command in the east of the country, where Kyiv says it expects a major assault, said in a Facebook post it had repelled 10 attacks on Saturday, destroying 15 tanks, 24 other armored vehicles and three artillery systems. Reuters could not independently verify the report.

Zelensky told Ukrainian reporters the world should prepare for the possibility Russia might use nuclear weapons. He did not give evidence for the assertion.

Last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would resort to nuclear weapons only in the case of a ""threat to the existence"" of the country — and not as a result of the Ukraine conflict.

An advisor to Zelensky said the country needed a swifter supply of weapons from its European Union partners.

The Russian defense ministry said its anti-aircraft systems in the Odesa region shot down a Ukrainian transport plane delivering weapons supplied by Western governments. It did not provide any evidence. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv.

Zelensky said about 2,500-3,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed so far and up to 20,000 Russian troops.

Moscow has given no updates on its casualties since March 25, when it said 1,351 had died. Western estimates of Russian losses are many times higher.

Ukraine says civilian deaths are impossible to count, estimating at least 20,000 killed in Mariupol alone.

Overall, around a quarter of Ukrainians have been driven from their homes, including a tenth of the population that has fled abroad. —Reuters"
20220421,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a remarkable alignment of international actors supporting accountability processes. The international community — states, regional bodies, civil society and the U.N. — has provided funding and expertise to the Ukrainian government and launched documentation and evidence collection efforts, fact-finding missions and criminal investigations into Russia’s invasion and the crimes committed against Ukrainian civilians. The progress made to date stands to advance the rights of Ukrainians and other vulnerable communities faced with aggressive state action. Moving forward, this united effort will require the coordination, creativity and sustained political will to ensure that perpetrators are held accountable, and that justice is delivered to victims.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is perhaps the most documented conflict of the 21st century. Internet penetration in Ukraine far exceeds that of Syria during the 2011 uprising and ensuing civil conflict, and the result is that Russian attacks and their aftermath have been well documented through social and traditional media. As of April 18, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights recorded 2,072 civilians killed and 2,818 injured. But anecdotal evidence — including that shared by Ukrainians through their mobile devices — suggests that number will grow as investigators collect evidence, including exhuming mass graves in conflict-ravaged cities like Bucha and Mariupol. Further, large-scale killings of civilians are far from the only crimes that Ukrainians have suffered. Reporting suggests that sexual violence and torture are widespread, and the fighting has resulted in considerable damage to civilian infrastructure.

More than 7,000 investigations have been opened by the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office since the war began. Completing those investigations — during an active armed conflict that is likely to generate further crimes and more investigations — is a daunting yet critical task. Consideration of this task led the U.S. Institute of Peace and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights to convene an expert discussion on strategies for pursuing accountability for atrocity crimes in Ukraine.

Echoing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s recent call, Kerry Kennedy, a USIP Board member and the president of RFK Human Rights, underscored calls from leaders around the world for a firm response to the crisis in Ukraine. Here's what the world can do.

Coordinating Investigative Efforts is Crucial to their Effectiveness

Coordination of the various investigative efforts will promote efficiency in the investigative process, widening its reach and allowing accountability mechanisms to consider crimes committed by a broader range of actors. Ukrainian Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova highlighted the importance of coordination to her office’s ability to respond to the vast investigative needs arising from the invasion. Partnerships with the United States and the European Union provide expert support to Ukrainian prosecutors conducting investigations, including field investigations in towns like Bucha. In addition, 13 state-led investigations into Russia’s conduct in Ukraine allow for evidence collection from refugees who have fled the violence.

Civilians have further supplemented the evidence collected through submissions to an online portal established through the Prosecutor General’s Office. These submissions include photos and videos taken on mobile devices. However, as Mark Ellis, the president of the International Bar Association (IBA), noted, without further processes of authentication and a secure chain of custody to dispel concerns of evidence manipulation, much of that evidence will be inadmissible in court proceedings. Ellis noted that the IBA has worked successfully to respond to this challenge through its EyeWitness to Atrocities project, which allows civilians to capture evidence on an app that collects and securely stores data relevant to its authenticity for use in future court proceedings. According to Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack, improving the admissibility of evidence collected by civilians is critical to recognizing the great personal risk civilians frequently take to collect evidence.

These investigative efforts may support a range of accountability processes, including Ukrainian prosecutions, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe fact-finding efforts, the Independent International Commission on Inquiry on Ukraine established by the U.N. Human Rights Council, national prosecutions in states with universal jurisdiction over atrocity crimes or jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Each of these accountability processes maintains different standards for evidence collection, however, which may limit how collected information is used. Former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer recognized that in past instances where atrocity crimes occurred, different evidentiary standards frequently delayed proceedings. To improve the efficiency of accountability processes, Breuer recommended a meeting of international actors to coordinate the way in which evidence is collected and used by accountability mechanisms.

In considering options to deliver accountability, creativity and broad thinking must drive international decision making, finding ways to address the unique nature of the crimes committed and to provide justice and reparations for Ukrainian civilians. According to Van Schaack, Russia has pursued a war of aggression with atrocities as its primary tactic. This presents a unique challenge to the international criminal justice architecture, which is fully empowered to address atrocities, but faces gaps in addressing the crime of aggression.

Creative thinking in response to this challenge is reflected in several proposals to respond to ongoing atrocities in Ukraine. In the past week, Zelensky backed a proposal to establish a special tribunal to consider the crime of aggression as it relates to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This special tribunal would function as an ad hoc tribunal, similar to those created to try atrocity crimes in Rwanda, Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone. It may be an international or a hybrid tribunal, with both international and domestic components. Among the proponents of such a tribunal is former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who said he sees the tribunal as an opportunity to deliver justice to Ukrainians more quickly than they are likely to see from the ICC and other international accountability mechanisms. Brown posited a special tribunal on the crime of aggression could indict Putin within weeks given the wealth of publicly available evidence surrounding the planning and preparation for Russia’s war against Ukraine. By contrast, indicting Putin for his role in ongoing atrocity crimes will require a painstaking process of establishing command responsibility before an indictment may be issued. While the tribunal would be unlikely to try Putin until a political settlement to the conflict has been reached, issuing an indictment would be significant for demonstrating progress in the accountability process.

In addition, a broader conception of accountability could consider reparations for the damages sustained by Ukrainian civilians. The damage to Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure is considerable, and it will take years for the country to rebuild. Further, many of Ukraine’s civilians have incurred considerable losses of personal property. The international community should therefore consider how reparations may be provided, including through the establishment of a reparations fund. Former Georgian Foreign Minister Eka Tkeshelashvili suggested that the international community should establish a compensation fund for Ukrainian civilians, potentially using Russian assets and central bank reserves frozen by sanctions at the outset of the conflict. Harold Koh, a former U.S. State Department legal adviser, suggested that such reparations could be modeled after the U.N. Compensation Commission established to provide reparations to Kuwaitis affected by Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

While these proposals are likely to receive considerable attention in the coming weeks, experts cautioned against placing too much emphasis on the potential impact of any particular accountability mechanism. Remaining flexible will be critical to ensuring that broad range of mechanisms are able to deliver accountability and to highlighting the successes of overall accountability efforts. Koh argued that the international community should be prepared to support whichever institution is able to achieve accountability, whether it is the Ukrainian Prosecutor General, the ICC or a new tribunal established to consider the crime of aggression.

Maintaining Political Will is Essential to Delivering Justice

Finally, maintaining political will is essential to effectively delivering accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims of Russia’s crimes in Ukraine. The international community must continue to provide moral, material and financial support to not only accountability efforts but also to Ukrainian efforts to repel the Russian invasion. USIP’s Ambassador Bill Taylor recognized that for processes of accountability to be effective, particularly in holding Russian leadership accountable, Ukraine must win the war. Further, accountability must remain a focus of the international community during peace talks. It cannot be sidelined for the “convenience for political negotiations” said Tkeshelashvili, who now serves as the head of program for the Support to Anti-Corruption Champion Institutions in Ukraine. Finally, the international community must continue to provide financial and material support to accountability efforts. Latvia, for instance, has provided funding to the efforts of the ICC — other international actors should follow suit. Breuer called upon the U.S. to send Department of Justice and former war crimes prosecutors to the ICC and any special tribunals formed to respond to the conflict. Such support will ensure that the tribunals are equipped to meet the challenge of holding perpetrators accountable.

International unity on the issue of accountability sends an important message to perpetrators and would-be perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression that such crimes will not be tolerated. The international community must now channel this unity into mechanisms that effectively deliver accountability for perpetrators of atrocities in Ukraine and justice for victims."
20220428,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko reportedly have plans to strengthen their ""Union State"" and are looking to attract other former members of the dissolved Soviet Union, but the likelihood of other ex-USSR republics joining seems low in the face of the Ukrainian invasion.

Belarus has remained one of Russia's top allies since the start of the Russia-Ukraine War in late February, which drew condemnation from around the globe. But reports from Belarus' state-owned BelTA news agency indicate that Lukashenko and Putin are interested in taking the relationship between their countries to a more cooperative level in a move reminiscent of the former USSR, though authorities have yet to confirm these reports.

""We are building a single Union State on the new principles to ensure that everyone's interests are respected, that the sovereign independent states—Belarus and Russia—keep developing. I am sure that this union will attract other republics of the former Soviet Union,"" BelTA quoted Lukashenko as saying during a meeting with Governor of Russia's Voronezh Oblast Aleksandr Gusev in Minsk on Thursday.

The Soviet Union was established in December 1922 and eventually grew to encompass 15 nations: Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, according to History.com.

Leaders of four former Soviet Union nations have firmly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, making it unlikely that they would be willing to join a new iteration of the USSR.

Latvian President Egils Levits immediately condemned Russia's invasion when it began on February 24 and has remained vocal in support of Ukraine in the months since. He has made calls on Twitter, for example, for Ukraine to be admitted speedily into the European Union.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda also took to Twitter on February 24 to express his condemnation and call for a response.

""I strongly condemn Russia's military attack against #Ukraine. It endangers millions of innocent people & undermines the foundations of international order. It is up for the West now to respond appropriately! #StandWithUkraine,"" he tweeted.

He also immediately called for ""tough sanctions"" against Russia and expressed the need for solidarity and readiness ""in the face of raging evil.""

Moldova's President Maia Sandu added to the chorus of condemnation that same day by immediately decrying the invasion as an ""act of war"" and describing the attack as a ""blatant breach of international law"" and Ukraine's territorial sovereignty.

""As a neutral state, Moldova stands ready to assist [Ukrainian] citizens in their humanitarian needs,"" she tweeted.

Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, also on February 24, tweeted: ""I condemn in the gravest manner #Russia's large-scale military attack against #Ukraine. Aggression is a crime that demands the clearest international reaction and strong response. We are with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people at this dark hour. We #StandWithUkraine.""

She decried reports of civilian attacks and other ""horrific scenes"" in Ukraine in an Economist essay published earlier this month.

The stances of other ex-Soviet states have been less clear, particularly in the region of Central Asia. Kazakhstan, for example, has not condemned Russia's invasion. But it has provided Ukraine with humanitarian aid, said it will heed Western sanctions against Russia and called for the conflict to be resolved in line with the United Nations charter, Reuters reported.

Azerbaijan, in the Caucasus region, has also provided aid to Ukraine, according to a February 26 tweet from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But the country's leaders have largely walked a cautious line in terms of taking sides, according to Eurasianet.

In the country of Georgia, residents protested in the streets on the first day of the invasion, but in a more cautious move, Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili refused to join other countries in imposing sanctions on Russia, Al Jazeera reported.

When the United Nations General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from membership in the U.N. Human Rights Council earlier this month, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan were among the 24 countries that voted against the move.

Still, aside from Belarus, none of the other former Soviet Union republics have endorsed Russia's war in Ukraine, at least publicly, presenting a potential issue that could prevent them from joining the Union State.

20220505,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon says the majority of Russian forces that had been around the port city of Mariupol have left and headed north, leaving roughly the equivalent of two battalion tactical groups there, or about 2,000 troops.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Thursday that even as Russian airstrikes continue to bombard Mariupol, Moscow’s forces are still making only “plodding” and incremental progress as the main fight presses on in the eastern Donbas region.

He said he has seen no change in Russian behavior or momentum as May 9 draws near.

Russia celebrates Victory Day on May 9, the anniversary of the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. There have been suggestions that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to tout a major victory in Ukraine when he makes his address during the traditional military parade on Red Square.

Kirby said the U.S. still assesses that Russia is behind schedule and not making the progress in the Donbas that it expected.

MARIUPOL, Ukraine — A cleanup operation took place in the center of Mariupol even as Ukrainian fighters held out against Russian troops in the city’s pulverized steel plant. The rest of the city is now under Russian control.

Municipal workers, as well as volunteers, were seen Thursday clearing debris near gutted, charred buildings, including the drama theater where hundreds died when the Russian military bombed it in March. Some workers hung a Russian flag on a tall utility pole.

One volunteer, who gave only his first name, Denis, said he was helping restore parks and war monuments so the city could celebrate Victory Day on Monday. Russia celebrates victory over Nazi Germany in World War II on May 9.

KYIV, Ukraine — In his nightly video address Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described a “catastrophic” lack of access to medical services and medicine in areas of the country under Russian occupation.

In those areas, he said almost no treatment was available for those suffering from cancer and where insulin for diabetics was difficult to find or non-existent. He said antibiotics were in short supply.

Zelenskyy also said that during the course of the war, the Russian military has already fired 2,014 missiles on Ukraine, while 2,682 flights of Russian warplanes have been recorded in Ukrainian skies. He said the destroyed or damaged infrastructure includes nearly 400 hospitals and other medical facilities.

WASHINGTON — Former U.S. President George W. Bush says he spoke Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, “the Winston Churchill of our time.”

“I thanked the President for his leadership, his example, and his commitment to liberty, and I saluted the courage of the Ukrainian people,” Bush said in a Twitter post, which included photos of the two men speaking by video link.

“President Zelenskyy assured me that they will not waver in their fight against Putin’s barbarism and thuggery. Americans are inspired by their fortitude and resilience. We will continue to stand with Ukrainians as they stand up for their freedom.”

UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations says a third operation is underway to evacuate civilians from Mariupol’s besieged steel plant and the city, which is surrounded by Russian forces.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that a third evacuation is taking place and U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said its aim is to evacuate more civilians from Mariupol and the sprawling Azovstal steel plant.

Guterres said 101 civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal plant along with 59 more from a neighboring area in the first operation that ended Tuesday. He said that in the second operation, which was completed Wednesday night, more than 320 civilians were evacuated from the city of Mariupol and surrounding areas.

The secretary-general negotiated the agreement for civilian evacuations from besieged areas including Mariupol with the presidents of Russia and Ukraine. Guterres expressed hope that continued cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the two governments “will lead to more humanitarian pauses to allow civilians safe passage from the fighting and aid to reach those in critical need.”

Griffiths told a U.N. pledging conference for Ukraine in Warsaw, Poland, earlier Thursday that a convoy left for Mariupol on Thursday and expects to arrive Friday morning and hopes to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal plant.

KYIV, Ukraine — The regional governor says a missile attack on the city of Kramatorsk in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region injured 25 people and inflicted wide-ranging damage.

In a Telegram post, Pavlo Kyrylenko says 810 apartments in 32 high-rise buildings sustained damage as the result of an air strike Thursday morning. The post featured photos of multiple buildings reduced to rubble.

Kyrylenko added that six private houses, two schools, a kindergarten and a medical institution were also damaged. He said he had not received reports of any fatalities.

KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian army says Russian troops made “unsuccessful” attempts to advance in the eastern Kharkiv and Donetsk regions.

A Facebook post published Thursday afternoon on the official profile of the Ukrainian General Staff says the Russians also continue to launch missile strikes on transport facilities in order to prevent the movement of humanitarian cargo and military-technical assistance.

MOSCOW — The Russian military says its air force has destroyed 45 Ukrainian military facilities in the latest series of strikes.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the targets hit Thursday by the Russian air force included Ukrainian troops and weapons concentrations and an ammunition depot in the eastern Luhansk region.

Konashenkov said the Russian missile units hit a Ukrainian artillery battery at its firing positions near the settlement of Zarozhne, a battery of Uragan multiple rocket launchers near Mykolaiv and four other areas of concentration of military personnel and military hardware. He said the Russian artillery hit 152 Ukrainian troops’ strongholds and 38 artillery firing positions.

Konashenkov’s claims could not be independently confirmed.

BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says the nation’s foreign minister will soon travel to Ukraine on an official visit after the two countries resolved a diplomatic spat Thursday.

The German government had traded barbs with Ukraine’s ambassador in Berlin after Kyiv appeared to snub an offer to visit by Germany’s president.

It was unclear when exactly Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock will visit Kyiv, and whether she would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Speaking after a meeting with Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, Scholz also said Germany is working hard to build new infrastructure for energy imports along its northern coast to help replace gas and oil currently delivered from Russia by pipeline. He said Germany is willing to cooperate closely with those countries that don’t have direct access to seaports.

ROME — The United Nations’ food aid agency is appealing for Black Sea ports in Ukraine to be open again to permit shipping of wheat and corn exports, which many poor nations depend on.

The Rome-based World Food Program noted in its appeal Thursday that before the war launched by Russia, 98% of Ukraine’s grain exports had moved through those ports.

It said in a statement that a month after the war began on Feb. 24, export prices for wheat had risen by 22% and maize by 20% — that’s on top of already steep rises in 2021 and earlier this year.

The U.N. agency says the ports, in Ukraine’s south, which has suffered from heavy shelling, must resume operations “to protect Ukrainian agricultural production and enable exports that are critical to Ukraine’s economy and global food security.” It cited war-ravaged, impoverished Yemen, which imports more than half of its wheat from Ukraine or Russia, and which depends on shipping for its food imports.

JERUSALEM — Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett says he accepted an apology from Russian President Vladimir Putin over controversial remarks about the Holocaust made by Moscow’s top diplomat.

There was no mention of an apology in the Russian statement on the call.

An Israeli statement says the two leaders spoke by phone Thursday and also discussed plans to evacuate civilians from a besieged steel plant in the port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine.

A statement from Bennett’s office says Putin “promised to allow the evacuation of civilians, including wounded civilians, through a U.N. and Red Cross humanitarian corridor.”

Bennett spoke to Putin after a call on Wednesday with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as the Israeli leader appeared to renew his role as a mediator in the conflict.

That role was thrown into doubt earlier this week when Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested Ukraine could have Nazi elements even though Zelenskyy is Jewish, and then suggested Adolf Hitler had “Jewish origins.”

Israelis expressed shock and outrage at the remarks, which appeared to blame the Holocaust on Jews themselves, and the government summoned Russia’s ambassador in protest.

ROME — The Italian government is significantly stepping up its funding to help refugees from Ukraine who arrive in Italy.

Premier Mario Draghi told a high-level donors’ conference, being hosted in Warsaw, Poland, on Thursday by Poland and Sweden, that Italy has already allocated some 500 million euros ($550 million) to help the refugees, but now it has increased that funding to more than 800 million euros.

As of this week, more than 107,000 people, most of them women or children, have fled the war in Ukraine for Italy. In addition to aid already earmarked for Ukraine’s general budget, Italy also plans to lend the war-ravaged country some 200 million euros more, Draghi said.

In addition, Italy has spent some 26 million euros on humanitarian aid such as tents, ambulances and medicine.

KYIV, Ukraine — The mayor of the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk urged local residents Thursday to leave for the countryside over the upcoming Russian Victory Day weekend. A municipal celebration set to take place from Friday to Sunday has also been canceled.

“I ask, if possible, on May 7, 8 and 9, that … all residents of Ivano-Frankivsk not gather in the city, on the lake, in the park and in other public places,” Ruslan Martsinkiv said in a video message posted on his Telegram channel.

He claimed to have received reports that Russia is planning to continue carrying out missile strikes in the region.

Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian authorities in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia announced that a curfew will be in force between Sunday evening and Monday morning. Similar long curfews have been put in place in Ukrainian cities near front lines over security concerns.

KYIV, Ukraine — According to Ukrainian news agencies, a Ukrainian government body began Thursday to develop proposals for a comprehensive postwar reconstruction plan.

The Reforms Office, which operates under the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, was cited as saying a working group mechanism was launched Thursday to “analyze the current situation and develop proposals for the plan for the reconstruction and development of Ukraine.” Earlier that day, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the launch of a “national fundraising platform” called United24.

The moves came as an international donors’ conference was closing in Warsaw, Poland. According to remarks made Thursday by the Polish prime minister, $6.5 billion in humanitarian was raised at the event, attended by prime ministers and ambassadors from Europe and beyond.

BERLIN — German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday in an effort to resolve a diplomatic spat between the two countries.

German government officials, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, had expressed annoyance after Ukraine made clear last month it didn’t want Steinmeier to visit because of his past dealings with Russia. Ukraine’s ambassador in Berlin, in turn, branded Scholz an “offended liverwurst” for saying the incident was “a problem” in the countries’ relations.

Steinmeier’s office said the two presidents “resolved irritations of the past” during their call. Steinmeier expressed his “solidarity, respect and support for the brave fight by the Ukrainian people against the Russian aggressor,” it said.

It was unclear whether Steinmeier, whose position as head of state is largely ceremonial, would visit Kyiv soon. The President of parliament, Baerbel Bas, who is ranked after Steinmeier but before Scholz according to German political protocol, is expected to visit Ukraine on Sunday.

Separately, Scholz pledged at a Ukraine donors conference Thursday to provide the country with more than 600 million euros in additional humanitarian assistance, loans and development aid.

KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian officer leading the defense of the last bulwark of the strategic city of Mariupol has urged the global community to pressure Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians and wounded soldiers.

Heavy fighting raged Thursday at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, as Russian forces attempted to finish off the city’s last-ditch defenders and complete the capture of the strategically vital port.

Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are holed up in the steel mill’s underground bunkers, many of them wounded. Some civilians are with them, too.

Capt. Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of Ukraine’s Azov Regiment, said in a video statement from the steel mill’s bunkers Thursday that the “wounded soldiers are dying in agony due to the lack of proper treatment.”

He urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to help ensure the evacuation of the wounded and civilians still in the bunkers.

Addressing the world community, Palamar denounced the Russians for “refusing to observe any ethical norms and destroying people before the eyes of the world.”

Videos shared online appeared to show the steel mill targeted by intense shelling at dawn Thursday. Data from NASA fire-tracking satellites corresponded to blazes being seen at the plant just after 6 a.m. Thursday.

Russia maintains that its forces are not entering the maze of tunnels at the steel plant, but Palamar said the Russian forces are fighting in the Azovstal mill.

“It’s been the third day that the enemy has broken through to the territory of Azovstal. Fierce bloody combat is ongoing,” said Palamar.

“The defenders of the city (Mariupol) have been fighting alone for 71 days with the overwhelming forces of the enemy and show such endurance and heroism that the country must know what it means to be loyal to the motherland,” Palamar said on the Telegram messaging app.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark – Finland has decided to send more defense equipment to Ukraine, saying the war-torn country has requested assistance from the European Union and NATO member states.

“We will increase the amount of defense materiel assistance that we send to Ukraine,” Finnish Defense Minister Antti Kaikkonen said in a statement.

On Thursday, Finland’s president gave his approval to the Finnish government’s proposal to send more defense hardware.

No details on what types of defense equipment will be sent were released.

Finland, a member of the EU but not of NATO, earlier sent Ukraine bulletproof vests, composite helmets, stretchers, as well as assault rifles, anti-tank weapons and combat ration packages.

MADRID — A judge in Spain on Thursday ordered the provisional release of Anatoly Shariy, a Ukrainian politician-blogger accused of treason in his home country.

Shariy was arrested on Wednesday in the coastal city of Tarragona on an international arrest warrant issued by Ukraine, according to Spain’s National Court. Court documents said Shariy is accused of “high treason and incitement of hatred.”

Shariy, who has reportedly lived in Spain since 2019, was ordered to turn in his passport and remain in the country. The court said officials in Ukraine now have 40 days to formally present a request for Shariy’s extradition.

His arrest was announced by Ukraine’s security services on Thursday, who said there was reason to believe Shariy “was acting on behalf of foreign entities.”

Shariy, the founder of a political party considered by many Ukrainians to be pro-Russian, has been a vocal and active critic of Ukraine’s government.

Ukrainian media reported that one of the members of the party said in February, prior to the start of the war, that Shariy had been granted asylum in the European Union.

WARSAW, Poland — Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki says that $6.5 billion has been raised at an international donors’ conference in Warsaw to provide humanitarian help for war-torn Ukraine.

The conference on Thursday was co-hosted by Poland and Sweden and attended by prime ministers and ambassadors representing many European countries, as well as countries further afield and some businesses.

Much of the world has responded to the war in Ukraine with an outpouring of humanitarian support. But as the war drags on for weeks, the humanitarian needs in Ukraine have grown more acute. In addition to the thousands killed, millions of people have been displaced, and there are increasing reports of people being tortured and raped.

VILNIUS, Lithuania — A 500-million-euro ($530 million) Lithuanian-Polish natural gas transmission pipeline was inaugurated Thursday, completing another stage of regional independence from Russian energy sources.

The Gas Interconnection Poland-Lithuania pipeline that runs more than 500 kilometers (310 miles), comes “at a time when Russia has once again tried to blackmail us using gas,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the inauguration.

Lithuania’s Prime Minister Ingridas Simonyte added that “any reduction or disappearance of this source of funding would have a very significant impact on the Russian economy and the ability to continue financing the war in Ukraine.”

The Lithuania-Poland leg is integrated with pipelines in the other two Baltic states — Estonia and Latvia — and Finland, and into the European Union gas transmission system. Before the pipeline was built, the four countries could only receive pipeline gas from Russia.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s government has launched a global fundraising platform so individuals can donate to help rebuild Ukraine, offer humanitarian aid, and raise money for demining.

The United States and Europe, among others, have offered billions of dollars in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden asked Congress for $33 billion to bolster Ukraine’s fight against Russia.

Ukraine’s newest fundraising drive is intended to give individuals a way to donate on their own with a single click, Zelenskyy said.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said Thursday that Russia has decided to expel four diplomats with Denmark’s Embassy in Moscow.

“They have wrongfully become pieces in Putin’s cynical power play,” Kofod said. “It is a completely unjustified and deeply problematic decision, which underscores that Russia no longer wants real dialogue and diplomacy.”

Moscow said seven Danish diplomats were expelled. Danish media said that those expelled included four diplomats and three others without diplomatic status. They must leave within two weeks.

Moscow’s tit-for-tat decision came after Denmark last month expelled 15 Russian intelligence officers who worked at Russia’s Embassy in Copenhagen. Several other European countries also expelled Russian intelligence officers.

SOFIA, Bulgaria — In anticipation of a European Union embargo on Russian crude oil Bulgaria says it’s looking for an exemption due to its dependence on supplies from Russia.

Bulgaria’s only oil refinery near the Black Sea port of Burgas is owned by Russia’s oil giant LUKOIL and is the main fuel supplier in the country.

Still, Deputy Prime Minister Assen Vassilev told reporters that the refinery is already processing up to 50% non-Russian crude and theoretically should be able to fully eliminate Russian crude.

“Bulgaria, technologically, can do without Russian crude oil, but this would significantly increase fuel prices,” Vassilev said. “In case the European Commission weighs some exemptions, we would like to take advantage of it, because it will be in the best interest of Bulgarian consumers.”

Slovakia and Hungary have already asked for such exemptions.

Russia stopped gas deliveries to Bulgaria last week in response to Sofia’s refusal to pay for it in rubles saying it violates existing contracts.

20220510,"ALEPPO, Syria/UNITED NATIONS, Brussels – “Life quickly became an open-air prison after the war,” a young woman from Aleppo told UNFPA. “We were instructed not to leave our houses for fear of harassment, rape and kidnap. I was told that child marriage was my only path to true safety.”

More than a decade of grinding conflict, mass displacement, economic devastation, multiple droughts, and an unrelenting pandemic are fuelling catastrophic humanitarian needs in Syria. Some 7.3 million women and girls need critical sexual and reproductive health services and support for gender-based violence, as vulnerabilities to multiple forms of physical and sexual violence and child marriage continue to soar.

Many women and girls report abuse to be so widespread and unchecked, it has become normalized as a reality of daily life. For some, it is all they have ever known. “Violence against women and girls has become so common after the crisis,” explained Shaza, an adolescent girl from Qamishli in northeast Syria. “Many women in my family are struggling and cannot find the right support. I see more women being beaten by men in their families, and sometimes in public.”

In 2022, an estimated 26.5 million people are in need due to the crisis: 14.6 million people inside Syria and approximately 12 million across the region, including 5.6 million Syrian refugees and host community members. The crisis is taking a particularly heavy toll on women and girls. Severe funding shortfalls, ongoing hostilities and fuel shortages are disrupting the delivery of essential services – with a direct impact on their health, safety and lives.

Meanwhile the United Nations World Food Programme reports that the cost of basic food such as rice and bread have reached their highest levels since recording started, and could be pushed even higher by the war in Ukraine. Nine out of ten people in Syria now live below the poverty line, and when food is scarce it is often women and girls who eat last and least, leading to alarming levels of malnutrition among children and pregnant and lactating women.

On 9 and 10 May, the European Union held its 6th Brussels Conference on Syria, the main pledging event for the country and the region in 2022. While political attention is diverted to newer conflicts unfolding around the world, millions of Syrians in crisis are in danger of being forgotten.

“The situation is worse now than ever for women and girls,” said Dr. Luay Shabaneh, UNFPA’s Regional Director in the Arab States. “We must step up efforts and work together to ensure that women and girls’ rights to give birth safely and live free from violence are protected, and that they can actively participate in finding a sustainable path forward.”

UNICEF estimates that more than 3 million children from Syria are no longer in school, leaving them at heightened risk of forced marriage and child labour. This means an entire generation could lose their educational future, and with it any chance of successfully joining the workforce as adults. The situation is even more dire in displacement camps and other settlements, where more than half of the children are not in school.

Ayoush told UNFPA that she usually spends her days working in the field from dawn before returning home to take care of her children. She said she was grateful for the UNFPA-supported reproductive health clinic in her village of Arran village, in rural Aleppo, where she and her children were looked after by trained medical staff. © UNFPA Syria

Betul is 12 years old and recently moved with her family from Syria to Türkiye, where she was able to attend a UNFPA-supported youth centre. She described the support she received there as life-altering: “I don’t want to get married. I want to study, and the centre helped make that a reality.” Betul also started receiving psychosocial support at the centre to respond to her family’s pressure to get married. “I talked to the psychologist and explained my situation. They guided me on how to talk with my family, and I followed their advice. I’m in school now and hope to go to university next.”

Throughout the region, UNFPA is supporting 79 women and girls’ safe spaces, 15 youth centres, 26 emergency obstetric care facilities, 119 primary health-care centres and 94 mobile clinics. UNFPA and its partners remain committed to providing life-saving services to women and girls in Syria and in camps and host communities across the region.

An estimated 70 per cent of the population cannot meet their basic needs, yet at the end of 2021 the humanitarian response for Syria was less than 50 per cent funded – the lowest levels seen in six years. UNFPA is appealing for $145.2 million in 2022 to continue its life-saving work inside Syria and the five neighbouring countries hosting the majority of Syrian refugees – Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Türkiye.

Over the past five years, UNFPA has ramped up its regional response to the crisis, doubling the number of people reached since its onset in 2011. In 2021 alone, more than 1.1 million women received sexual and reproductive health services and some 600,000 were supported with gender-based violence response and protection, including 200,000 adolescent girls. Around 150,000 women were provided with cash assistance."
20220510,"The European Union while condemning the attack on peaceful protesters, yesterday called on the authorities to initiate an investigation into the events and to hold accountable those instigating or perpetrating violence. “The EU and its 27 Member States are monitoring closely developments in Sri Lanka,” a statement issued by the EU said.

“The EU condemns the recent vicious attack against peaceful protesters in Colombo, which triggered further violence after a month of peaceful demonstrations had shown, despite some isolated incidents, that Sri Lankans are able to exercise peacefully their right to freedom of expression”

The EU deplores the loss of life, including of a Member of Parliament, and the high number of injured people. The EU calls on the authorities to initiate an investigation into the events and to hold accountable those instigating or perpetrating violence. The EU urges all parties to refrain from violence and to show restraint. The EU recalls the importance to safeguard the democratic rights of all citizens, and to focus on solutions that will address the significant challenges currently faced by the Sri Lankans.

Over the last few months the EU has provided humanitarian assistance, including for handling the COVID crisis and the ensuing challenges, and is actively looking at ways to further mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the most vulnerable people."

Credit Suisse, together with its subsidiaries, provides various financial services in Switzerland, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and Asia Pacific. The Company offers private banking and wealth management solutions, including advisory, investment, financial planning, succession planning, and trust services, and financing and lending, and multi-shore platform solutions.

Credit Suisse has a history of business dealings with Russian oligarchs, or ultra-high net worth business leaders possessing significant political influence. For example, an article published by Financial Times on February 7, 2022, entitled ""Credit Suisse securitizes yacht loans to oligarchs and tycoons"", cited a recent investor presentation for a synthetic securitization deal, in which Credit Suisse sold off $80 million worth of risk related to a $2 billion portfolio of loans backed by assets owned by certain of the bank's ultra-high net worth clients (the ""Securitization Deal""), which disclosed that, in 2017 and 2018, Credit Suisse experienced 12 defaults on yacht and aircraft loans, a third of which were related to U.S. sanctions against Russian oligarchs. Press reports at the time indicated that Russian billionaires Oleg Deripaska, Arkady Rotenberg, and Boris Rotenberg had to terminate private jet leases with Credit Suisse in those years.

Beginning in or around October 2021, Russia commenced a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border, in apparent preparation for an invasion of Ukraine. Although the Russian government repeatedly denied it had plans to invade or attack Ukraine, the U.S. later released intelligence of Russian invasion plans, including satellite photographs showing Russian troops and equipment near the Russo-Ukrainian border.

In November 2021, as Russia's military buildup on the Russo-Ukrainian border continued, the Company entered the Securitization Deal.

Just months later, on February 24, 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion, Western governments including, among others, the U.S., Canada, and the European Union, imposed significant sanctions on Russia. The sanctions included, inter alia, measures targeting Russia's ultrawealthy oligarchs by denying them access to the global financial system and by, in some cases, authorizing the seizure of certain of their high-value assets located outside of Russia.

Barely a week after the commencement of the Russian invasion and the retaliatory sanctions imposed by Western nations, news outlets reported that Credit Suisse had requested non-participating investors who received information about the Company's loan portfolio to destroy and permanently erase any confidential information that Credit Suisse provided to them regarding the Securitization Deal.

The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Credit Suisse had deficient disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (ii) Credit Suisse's practice of lending money to Russian oligarchs subject to U.S. and international sanctions created a significant risk of violating rules pertaining to those sanctions and future sanctions; (iii) the foregoing conduct subjected the Company to an increased risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny and/or enforcement actions; (iv) the Securitization Deal concerned loans that Credit Suisse made to Russian oligarchs previously sanctioned by the U.S.; (v) the purpose of the Securitization Deal was to offload the risks associated with these loans and mitigate the impact on Credit Suisse of sanctions likely to be implemented by Western nations in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine; (vi) Credit Suisse's request that non-participating investors destroy documents related to the Securitization Deal was intended to conceal the Company's noncompliance with U.S. and international sanctions in its lending practices; (vii) the foregoing, once revealed, was likely to subject the Company to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and significant reputational harm; and (viii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On March 28, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform sent Credit Suisse a letter asking the Company to turn over information and documents about a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets owned by clients, potentially including sanctioned Russian individuals. In the letter, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney and Rep. Stephen Lynch, chair of the Subcommittee on National Security, questioned Credit Suisse's request that hedge funds and other non-participating investors ""destroy documents"" related to yachts and private jets owned by the bank's clients. ""Given the timing of this request and its subject matter,"" the House Democrats wrote, ""Credit Suisse's action raises significant concerns that it may be concealing information"" about whether participants in the deal may be ""evading sanctions"" imposed by the West after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

On this news, Credit Suisse's stock price fell $0.21 per share, or 2.58%, to close at $7.94 per share on March 28, 2022.

20220511,"The Chief Minister Fabian Picardo and the Deputy Chief Minister Dr Joseph Garcia this afternoon met the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss together with UK Minister for Europe James Cleverly.

Mr Picardo and the Foreign Secretary discussed the latest developments in relation to the ongoing negotiations on the future relationship of Gibraltar with the European Union.

In addition to this, the ability of UK nationals who hold blue civilian registration cards to cross the border was also raised.

It was agreed that the objective of the two Governments is to convene a formal meeting of the Joint Ministerial Council in the coming weeks.

The Chief Minister and the Foreign Secretary last met in March.

The Chief Minister, the Hon Fabian Picardo, said: “It was as much a pleasure as it was useful to see Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Minister for Europe James Cleverly with the Deputy Chief Minister, Joseph Garcia. We all continue to be strongly optimistic that we will be able to conclude a safe and secure agreement between the UK and the EU in relation to Gibraltar for the benefit of all parties, in particular the people of Gibraltar and of the region. The positive tenor of the current round of the negotiations this week confirms my own view in this respect.”"
20220513,"The Forum on Forests concluded its seventeenth session today, approving its omnibus resolution and a draft decision that its eighteenth session will be held at United Nations Headquarters from 8 to 12 May 2023, sending both texts to the Economic and Social Council for formal adoption.

The European Union, speaking in its observer capacity, celebrated the omnibus resolution as a “great achievement” for international cooperation. Stressing that forests play a major role in mitigating climate change and biodiversity loss, as well as in providing social and environmental benefits, she said they also represent important cultural heritage for indigenous peoples. “This resolution reflects well these stakes,” she said, noting nonetheless that the bloc would like to have seen stronger language in some provisions. Condemning in the strongest terms the Russian Federation’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, she highlighted the critical importance of protecting the environment during armed conflict.

The United States representative, in explanation of position on paragraph 14, underscored that trade language negotiated or adopted by the General Assembly or the Economic and Social Council has no relevance for his country’s trade policy or the agenda of the World Trade Organization (WTO), an entity that has different roles, rules and membership than the United Nations.

Approval of the omnibus resolution (document E/CN.18/2022/L.4) and the decision (document E/CN.18/2022/L.2) capped a week of discussions on achieving the global forest goals and targets of the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030: reversing forest cover loss, enhancing forest-based benefits, significantly increasing protected forest area, mobilizing new and additional financial resources, promoting governance frameworks and enhancing cooperation for sustainable forest management. Throughout the session, delegates underscored the importance of providing guidance and inputs to the Council’s tenth high-level political forum on sustainable development in July.

Also today, the Forum approved its provisional agenda for its eighteenth session (document E/CN.18/2022/L.3) and the draft report of its seventeenth session (document E/CN.18/2022/L.1), introduced by Rapporteur Javad Momeni (Iran).

In closing remarks, Juliette Biao, Director of the Forum Secretariat, said she was amazed by the enthusiasm, dedication and commitment of Member States and all stakeholders for their engagement in the discussions, especially those who joined virtually. “We now have a clear road map and guidance on what we need to do in the next two years,” she said. The Secretariat carefully listened to all views and concerns and is committed to working with all involved to implement the omnibus resolution.

Forum Chair Miriam MacIntosh (Suriname) similarly thanked delegates for their flexibility and constructive discussions, emphasizing: “We look forward to further implementation of the omnibus resolution.”

Immediately following the meeting’s conclusion, the Forum opened its eighteenth session, electing by acclamation Zéphyrin Maniratanga (Burundi) as Chair of its eighteenth and nineteenth sessions, to be held in 2023 and 2024, respectively, as well as Javad Momeni (Iran) and Ismail Belen (Turkey) as Vice-Chairs."

20220516,"Greg had a look at the oil techs here in his post:

ANZ had a bit of a summary of the drivers, this in brief from a longer piece. Monday data from China sent the price a little lower, but optimism over Shnaghai reopening soon returned:
• Crude oil prices were under pressure earlier in the session after data revealed the extent of the impact of China’s lockdowns on economic activity. Industrial output and consumer spending slumped in April to the worst levels since the pandemic began. This has resulted in apparent oil demand falling 6.7% m/m to 12.09mb/d in April, based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics. However, there may be some relief from the lockdowns, with Shanghai recording its second day of no COVID-19 cases outside of quarantine.

On supply (and other) issues helping underpin price:
• Crude oil prices rallied later in the session amid tightness in refined products ahead of the key demand period. US gasoline futures pushed above USD4/gallon for the first time ever as robust demand and constraints on refining capacity pushed inventories lower. European Union foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss the next round of Russian sanctions. A proposed ban on oil imports has been delayed, as Hungary sticks to demands for an extended phase-out period.

20220530,"Russian troops pushed deeper into a key eastern Ukrainian city Monday, fighting street by street with Kyiv's forces in a battle that has left Sievierodonetsk in ruins. In a bid to pressure Moscow to end the war, the European Union agreed to embargo most Russian oil imports by the end of the year.

As Moscow's advance on Sievierodonetsk increased in intensity, Russian forces also shelled parts of Ukraine's northeast, and a struggle continued for control of a southern region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Russia has prevented the export of 22 million tons of Ukrainian grain, contributing to a growing global food crisis.

Military analysts described the fight for Sievierodonetsk as part of a race against time for the Kremlin. The city is important to Russian efforts to quickly complete the capture of the eastern industrial region of the Donbas before more Western arms arrive to bolster Ukraine’s defense. Moscow-backed separatists already held territory in the region and have been fighting Ukrainian troops for eight years.

“The Kremlin has reckoned that it can’t afford to waste time and should use the last chance to extend the separatist-controlled territory because the arrival of Western weapons in Ukraine could make it impossible,"" Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said.

In a potential setback for Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden appeared to dismiss reports that the U.S. was considering sending long-range rocket systems to the country.

But the European Union approved additional sanctions on Russia. As part of a long-delayed financial support package to help Ukraine, EU leaders agreed Monday to embargo most Russian oil imports into the 27-nation bloc by year-end. The agreement came after Zelenskyy asked the EU to target Russian oil exports so Moscow “feels the price for what it is doing against Ukraine.”

The embargo covers Russian oil brought in by sea, allowing a temporary exemption for imports delivered by pipeline. EU Council President Charles Michel said the agreement covers more than two-thirds of oil imports from Russia. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU’s executive branch, said the move will “effectively cut around 90% of oil imports from Russia to the EU by the end of the year.”

In an effort to punish and divide the West over its support for Ukraine, Russia has cut off natural gas to a handful of European countries. In its latest move, Russian state gas giant Gazrpom said it will halt gas supplies to Dutch gas trader GasTerra starting Tuesday.

Russia also ramped up its actions on the battlefield. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said the situation in the Donbas remains “extremely difficult” as Russia has put its army’s “maximum combat power” there.

The Ukrainian military said Russian forces reinforced their positions outside Sievierodonetsk, a city 145 kilometers (90 miles) south of the Russian border in an area that is the last pocket of Ukrainian government control in Luhansk.

Sievierodonetsk Mayor Oleksandr Striuk said the city has been “completely ruined.” Artillery fire has destroyed critical infrastructure and damaged 90% of the buildings, and power and communications have been largely cut to a city that was once home to 100,000 people, he said.

“The number of victims is rising every hour, but we are unable to count the dead and the wounded amid the street fighting,” Striuk told The Associated Press in a phone interview, adding that Moscow’s troops advanced a few more blocks toward the city center.

He said that only about 12,000 to 13,000 residents remain, sheltering in basements and bunkers to escape the Russian bombardment. The situation recalls the siege of Mariupol, which trapped residents and led to some of the worst suffering of the war. More than 20,000 are feared dead in Mariupol.

Striuk estimated that 1,500 civilians have died in Sievierodonetsk since the war began from Russian attacks and from dire conditions that include a lack of medicine and medical treatment.

A 32-year-old French journalist, Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, died Monday near Sievierodonetsk when he was hit by shrapnel from shelling while covering Ukrainian evacuations, according to his employer, French broadcaster BFM TV.

Zelenskyy said Leclerc-Imhoff was the 32nd media worker to die in Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.

Governors of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions — which make up the Donbas — said six civilians, including the journalist, were killed in shelling. Authorities in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, also reported one person died in shelling there.

Zelenskyy said Russian troops also shelled the Sumy region near the Russian border, and the struggle continued for the southern Kherson region, which has been largely controlled by Russian troops since the early days of the war. Russia-installed officials there said they would ask the Kremlin to annex it, while Kyiv, in turn, has vowed to liberate the region.

The Russian advance in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk on either side of the strategically important Siverskiy Donetsk River is part of an all-out push, said Zhdanov, the Ukrainian military analyst. He said the intensity of the latest fighting and the influx of Russian troops have surprised Ukrainians, who are trying to hold out until more weapons arrive.

On Monday, Biden told reporters that there are no plans for the United States to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine, amid reports that the move is being considered.

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, called it a “reasonable” decision. He said that “otherwise, if our cities come under attack, the Russian armed forces would fulfill their threat and strike the centers where such criminal decisions are made.”

Medvedev added that “some of them aren’t in Kyiv.”

In the Kherson region, the Russia-installed deputy head of the regional administration, Kirill Stremousov, told Russia’s Tass state news agency that grain from last year’s harvest is being delivered to Russian buyers, adding that “obviously there is a lot of grain here.”

Russia has pressed the West to lift sanctions against it as it seeks to shift the blame for the growing food crisis, which has led to skyrocketing prices in Africa.

Zelenskyy accused Moscow of “deliberately creating this problem” and said Russia’s claim that sanctions are to blame is a lie. He said sanctions haven’t blocked Russian food, and he accused Russia of stealing at least a half million tons of Ukrainian grain.

20220604,"Poland, one of the countries that have supported Ukraine steadfastly throughout the Russian invasion, will donate 18 AHS KRAB self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine. The agreement was reportedly signed by Poland and Ukraine last May 31.

Ukraine, which had been experiencing heavy shelling from Russia, has repeatedly pleaded for more long-range rocket systems and artillery to push back the Russian forces, especially with the fighting now getting intensified in eastern Ukraine.

After the news broke out, it was also announced that Ukraine would buy more of these KRAB howitzers from Poland. According to Radio Poland, the Polish Government will sell 60 (some say 54) KRAB self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, worth some $700,000 (€650 million). The deal is reportedly Poland’s biggest export arms deal in years.

The Polish military has reportedly begun conducting training for some 100 Ukrainian soldiers to use the weapons proficiently.

This comes after Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki visited Kyiv last Wednesday. This was confirmed by Polish Government Spokesman Piotr Muller.

“Today, Polish-Ukrainian 🇵🇱🇺🇦 intergovernmental consultations will take place in Kiev. Poland is the first country since Russia’s February invasion to meet the Ukrainian government in this formula.” Muller said in a tweet.

During this visit, the two governments had signed a number of memorandums on cooperation, including further cooperation on defense activities, economic cooperation, supporting Polish companies in the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war, and policies regarding energy, food, and transportation.

“Perhaps these documents will pave the way for a new Polish-Ukrainian treaty that we’ll be discussing in the coming weeks and months,” Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki said.

“I believe that Moscow is increasingly terrified of Polish-Ukrainian relations – of the way they are growing,” he added. The Polish Prime Minister also vowed to Ukraine that it would do everything to convince the European Union to let them have candidate status.

“If it was up to us, Ukraine would enter the EU very quickly,” he said.

SOFREP reported early last March that Ukraine had formally applied to the European Union and asked to be urgently admitted into the organization through a new and special procedure.

“We appeal to the European Union for Ukraine’s immediate accession under a new special procedure. We are grateful to partners for being with us. But our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal to. I am confident that it is fair. I am confident have we deserved it. I am confident that all this is possible,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last March.

“Do prove that you are with us. Do prove that you will not let us go. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans, and then life will win over death, and light will win over darkness,” he said to the European Union in a speech.

However, European Union membership is complex and intricate. Thus, it is not expected that Ukraine will be admitted as a member anytime soon. The country needs to satisfy certain conditions such as being a stable democracy, a free-market economy, adopting EU laws, and adopting the Euro. Ukraine needs to prove that it can compete in the EU before being admitted. Despite this, countries such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Poland have all expressed their endorsement for immediate accession.

What Can the KRAB Howitzers Bring To The Table?

The KRAB Howitzer is a uniquely Polish weapon designed by Poland, with several of its main parts being shipped from other places. It’s a 155mm NATO-compatible self-propelled howitzer made with the South Korean K9 Thunder chassis, with a British AS-90M Braveheart turret, equipped with WB Electronics’ Topaz artillery fire control system.

Its 2011 variant uses a Nexter Systems barrel with a UPG chassis. Furthermore, the 2016 batch utilizes the K9 chassis once again but with a Rheinmetall barrel. This makes it a product of Poland, South Korea, and the United Kingdom initially, with input from the French and the Germans.

As stated earlier, its main armament is a 155mm 52 caliber gun, with an automated loading system capable of firing three rounds in less than 10 seconds. The howitzer is known to have 25 miles (40km) range. It is also equipped with an NBC protection system, an automatic fire impression system, and a laser range-finder. It can carry a total of 40 shells and 48 charges, with 29 rounds in the turret and 11 in the chassis. It is also fitted with a 12.7 mm machine gun and 4 81mm smoke grenade discharger on each side.

Poland has thus far donated an unknown number of T-72 tanks (some reports say 250), 2S1 Goździk self-propelled howitzers, Grad rocket launches, and air-to-air missiles for MiG-29s and Su-27 fighter jets."

20220607,"Australian consumers’ choices on websites and apps are being manipulated through online designs taking advantage of their weaknesses. That’s according to research on consumers’ online experiences and the presentation of websites and apps, released today by the Consumer Policy Research Centre (CPRC).

The research gives examples of consumers being manipulated or deceived into unintentionally buying items, paying more, or giving up more personal data than they meant to.

Examples include situations where an online store automatically added items to consumers’ carts, and “Hotel California” techniques which make it easy to subscribe to a service, but much harder to unsubscribe.

According to the CPRC’s findings, 83% of Australians surveyed had experienced one or more negative consequences – including financial harm or feeling manipulated – as a result of these “dark patterns”.

Some misleading designs breach the Australian Consumer Law. However, not all designs that have unfair consequences will necessarily be captured under the law. The latest report adds to existing calls to amend consumer law by introducing a ban on unfair trading practices.

Experts and regulators around the world have highlighted concerning online design techniques in recent years, labelling them “dark patterns” or “deceptive design”.

These designs often take advantage of a consumer’s recognised behavioural biases. For instance, “default bias” is consumers’ bias in favour of leaving default choices in place to avoid making complex decisions. Businesses take advantage of this by pre-ticking boxes in favour of the business’s preferences, despite consumer interests.

The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission has examined dark patterns, defining them as:

The CPRC study conducted a randomised sweep of websites and apps to identify deceptive design features.

The CPRC found several examples of online stores automatically adding items to consumers’ shopping carts, such as insurance or service plans.

For example, in one case a consumer buying a washing machine from a major online retailer for A$1,059, may or may not have noticed a single-line item, “3 Year Care Plan For Home - $160”, in the final steps of their purchase.

In other cases, customers were presented with offers of a product care plan at several points in the checkout process. The CPRC says:

For products sold in Australia, consumer guarantees about the quality of products are provided free of charge under the Australian Consumer Law.

Another concerningly common pattern is the relative difficulty consumers experience when trying to unsubscribe from a service, compared with how easy it is to sign up. CPRC labels this “Hotel California”, after the famous line in the Eagles’ song: “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave”.

Examples from the CPRC’s findings included attempting to cancel an Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, which required a consumer to navigate more than five screens. Similarly, cancelling an eBay Plus subscription required four additional steps after selecting “cancel membership”.

The CPRC argues it should be as easy to opt-out of a service as it is to opt-in. While extra steps may not seem disastrous in isolation, they can especially disadvantage those already experiencing vulnerabilities, such as sudden illness, loss of a loved one, or low digital literacy.

This is sometimes combined with another manipulative design technique called “confirmshaming”. With this, consumers are asked to confirm a statement that makes them feel shamed or foolish, such as if they want to “lose their benefits” or if they “refuse to support” a good cause.

The CPRC also found the majority of consumers surveyed (89%) had experienced being asked for more personal information than was needed to access the relevant product or service. This was achieved in various ways, including by:
• forcing the consumer to create a profile to browse or purchase a product, and
• treating the mere use of a website as acceptance of data terms or conditions.

Other examples of manipulative design included highlighting the business’s preference in a colour known to entice consumers to agree or act (often green or blue), using a rapid countdown to create a false sense of urgency, and warning that a number of other customers are looking at a product.

Importantly, the research found consumers aged between 18 and 28 were more likely to suffer negative impacts from manipulative design, leading to substantial effects on their financial well-being and privacy. A significant proportion of consumers in this younger age bracket reported they:
• spent more than they intended (33%)
• disclosed more personal information than they wanted to (27%)
• created an online account when they didn’t want to (37%), and
• accidentally signed up to something (39%).

We need to upgrade business practices and consumer law

For businesses, using dark patterns to boost profit will likely lead to long-term losses in the form of consumer trust and loyalty. Almost one in three people surveyed said they stopped using a website or app (either temporarily or permanently) after experiencing dark patterns.

Misleading designs may also lead to penalties for businesses under the Australian Consumer Law. This happened last year when Google’s privacy settings were found likely to mislead consumers.

However, other designs that have unfair consequences might not fall foul of consumer laws, if they don’t meet certain criteria set out by the law.

The CPRC’s research adds to evidence in support of the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission’s existing recommendation that our consumer law should include an unfair practices prohibition, similar to those in the European Union and the United Kingdom."

20220617,"You can't keep a good stock down, and judging by its performance Friday Meta Platforms (META 3.38%) is considered a good stock by the investing world. Shares of the social media bellwether inched up by nearly 2% that day, despite a bearish new note from an analyst and a potentially challenging development on the regulatory front.

With the S&P 500 index rising incrementally on Friday after being absolutely hammered in previous sessions, a trickle of optimism returned to the exchanges. Investors were less shy to snap up shares of sector leaders, and Meta is the meta-stock of the social media world.

A potentially higher rise might have been curbed by negative developments. That morning, Bank of America analyst Justin Post trimmed his price targets on several top tech sector names, including Meta, on fears of potentially slowing macroeconomic growth affecting ad spending.

For Meta, this is shaking out to a $1.63 per-share cut to Post's estimate for 2023 per-share earnings, to $12.05. He now feels that the stock is worth $200 per share, down from the former $262.

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ocean, a top European Union (EU) regulatory official suggested that privacy cases concerning major tech companies should be adjudicated differently. Wojciech Wiewiorowski, the economic bloc's data protection supervisor, said it would be better if the powerful EU itself was responsible rather than national agencies.

Meta is certainly vulnerable to wider macroeconomic developments, since a slowing economy tends to reduce those all-important advertising budgets it's so dependent upon. European privacy regulation has been relatively effective, but there remain calls to be even tougher on tech giants; we'll have to watch that space to see how the situation develops.

Regardless of how either dynamic plays out, though, Meta's Facebook is sure to remain the king of the social media hill, and an unavoidable destination for major advertisers."
20220617,"The European Union's executive arm on Friday recommended putting Ukraine on a path to membership. This comes as the U.S. and Europe pledged earlier this week to support Ukraine militarily. Jeremy Shapiro, research director of the European Council on Foreign Relations who was on the State Department's policy planning staff during the Obama administration, joins John Yang to discuss.
• In the southern port city of Mykolaiv, another residential building crushed by Russian shelling. After nearly four months of war, destruction and death seems endless, in the east cities, strewn with rubble. A Russian rocket hit this bomb shelter in Lysychansk, once a cultural center where 40 people took refuge. At least four of them were killed. Shell-shocked residents are hanging by a thread.
• The twin city of nearby Severodonetsk has been besieged for weeks. On Russian state TV, Moscow showed off his handiwork at the Azot chemical plant where hundreds of civilians shelter underground. Severodonetsk remains the focus of fighting in Eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces aim to capture the entire Donbas region. Ukrainian officials say hundreds of their soldiers are killed each day. But, in Kyiv today, a show of support. In his second surprise visit, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson offered to train up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers every 120 days.
• For more on these developments and Russia's four-month-long invasion of Ukraine, we're joined by Jeremy Shapiro, research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations. He was on the State Department's policy planning staff during the Obama administration. Mr. Shapiro, thanks so much for joining us. What's the significance, the European Union beginning the process of E.U. membership for Ukraine? What's the significance of that? Jeremy Shapiro, Research Director, European Council on Foreign Relations: At the moment, the significance is mostly symbolic. It shows a great deal of solidarity with Ukraine. And it's a message that the Europeans are sending to both Russia and Ukraine that they are with Ukraine and that they are going to do their utmost to support them. But it's a long term process. And it probably won't make any immediate difference on the battlefield in any way.
• I'm not sure I'd go so far as that it dispelled that, but, certainly, there was no hint of that in the visit. In no way shape or form that they signal that they were pressuring the Ukrainians in any way to settle this war, which is a little bit, as you point out, at variance with some of the hints that President Macron of France and Chancellor Scholz of Germany have given in the past.
• There is some level of negotiation going on? As I understand it, there is there is some contact between the Ukrainian and Russian side. But I wouldn't say that there's any real negotiations going on. There was some effort at that in March, but, really, nothing has progressed since then. I think that sort of scale of the Russian atrocities that has been demonstrated since then have made it very difficult for the Ukrainians or anyone else to negotiate with the Russians. And so there's really very little happening. And there's massive disagreements in any case on what that settlement would look like. But, at the same time, I think we need to understand that nobody knows how to get out of this war except through a negotiated settlement.
• President Biden likes to say that the support is unlimited, but that doesn't really make a lot of sense. Obviously, the United States is not the same as Ukraine, and even if the United States is clearly in Ukraine's camp, it's not going to be willing to expand all of its efforts for Ukraine. Their interests are not distinct. And I think that the United States has had a lot of trouble sort of signaling to the Ukrainians that, while their support is real, while their support is meaningful — they have given, after all, well over $50 billion in assistance at this point, or at least promised — that their support is not unlimited, and that Ukrainians also need to be thinking about how to get out of this war. But that hasn't really — that is not a message, I think, that has come across as yet.
• Well, the United States has outlined that the goal of the war is to protect Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. They have further pointed out that they are not going to force the Ukrainians into any settlement. And I think that they mean that. But, as I said, the degree of U.S. assistance gives them the right to express an opinion on what the contours of that settlement might be. And I think what they would want to be thinking about is, first of all, a status for Ukraine. The Ukrainians floated a neutrality status to the Russians in March. They would also want to be thinking about security guarantees that could be provided to the Ukrainians by the United States, by other Western allies, and perhaps by Russia, in order to guarantee that neutrality and to guarantee Ukrainian territorial integrity. And then, in the most difficult — the most difficult area of all, I think that the — that the that they would want to be thinking about how to resolve the territories that are being occupied by Russia. There is absolutely no agreement on that front at all. And I think it's very difficult to understand even what the U.S. could ask of the Ukrainians. It would be quite difficult to ask them to give up territory that is — that rightfully belongs to Ukraine. But one could at least imagine a formula that, while not in any way giving up Ukrainian claims, at least puts those territories into — to the side and allows them to have some sort of cease-fire, where they can then negotiate the final status of those territories. It's important to emphasize that we're very far from that right now. And the U.S. is not asking the Ukrainians to do that and may never do so. But, ultimately, if the war wants to get — if we want to solve the war through a negotiation, we are going to have to at least start to look at those issues, even though many people think that it is wrong to even talk about them."
20220623,"Leaders of the European Union on Thursday decided to make Ukraine and Moldova official candidates for membership of the bloc, reported DW, quoting news agencies AP, AFP and dpa.

European Council President Charles Michel made the announcement after discussions among leaders of the EU's 27 member states.

The EU has been largely united in backing Ukraine since Russia invaded on February 24, adopting unprecedented economic sanctions against Moscow. Just four days after Russia launched its war, Ukraine applied to become a member of the EU.

Member states were initially divided on how quickly the bloc should accept Ukraine as a member, with the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark among the most skeptical.

But Ukraine's bid got a boost last week when the European Commission gave its endorsement based on Kyiv's answers to a questionnaire.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed the decision, calling it ""a unique and historic moment"" in relations with the 27-nation bloc.

""Ukraine's future is in the EU,"" he tweeted.

Moldovan President Maia Sandu tweeted that the decision was a ""strong signal of support for Moldova and our citizens.""

What EU leaders have said

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tweeted his congratulations to the two countries.

""The European Council welcomes two new candidate countries to join the EU,"" said Scholz. ""Here's to good cooperation in the European family.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was convinced that Ukraine and Moldova would move as swiftly as possible to implement necessary reforms.

""I am deeply convinced that our decision that we have taken today strengthens us all,"" she said.

European Council President Charles Michel tweeted that it had been a ""historic moment.""

Today marks a crucial step on your path towards the EU,"" he told both countries.

Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told DW the European Union had a window of opportunity to convince Ukraine and Moldova to implement reforms required for European Union accession.

""If you lose this opportunity window because you don't give hope, then Ukraine and Moldova do not do the reforms that also we need. Getting rid of corruption, also being a rule of law country,"" she said.

""Today the EU is sending a message of solidarity to the people of Ukraine that you belong to the European family, that you belong to the EU... and you will get candidate status,"" Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said as he arrived at the summit.

Earlier on Thursday, the European Parliament voted in favor of granting Ukraine and Moldova EU candidate status.

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said the vote had been ""unequivocal.""

""This will show leadership, resolve and vision in context of Russia's war against Ukraine,"" she tweeted.

North Macedonia and Albania still in limbo

EU leaders debated Thursday a recommendation from the European Commission to grant Moldova, a country that borders Ukraine, candidate status.

Meanwhile, leaders failed to break a deadlock over a stalled membership bids from North Macedonia and Albania.

The two countries were given candidate status in 2005 and 2014 respectively, and Dimitar Kovacevski, North Macedonia's prime minister, responded to the lack of progress. ""What has happened is a serious blow to the credibility (of) the European Union,"" Kovacevski told a news conference following the summit.

""For almost 20 years, the countries and the citizens of the Western Balkans have been waiting for the opportunity to become members of the European Union,"" Scholz said ahead of the summit in Brussels.

Scholz mentioned that North Macedonia had even changed its name to further its aspirations of joining the European Union."

Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Tuesday that she believes the problem regarding TÃ¼rkiye's opposition to Finland and Sweden's NATO membership will be resolved before the alliance's summit in Madrid later this month.

Marin's remarks came at a joint press conference with her Croatian counterpart Andrej Plenkovic in the capital Zagreb.

Marin said that NATO should be united and Finland and Sweden would make the alliance stronger in the long run.

Replying to a question, she said she believed a solution would be reached to TÃ¼rkiye's opposition to the two Nordic countries' NATO memberships given NATO's open-door policy.

The NATO leaders' summit is scheduled to be held from June 29-30.

Plenkovic for his part said Croatia supports Finland in its bid for NATO membership.

""We respect Finland's decision to become a member of NATO. Finland and Sweden also want NATO's security umbrella. Croatia is aware of the importance of NATO in today's world. Finland has a border with Russia,"" he said.

Sweden and Finland formally applied to join NATO last month, a decision spurred by Russia's war on Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24.

But TÃ¼rkiye, a longstanding member of the alliance, has voiced objections to the membership bids, criticizing the countries for tolerating and even supporting terrorist groups.

In its more than 35-year terror campaign against TÃ¼rkiye, the PKK -- listed as a terror organization by TÃ¼rkiye, the US and the European Union -- has been responsible for the deaths of over 40,000 people, including women, children and infants. The YPG is the PKK terror group's Syrian offshoot.

Ankara has called on Stockholm and Helsinki to prevent the terrorist group from collecting funds, recruiting new members and ensuring that it ends its activities and propaganda against TÃ¼rkiye, according to Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin.

The two prime ministers also said they agreed on granting Ukraine the status of a candidate country to the EU.

Marin also met with Croatian President Zoran Milanovic and visited Albania and North Macedonia. -

20220703,"Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices continued to rise this week amid stronger demand on the back of a blistering heatwave in Japan and a return of competition with Europe which is gearing up for possible disruption of Russian gas.

The average LNG price for August delivery into north-east Asia was estimated at $39 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), up $2 or 5.4% from the previous week, industry sources said.

“Demand from Japan on the back of a heatwave was evident as some utilities purchased prompt cargoes this week,” said Ciaran Roe, global director of LNG at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“In addition, as concerns around the length of the Freeport LNG outage mounted, the JKM (Japan Korea Marker) forward curve moved into a contango structure for September/October, having previously been in backwardation,” he added.

Contango is where a futures price is higher than the spot price, while backwardation is the exact opposite, with the forward price of the futures contract lower than the spot price.

S&P Global Commodity Insights assessed LNG prices for a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis into north-west Europe at $38.425/mmBtu on June 30, at a discount of $5.775/mmBtu to August prices at the Dutch gas hub, said Ciaran Roe, global director of LNG.

In June, for the first time in history, U.S. LNG contributed more gas supply to Europe than pipeline gas from Russia.

The European Union imported 21.36 million tonnes in the first half of 2022, up from 8.21 million tonnes in the same period a year ago, according to Robert Songer, LNG analyst at data intelligence firm ICIS.

Traders are weighing the risks of further supply reductions on Nord Stream 1, which is due for annual maintenance in July, as any further cuts or extended maintenance would to have huge implications on the European gas balance.

“The stage is set for a global tug-of-war between Europe and Asia for spot LNG cargoes, which is likely to see Asia spot LNG prices return to a premium over European gas prices,” Edmund Siau, LNG analyst at consultancy FGE said.

Another bullish factor for LNG prices is that Russia announced on Friday a decree to take full control of the Sakhalin-2 gas and oil project in Russia’s far east, a move that could force out Shell and Japanese investors.

The order creates a new firm to take over all rights and obligations of Sakhalin Energy Investment Co, in which Shell and Japanese trading companies Mitsui and Mitsubishi hold just under 50%.

Some 61% of Sakhalin exports went to Japan in the first half of this year, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Russia’s decision would not immediately stop LNG imports from the development. The same message was echoed by the Kremlin that Russia sees no grounds for LNG supplies to stop.

However, the heightened political risk may help maintain, and probably increase, the risk premium of LNG prices, according to Tamir Druz, managing director at consultancy Capra Energy.

LNG freight spot rates moved lower as vessel availability increased following the Freeport shutdown, with Atlantic rates estimated by Spark commodities at $50,500 per day and Pacific rates at $61,000 per day on Friday.

On the other hand, Goyal has other important tasks on hand like serving as the Leader of the Rajya Sabha and also handling the work in his important Ministries like Commerce and Industry, Textiles, and Consumer Affairs, Food and Civil Supplies. Being a Sherpa, Goyal's foreign travel will be affected during Parliament sessions and he would want to focus attention on Free Trade Agreement (FTA) talks with the UK and the European Union (EU). The UK and the EU are large markets and FTA would result in a boost to industries resulting in large number of jobs in sectors like textiles, leather, gems and others. The UK FTA is in advanced stages. Goyal led the FTA negotiations with Unite Arab Emirates (UAE) and Australia regardless of the odd time zones. A qualified chartered accountant, Goyal's guidance is also required at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as some countries may try to push India towards a compromise on important areas. The UK and EU FTAs will be game changers for India's labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, gems & jewellery, helping artisans, weavers, farmers and creating lakhs of jobs in smaller towns. The minister's expertise is needed here. The minister's guidance is also needed in the WTO. India achieved the best-ever outcome for the country in WTO's ministerial meeting last month. It became a dealmaker, demolishing Western propaganda about India being a dealbreaker. India protected the interests of its small fishermen and farmers, but some countries would try to push India to compromise on these key areas in future negotiations at WTO. This would require the minister's urgent attention from time to time."
20220713,"The leader of the Lebanese Hezbollah terror organization, Hassan Nasrallah, issued a stark warning to Israel on Wednesday, saying that drones sent recently to the Karish gas field were “only the beginning.”

On July 2, the Israeli military said it had successfully intercepted three Hezbollah drones that were heading for the Karish gas field off Israel’s Mediterranean coast.

In a televised speech marking 16 years since the Second Lebanon War, Nasrallah said the unarmed drones were launched “in order to make the people working in the area know that they are not safe.”

The Hezbollah leader claimed the attack was the first to include three unmanned aerial vehicles being launched toward Israel simultaneously. “So far, UAVs have been launched from the [Gaza] Strip and Syria, but one at a time. Never three at once,” he said.

“Write down this equation — we will reach Karish and everything beyond Karish and everything beyond that… If you want to prevent Lebanon from exercising its right to save itself by extracting oil and gas, no one will be able to extract oil and gas,” he added.

Nasrallah continued to claim that force was the only way to protect Lebanon’s interests, despite Lebanese leaders criticizing the terror group for the incident, saying it was an unnecessarily risky action.

“Oil and gas are Lebanon’s only way of getting out of the crisis it’s going through. The situation is dire and money provided by the World Bank won’t solve the crisis,” Nasrallah said.

“The past two months have raised a valuable opportunity to save Lebanon and we must take advantage of it now,” he continued, “Lebanon’s leverage and only source of power in the maritime border negotiations [with Israel] is its resistance and strength. We must utilize this. This isn’t psychological warfare, we are serious about this,” he said.

“We possess options in air, land and sea. They are all on the table. We will respond with appropriate force at the appropriate time and place. War is much more honorable than the situation Lebanon is heading to now — collapse and starvation.”

The Hezbollah leader also sent a direct threat to Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who said after the drone incident that Israel would “defend its infrastructure in the face of any threat” and accused Hezbollah of “undermining the Lebanese state’s ability to reach an agreement” with Israel over the maritime border.

In April, Gantz threatened to “use the necessary force against the right targets” in Lebanon, following rockets launched toward northern Israel.

“All Israelis are aware that Gantz’s threats regarding Lebanon are empty and void,” Nasrallah said Wednesday.

Addressing the ongoing negotiations between Israel and Lebanon about the maritime border between the countries, Nasrallah said: “Don’t believe the Americans.

“If you don’t implement our rights until September, the outcome will be severe,” he added, calling on Lebanese authorities to “use Hezbollah as leverage against Israel during the negotiations.”

Last month, US energy envoy Amos Hochstein discussed with Israel’s negotiating team a Lebanese proposal to resolve the maritime dispute.

According to Hochstein, Lebanon had agreed to drop demands for control of part of the Karish field claimed by Israel, asking in exchange for full control of the Qana gas field that also straddles the countries’ offshore economic zones.

Tensions surrounding the dispute have risen in recent weeks, after a gas production vessel arrived in Israel to launch extraction operations in the Karish offshore field, drawing condemnation from Lebanon, which had laid claim to parts of it.

Israel says the field is part of its UN-recognized exclusive economic zone and has been seeking to develop Karish as it tries to position itself as a natural gas supplier to Europe.

Earlier in June, Israel, Egypt and the European Union signed a memorandum of understanding in Cairo that will see Israel export its natural gas to the bloc for the first time.

Nasrallah’s speech on Wednesday coincided with US President Joe Biden’s first visit to the region as president.

Times of Israel staff contributed to this report."
20220714,"President Joe Biden has called the confrontation between autocracy and democracy the central issue of our time, and it is the cornerstone of his administration’s foreign policy. He has questioned the regime of Xi Jinping on the grounds of human rights, for the suppression of individual liberties in Hong Kong and for its threat to annex Taiwan by force. He has organized a vigorous response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, imposing economic sanctions on Russia and mobilizing significant financial and military resources in support of the Ukrainian government.

To support Ukrainian resistance to the Russian aggression, President Biden has revived the concept of the United States as “the arsenal of democracy.” This was a term coined by President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the beginning of World War II. Before the U.S. formally entered the conflict as a combatant, it provided assistance to the United Kingdom to resist Nazi aggression.

Faced with the Russian aggression, NATO has built up its strength, and the U.S. has reaffirmed its commitment to the defense of Western democracies. With respect to relations between Russia and the European countries, the U.S. has reverted to a condition similar to the way things were during the Cold War. On the foreign policy front, there has been an undeniable change in contrast to the approache of the previous administration, which was openly hostile to the European Union but expressed a curious sympathy for the autocratic regimes of Russia and North Korea.

But the biggest threat to U.S. democracy is not foreign. It is domestic, and it is political as well as judicial. In terms of partisan politics, the United States is facing the unprecedented situation of a president who refused to allow the peaceful transfer of power, and who tried to stay in office through violence,after losing the election by 7 million votes. He has also convinced his followers that his successor is an illegitimate president. Although Donald Trump is the famous participant in the threat to democracy, he is more a symptom than its cause. The fundamental problem is that the Republican Party, feeling that it is in the minority, has stopped believing in liberal democracy and is prepared to resort to illegal means to gain and exercise power against the will of the people.

The judicial expression of that phenomenon is the recent decision of the Supreme Court by a majority of extreme right justices appointed by Republican presidents, to overturn progressive decisions such as Roe v. Wade that expanded individual liberties including the right to abortion. The argument the court advanced that the right to abortion is not found in the Constitution will threaten other precedent that has legalized family planning and same-sex marriage."
20220719,"The Council of the European Union has appointed Anders Wiberg as new head of mission for the European Union Advisory Mission in Iraq (EUAM Iraq). He will take up his duties on 16 August 2022 until 30 April 2024.

Anders Wiberg is a Chief Superintendent of the Swedish National Police, a service he joined in 1991. He has also served in different international positions within the EU: he was Head of Operations of EUAM Iraq, and Chief of Staff in the Special Police Department of EULEX Kosovo.

The decision was taken by the Political and Security Committee on 19 July 2022.

EUAM Iraq is based in Baghdad with a presence in Erbil. The mission's overarching task is to assist in the development and coherent implementation of the Iraqi National Security Strategy, associated national strategies and other national security priorities. This process, supported by several international partners, involves inter alia support to institutional reform, anti-organised crime, anti-corruption, protection of cultural heritage, Integrated Border Management and counter-terrorism.

EUAM Iraq is mandated to advise officials of the Office of the National Security Adviser, the Ministry of Interior and other relevant authorities in charge of civilian related aspects of security sector reform. The mission can conduct visits at regional and provincial levels in support of Iraqi efforts to strengthen countrywide coordination as it relates to civilian security sector reform.

The mission was launched on 16 October 2017 following a request from the Government of Iraq for support."
20220720,"In a stunning turnaround, India and the European Union recently revived negotiations for a free trade agreement after talks halted nearly a decade ago — and observers say it could have been driven by“unprecedented urgency,” Trend reports citing CNBC .

Current geopolitical concerns appear to have forced both sides to iron out their differences and pursue a trade deal, though the decision to resume talks was made a year ago.

“I don't think these negotiations are going to be easy, even now. But necessity can be the mother of invention. There is indeed an unprecedented urgency to deepening India-EU ties,” said Amrita Narlikar, professor and president of the German Institute for Global and Area Studies (GIGA).

“The seriousness of new geoeconomic threats, which have most recently involved the weaponization of energy and food supplies for strategic purposes, reveal that we need more reliable value chains,” Narlikar, who is also an honorary fellow of Darwin College at the University of Cambridge, told CNBC.

“Sharing political values of democracy and pluralism, India and the EU can and should invest in the FTA, not only for trade gains but also for security gains,” she added.

The deal is expected to double trade between India and the EU in the next five years, from an estimated $115 billion in 2021, according to the Economic Intelligence Unit.

India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis formally relaunched the negotiations in Brussels in June.

“Both partners are now resuming the FTA talks after a gap of about nine years since the earlier negotiations were left off in 2013 due to difference in the scope and expectations from the deal,” India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry said.

The next round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in Brussels in September. The first round of talks took place between June 27 and July 1 in New Delhi.

 India 'sense of urgency'

High level meetings appear to have accelerated the discussions and helped lead to a clearer roadmap for the trade negotiations.

In May, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Germany, Denmark and France, while European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen made a trip to New Delhi in April.

Still, India is known to be wary of trade pacts and has walked away from previous deals before.

It's mainly due to concerns that such deals could prove detrimental to domestic producers, since they will have to compete against relatively cheaper goods coming in from other markets.

In 2019, Modi took a decisive step and withdrew India from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. It was the world's largest free trade pact, which brought the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, together with China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

But recent trends and current developments seem to indicate that the“Modi government is gearing up to be a part of the regional and multilateral architecture,” according to Rahul Mishra, senior lecturer at the Asia-Europe Institute of University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur.

“India's decision to join the U.S.-led Indo Pacific Economic Framework in May 2022 and trade talks with the UK, in addition to the already signed trade pacts with Australia and UAE indicate the sense of urgency with which the Modi government is approaching trade pacts,” he said.

“That said, it must be kept in mind that both India and the EU are tough negotiators.”

 Mutual trade benefits

The deal, if concluded, would be one of the most significant trade agreements for India as the European Union is its second largest trading partner after the U.S., according to India's commerce ministry.

It could lead to multiple benefits for both sides such as greater market access for businesses, help lower tariffs, and ease the movements of goods and people for employment purposes.

The EU, which is India's 10th largest trading partner, accounts for 2.1% of total trade in goods. Bilateral trade for services between them reached €30.4 billion ($30.68 billion) in 2020, data from the European Commission showed.

Merchandise trade between India and the EU hit an all-time high of $116.36 billion in the financial year that ended in March — up 43.5% year-on-year, according to the India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry. India's exports to the EU jumped 57% to $65 billion for the full year period, the ministry said.

While an agreement with the EU is more complex than one with an individual country, the trade deal will help companies in the 27-member bloc to access the large Indian market and diversify their supply chains, said Arpita Mukherjee, professor at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.

Indian firms may not necessarily lose out but compromise is needed, she said.

“India can use an EU-type agreement to initiate domestic reforms, improve standards and processes, which will lead to overall global competitiveness of our firms,” she added.“In any trade agreement, there will be some gainers and losers. If a country enters into a trade negotiation with a market like the EU, there is need for the domestic sector to prepare for deeper liberalization.”

“As I understand, the [Modi] government has a strong will and intention to negotiate and close the trade agreement. However, to close a deal expectations have to be met on both sides. And both sides need to make some compromises,” Mukherjee said.

 Deadline 'too ambitious'

For now, both India and the EU have expressed optimism over the talks and aim to close the deal by the end of 2023.

But achieving that target won't be easy, some analysts said. There are several sensitive issues that could potentially derail the talks.

“Next year seems too ambitious a deadline considering that both the parties are rigid in terms of their trade negotiation approaches,” said Mishra, from the University of Malaya.

“I believe it would take them at least two years more to finalize the deal. EU's non-tariff barriers, labor and phytosanitary norms are going to be a challenge, while India's sensitivities with regard to its agriculture sector might create hurdles,” for the deal to move forward quickly, he added.

The timeline“is a tall order” since there are many sticking points — ranging from tariffs over cars and wine, to visa rules for the movement of people to provide services, said Narlikar from GIGA.

“Both parties will be well served to approach these negotiations as being not 'only' about trade, but in terms of a key opportunity with wider geoeconomic implications,” she added.

“For European trade technocrats, this is not always an easy task — commitment at the highest political level and cross agency consultations will be key.”

Recognizing the broader context will“encourage both sides to make the necessary compromises on trade questions in the interest of questions of national security,” she added."
20220722,
20220725,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken's team dismissed Russian claims that Western sanctions have exacerbated the global food crisis as Moscow hopes to convert the controversy into a political advantage in the developing world.

“The fact is that we have been very specific in designing this sanctions regime to see to it that food and fertilizer from Russia is entirely exempted, to see to it that companies around the world have the assurances that they need to export these products,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has insisted that Western sanctions architects developed measures to interfere with the logistics of Russian food and fertilizer exports, even as the products themselves remain free of sanctions. He acknowledged that Moscow has used Ukraine’s blockaded grain as leverage in this dispute while characterizing the war in Ukraine as a conflict over “the future of the world order,” one that Moscow hopes will undercut the primacy of “Western civilization” in global affairs.

“It will take a long time, but we are at the beginning of a new era, which would be a movement towards real multilateralism, not to the multilateralism which the West tries to impose on the basis of the exceptional role of the Western civilization in the modern world,” Lavrov said in Cairo during an address to the Arab League, a bloc of Arabic-speaking nation across Africa and the Middle East. “The world is much richer than just Western civilization. Who but not many of you representing the ancient civilizations should know this.”

UKRAINE HOPES TO RESUME GRAIN EXPORTS IN COMING DAYS AFTER STRIKE HIT ODESA

Lavrov touted the prospect of sidelining the American dollar in global transactions as a way to hasten that process and not “be dependent on the capricious behavior of the United States and its allies.” He cited the European Union’s recent decision to write an explicit exception for ""the purchase, import or transport of agricultural and food products, including wheat and fertilizers” to argue that Western allies have lied about their culpability for the food crisis.

“True, no sanctions have been imposed on food as such, but they were instantly imposed on the companies that provide insurance for food deliveries and ensure the corresponding payments,” he told reporters in Cairo before acknowledging that Russia tied the negotiations over Ukrainian food exports to this dispute. ""In the end, we insisted that the two issues be resolved as a package.”

The fragility of the “package” deal signed Friday became apparent on Saturday, when Russia conducted strikes on the port of Odesa. Lavrov insisted Monday that such attacks remain permissible under the terms of the agreement.

“In Odesa, there is nothing in ... the agreements signed on July 22 in Istanbul that can bar us from continuing the special military operation and hit military infrastructure and other military targets,” Lavrov said while traveling in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""As for the targets hit by high-precision weapons, they are located in a separate part of the Odesa port, the so-called military part.”

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who remains a senior government official, said in May that ""our food is our quiet weapon” in the war.

“Moscow's track record when it comes to previous deals that it has struck is not exactly a cause for optimism,” Price told reporters Monday. “It harkens back to what we heard and what we saw from Russia, in the context of the humanitarian corridors that were to have been open for evacuations of civilians and others from besieged cities. In some cases, those humanitarian corridors were open for just a few days, or in some cases just a few hours, before Moscow appeared to renege on its agreement.”

The blockade of the Black Sea ports has raised the specter of a dire food crisis in Africa, according to U.N. officials. “This is not just about Ukraine, this is about the global food supply of the entire world,” U.N. World Food Program Executive Director David Beasley, a former politician from South Carolina, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week. ""We buy at the World Food Program 50% of our grains from inside Ukraine. So you can imagine the impact it has on the World Food Program alone.”

The controversy over food security and the ideological significance of the war reflects the terms of geopolitical debate in Africa, where many impoverished countries depend upon Ukrainian food exports and also have a strong memory of Western European colonialism. Russian President Vladimir Putin played on that historic context ahead of Lavrov’s trip by arguing that the U.S. alliance network is “racist and neocolonial in its essence.”

Price countered by citing Putin’s statement following an event commemorating “Peter the Great: the Birth of the Empire” — that he is following Czar Peter’s example in trying to “return and reinforce” Russian control over the territory of modern Ukraine.

20220804,"Tehran, Aug 5 : A new round of talks on the revival of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers has began in Vienna after a 150-day hiatus, according to Iran's official news agency.

The Iranian negotiating team, headed by Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani, held a meeting with the Russian delegation led by Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna and chief negotiator to the Vienna talks, Xinhua news agency reported, citing IRNA.

""The two sides had a frank, pragmatic and constructive exchange of views on ways and means of overcoming the last outstanding issues,"" Ulyanov tweeted after the meeting.

Bagheri Kani also met with Enrique Mora, the European Union chief coordinator for the Iran nuclear talks, and Secretary General of the Austrian Foreign Ministry Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal respectively.

Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to curb its nuclear program in return for the removal of sanctions on the country. However, former US President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the agreement.

The talks on reviving the JCPOA began in April 2021 in the Austrian capital of Vienna but were suspended in March this year because of political differences between Tehran and Washington."
20220803,"Azerbaijan claimed on Wednesday, August 3, to have taken control of several positions and destroyed Armenian targets, killing three people.

""Control has been established on several important heights,"" including hills, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said in a statement, adding that its forces were fortifying those positions.

Earlier on Wednesday, both sides reported the deaths of at least two Armenian separatists and an Azerbaijani soldier in violence around Nagorno-Karabakh that raises the specter of a new war - after that of 2020.

These incidents are also likely to weigh on the peace talks that have been taking place for several months between Azerbaijan and Armenia, two rival ex-Soviet republics in the Caucasus, with the mediation of the European Union.

Russia, which sponsored the ceasefire that ended the 2020 war and deployed a peacekeeping force to Nagorno-Karabakh, has accused Azerbaijani forces of violating the truce in the area of Saribaba.

Moscow, which considers the Caucasus region as its backyard, is taking “measures to stabilize the situation,” the Russian Defense Ministry added in a statement.

The European Union, for its part, called for the ""immediate cessation of hostilities"".

""It is essential to de-escalate, to fully respect the ceasefire and to return to the negotiating table to seek negotiated solutions,"" said Peter Stano, the spokesman for the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, in a press release.

On Wednesday, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry announced the death of a conscript after ""heavy fire"" targeted an Azerbaijani army position in the Lachin district, a buffer zone between the Armenian border and Nagorno-Karabakh. .

Azerbaijan claimed to have carried out in retaliation an operation called ""Revenge"", during which ""several combat positions of illegal Armenian armed elements were destroyed"".

The Ministry of Defense published a video in which we see several explosions presented as being the result of strikes on the Armenian positions.

Two members of the Armenian separatist forces were killed and 14 wounded, authorities in the enclave said, denouncing a ""flagrant violation of the ceasefire"".

Faced with this situation, the Armenian Foreign Ministry urged the international community to take measures to stop ""Azerbaijan's aggressive attitude and actions"".

As a sign of the escalation of tensions, the leader of the Nagorno-Karabakh separatists, Arayik Haroutiounian, signed a decree on Wednesday proclaiming a partial military mobilization in this territory, according to the presidency website.

After a first war that killed more than 30,000 people in the early 1990s, Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed again in the fall of 2020 for control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region which, supported by Yerevan had seceded from Azerbaijan.

More than 6,500 people were killed in this new war lost by Armenia.

As part of a ceasefire agreement brokered by Moscow, which has deployed peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, Yerevan ceded significant territory to Azerbaijan.

This agreement was experienced as a humiliation in Armenia, where several opposition parties have since demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian – whom they accuse of having made too many concessions to Baku.

>> Armenia: the Azerbaijani threat to the borders

Despite a timid diplomatic relaxation between Armenia and Azerbaijan, tensions remain strong between the two former Soviet republics.

Both countries regularly report outbreaks of violence and casualties among soldiers.

Under EU mediation, the two countries are conducting negotiations to reach a peace treaty.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev held talks in Brussels in April and May with Nikol Pashinian.

According to the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, the two leaders could meet again this summer.

The foreign ministers of the two countries also met last month in Georgia for their first direct talks since the end of the 2020 war.

The summary of the

France 24 week invites you to come back to the news that marked the week

Take international news everywhere with you!"
20220803,
20220809,"That would be sufficient for 1980 when the U.S. produced 5 billion bushels per year, with enough left over for a few hundred million bushels to be exported. But that is far from acceptable in 2022 when it will take 15 billion bushels of corn to meet the 2.5 billion bushel export demand.

Of course, Champaign, Vermilion and Douglas county farmers say Mother Nature was not kind to them this year, and rains never came. So, while 150 bushels per acre is going to make it hard to pay for fertilizer for the 2023 crop, they did the best that the weather allowed. And ironically, 150 bushels may be a bumper crop in another part of the world where weather is usually not an issue.

Not everyone may have followed what has been happening in Europe. International news sources have frequently reported record heat of more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit across much of Europe this summer. But along with that has also been a shortage of precipitation. France is a major international corn producer and in the past month over 90% of that nation has had less than 25% of typical moisture.

The Matif grain exchange in Paris reports corn prices are at record high levels, primarily because farmers are not selling. It is likely that corn sales have diminished, not because farmers are looking for higher prices, but more so because they may not have any corn to sell.

France’s corn crop probably will drop 19% this year because of the hot, dry weather, the Agriculture Ministry said Friday. The crisis is “a tragedy for our farmers, our ecosystems and for biodiversity,” according to the prime minister’s statement. Weather forecasts suggest the drought could last another two weeks and become “even more concerning,” officials said. The country just had its driest July in decades.

And what is happening with great irony, is that the first shiploads of corn coming from Ukrainian ports that have been blocked by Russia are headed for ports in the European Union. Instead of hauling wheat across the mine-laden Black Sea to African and Middle Eastern ports where millions of people are reported starving because of the Russian invasion, Ukrainian corn is headed to England and Ireland.

Other ships are hauling sunflower meal to China and sunflower oil to Italy. And there is some corn headed for Turkey. But there are no reports of grain headed to Middle Eastern or African ports. It is likely a case of nations that have the most money are getting the early grain shipments.

Those farmers in east central Illinois, where drought has been steady throughout the growing season, continue to hope for rain that will fill out corn kernels and soybean pods, and will have to depend on Ukrainian farmers to fill the export demand. Crop insurance indemnities will be their lifeline to 2023."

20220812,"After Russia invaded Ukraine last February, the European Union moved to block RT and Sputnik, two of the Kremlin's top channels for spreading propaganda and misinformation about the war.

Nearly six months later, the number of sites pushing that same content has exploded as Russia found ways to evade the ban. They've rebranded their work to disguise it. They've shifted some propaganda duties to diplomats. And they've cut and pasted much of the content on new websites — ones that until now had no obvious ties to Russia.

NewsGuard, a New York-based firm that studies and tracks online misinformation, has now identified 250 websites actively spreading Russian disinformation about the war, with dozens of new ones added in recent months.

Claims on these sites include allegations that Ukraine's army has staged some deadly Russian attacks to curry global support, that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is faking public appearances, or that Ukrainian refugees are committing crimes in Germany and Poland.

Some of the sites pose as independent think tanks or news outlets. About half are English-language, while others are in French, German or Italian. Many were set up long before the war and were not obviously tied to the Russian government until they suddenly began parroting Kremlin talking points.

“They may be establishing sleeper sites,” said NewsGuard co-CEO Gordon Crovitz. Sleeper sites are websites created for a disinformation campaign that lay largely dormant, slowly building an audience through innocuous or unrelated posts, and then switching to propaganda or disinformation at an appointed time.

While NewsGuard's analysis found that much of the disinformation about the war in Ukraine is coming from Russia, it did find instances of false claims with a pro-Ukrainian bent. They included claims about a hotshot fighter ace known as the Ghost of Kyiv that officials later admitted was a myth.

YouTube, TikTok and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, all pledged to remove RT and Sputnik from their platforms within the European Union. But researchers have found that in some cases all Russia had to do to evade the ban was to post it from a different account.

The Disinformation Situation Center, a Europe-based coalition of disinformation researchers, found that some RT video content was showing up on social media under a new brand name and logo. In the case of some video footage, the RT brand was simply removed from the video and reposted on a new YouTube channel not covered by the EU's ban.

More aggressive content moderation of social media could make it harder for Russia to circumvent the ban, according to Felix Kartte, a senior adviser at Reset, a U.K.-based nonprofit that has funded the Disinformation Situation Center's work and is critical of social media’s role in democratic discourse.

""Rather than putting effective content moderation systems in place, they are playing whack-a-mole with the Kremlin’s disinformation apparatus,” Kartte said.

YouTube's parent company did not immediately respond to questions seeking comment about the ban.

In the EU, officials are trying to shore up their defenses. This spring the EU approved legislation that would require tech companies to do more to root out disinformation. Companies that fail could face big fines.

European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova last month called disinformation “a growing problem in the EU, and we really have to take stronger measures.”

The proliferation of sites spreading disinformation about the war in Ukraine shows that Russia had a plan in case governments or tech companies tried to restrict RT and Sputnik. That means Western leaders and tech companies will have to do more than shutter one or two websites if they hope to stop the flow of Kremlin disinformation.

“The Russians are a lot smarter,” said NewsGuard's other co-CEO, Steven Brill.

SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THIS SITE, WE'VE BEEN EXPOSING THE US DISINFORMATION ABOUT ITS ACTIONSAND INTENT. THE CIA AND THE PENTAGON RUN THE SHOW... WE HAVE NO TIES WITH RUSSIA, BUT WE TRY TO HAVE PROPER TIES WITH THE TRUTH. IF THE US DID NOT FEAR THE TRUTH, JULIAN ASSANGE WOULD BE FREE.
