Oil prices remained largely unchanged Thursday as the U.S. entered its Thanksgiving Day weekend and analysts everywhere maintained their bearish mood, stoked by the watered down proposed price cap against Russia, China continuing to lockdown its cities due to Covid, and overall signs of weakening demand.

West Texas Intermediate rose 3 cents to $77.97 per barrel as of 2:16 p.m. in New York (prices didn't settle Thursday due to Thanksgiving); Brent declined 7 cents at $85.34 per barrel.

According to people familiar with the matter, European Union delegates required more time beyond Thursday to decide how strict the Russian oil cap should be, after stating that seaborne exports should be capped at $65 to $70 per barrel, well above the former Soviet Union's cost of production.

For his part, Bart Melek, global head of commodity market strategy at TD Securities, said the cap talks were ""another catalyst that served to get prices lower over the last little while,"" but he added he was fairly bullish on oil despite the headwinds.

Keshav Lohiya, founder of consultant Oilytics, argued that ""A static price in general just doesn't work: they're trying to have the best of both worlds….either you depress Russian oil to zero, which global oil markets do not want, or you let Russian oil flow.""

A higher price cap could make it attractive for Russia to continue to sell its oil, reducing the risk of a supply shortage in global oil markets.

Especially frustrated by the proposed cap was Kostas Skrekas, environment and energy minister for Greece; he told CNBC that ""A price cap at the levels that the commission is proposing is not in fact a price cap: [a] price cap at 275 euro is not a price cap, nobody can stand buying gas at this expensive price for a long time…we surely believe that the price cap below 200 euro, between 150 and 200 euro would be more realistic.""

Poland, Greece, Belgium, and Spain are among the nations supporting the cap; the Netherlands and Germany remain skeptical about the benefits of the scheme.

For the record, the war between Russia and Ukraine hit the 9 month mark on Thursday, with no sign that the latter is caving into repeated missile strikes against its energy system (shortages were cut to below 50 percent as repairs were made as quickly as possible, and water had been restored to Kyiv).

Meanwhile, the Chinese communist party continued its draconian (and hopeless, according to many health officials) zero tolerance infection policy, ordering more lockdowns and mobility curbs as virus cases approached 30,000."

1073496772,20221125,"BRUSSELS, Nov 25 — EU energy ministers failed Thursday to agree a cap on gas prices to mitigate the energy crunch in Europe, amid deep divisions over an initial proposal slammed by many as a “joke”.

The ministers will now meet in the first half of December to try to bridge differences, said Czech Industry Minister Jozef Sikela, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU.

During the “heated discussions” ministers did manage to adopt a couple of other “important measures”, including joint gas purchases to avoid intra-EU competition driving up prices, supply solidarity in times of need, and hastening authorisation of renewable energy sources, Sikela said.

Several ministers going into Thursday’s meeting complained that the gas price cap proposal on the table, unveiled by the European Commission just two days earlier, was clearly designed to never be used.

The Polish and Spanish energy ministers called the proposal a “joke”.

The price cap plan — which the commission was never keen on — sets a maximum threshold of €275 (RM1,290) per megawatt hour.

But it comes with so many conditions attached that it would not even have been activated back in August, when the gas price briefly soared above €300, alarming Europe used to historic prices around 10 per cent of that.

The cap proposal would only be triggered if the €275 limit was breached continuously for at least two weeks, and then only if the price for liquified natural gas (LNG) rose above €58 for 10 days within that same two-week period.

The price of wholesale gas in Europe on Thursday was around €124, according to the main TTF benchmark.

The commission’s proposed price cap was seen as neutered under pressure from members including Germany and the Netherlands, which feared a cap could divert gas supplies to more lucrative markets, especially Asia.

Yet at least 15 EU countries — more than half the bloc — want some form of workable ceiling on wholesale gas prices to tackle a crunch in supply forced by Russia’s war in Ukraine.

EU energy minister Kadri Simson said the European Commission was bound by “parameters” it was given by EU capitals in its formulation of a price cap, and that those governments were free to agree on a change to the parameters if they wished.

While the proposed cap “is not about one number,” she stressed the aim was to have a capping mechanism that, once activated, would stay in place for “a longer time period” and not turn on and off according to daily trading.

She also said that it was designed for next year’s gas filling season, when international competition for supplies could skyrocket.

“All signs are hinting that next year that global competition might be even significantly fiercer than it was this summer and autumn,” when European prices soared, she said.

While the European Union hasn’t banned Russian gas, the Kremlin has been turning off the taps in retaliation for sanctions imposed by Brussels in the wake of Moscow’s invasion.

Before the war, Russian gas supplies accounted for more than 40 per cent of all imported gas into the European Union, with export powerhouse Germany particularly needy.

That has now dropped to less than 10 per cent.

But alternative sources — such as LNG shipped from the United States and the Gulf — cannot make up the shortfall, and Europe faces a pricey heating bill for winter.

The price cap plan, if adopted, would start in January. It would run alongside a voluntary initiative for EU member states to cut natural gas use by 15 per cent over the northern hemisphere winter. — AFP"

• None Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions.
• None All nuclear power stations in the government controlled part of Ukraine are up and running again and connected to the main electricity grid, the country’s energy provider Ukrenergo has said. Its chief executive Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said that if the situation continues, power cuts will be pre-announced rather than in an emergency. The UN’s nuclear watchdog confirmed that Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants have been reconnected to the national power grid after completely losing off-site power earlier this week.
• None More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official in the Kyiv office of The Hague-based International Commission on Missing Persons said. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from family members, or had died and been buried in makeshift graves.
• None EU diplomats are meeting this evening to resume talks on whether they can finalise a deal on a price level to cap Russian oil exports, according to a report by Bloomberg. European Union governments remained split over at what level to cap Russian oil prices to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed to the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December.
• None Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has met with a handpicked cadre of mothers of soldiers fighting in Ukraine for a carefully staged meeting meant to calm public anger over mobilisation. While dozens of ordinary mothers have gone public saying they were snubbed by the Kremlin, Putin sat down with a former government official, the mother of a senior military and police official from Chechnya, and other women active in pro-war NGOs financed by the state.
• None In his address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one.” He also accused Russia of incessantly shelling Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that it abandoned earlier this month. Seven people were killed and 21 wounded in a Russian attack on Thursday, local authorities said.
• None Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany after the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”.
• None The Russian war effort in Ukraine is characterised by confusion among reservists over eligibility for service and inadequate training and equipment, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its daily update, the MoD said some reservists were having to serve with “serious chronic health conditions” since they were called up during Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation”.
• None The MoD said Russian soldiers are likely to have suffered heavy casualties while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while under heavy artillery fire. It added that Russian reservists have been killed in large numbers in frontal assaults into well-defended Ukrainian areas near Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Both areas are in eastern Ukraine, towards the border with Russia."
1073504166,20221125,"The race to restore power to homes in Ukraine is being slowed by “strong winds, rain and sub-zero temperatures,” the state energy supply company said in a statement on Friday.

“The pace of restoration [to household consumers] is slowed down by difficult weather conditions,” Ukrenergo said, with the damage caused by Wednesday’s large-scale Russian missile strike, “made worse by the freezing and rupture of wires in distribution networks.”

It is the second day of desperate work to keep Ukraine’s lights on.

Most power plants are now supplying energy to the national grid after they were temporarily shut down on Wednesday when Moscow sent a barrage of missiles to target energy “generation facilities” in its latest effort to cripple Ukrainian infrastructure, Ukrenergo said. Power has been restored to “critical infrastructure facilities in all regions: boiler houses, gas distribution stations, water utilities, sewage treatment plants.”

However there is still a deficit of electricity in the system and Ukrainian authorities are engaged in the delicate work of trying to balance the national power grid, leaving many households without electricity.

As repair teams worked desperately to repair the damage late on Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelensky sought to reassure the many Ukrainians facing a second night without heat, power or water. “The situation with electricity remains difficult in almost all regions. However, we are gradually moving away from blackouts and every hour we return power to new consumers,” he said in his nightly video address, in what he described as a “truly national task.”

In the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, residents woke up to a thick blanket of fog and temperatures that hovered just above freezing.

“I woke up cold. The heating and electricity are off, again. Water is there. But it might not last,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, a presidential adviser and head of the Ukrainian School of Economics, said on Twitter. He, “quickly plugged in power banks, phones, computers to charge” when the power to his apartment briefly came back on in the middle of the night. “I switched on our electric heater. My wife was half asleep but she managed to tell me what I can quickly cook.”

Half of people were without power on Friday morning, the Kyiv city military administration wrote on Telegram, and mayor Vitalii Klitschko said only one in three houses had heat. Klitschko said engineers would supply electricity to consumers in turns, for three hours, during the day.

Sergey Kovalenko, head of the YASNO energy company that supplies Kyiv, pleaded with people to be “patient,” saying: “We are talking about hours, not days, and especially not weeks.” Kovalenko said he hoped to give all residents a few hours of power on Thursday. “The power supply networks will try to evenly distribute the hours of electricity to everyone. That is, around 3-4 hours of power and then an ‘exchange,'” he said.

The attack killed at least 10 people, including a teenage girl, and “led to the temporary de-energization of all nuclear power plants, and most thermal and hydroelectric power plants,” the Ministry of Energy said. It left much of the country without power, with knock-on effects on heating, the water supply and internet access in some areas.

Wednesday was the first time that Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants were simultaneously shut down in 40 years, the head of state nuclear energy company Energoatom said in a statement. Petro Kotin said it was a precautionary measure and that he expected they would be reconnected by Thursday evening. The three fully functioning plants in Ukrainian hands — the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant has not been operating since September — would help supply electricity to the national grid, he said.

Ukraine is heavily dependent on nuclear energy, according to the World Nuclear Association. It has 15 reactors at four plants that, before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February, generated about half of its electricity.

Russia has turned its attention to destroying energy infrastructure in Ukraine ahead of the bitter winter season, and successive waves of strikes have left much of the country facing rolling blackouts.

The UN Human Rights Chief said Friday that millions of Ukrainians are being “plunged into extreme hardship and appalling conditions of life” because of Moscow’s repeated strikes on energy facilities, adding: “Taken as a whole, this raises serious problems under international humanitarian law, which requires a concrete and direct military advantage for each object attacked.”

The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has confirmed the deaths of 77 civilians since it says Russian “began its ongoing barrage of missile strikes and loitering munition attacks” on October 10.

Wednesday’s strike caused havoc across the country, with the capital Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and the entire Odesa region in the dark.

People who had taken shelter from the airstrikes in the capital left bunkers to find their homes without power and scrambled to find a place for the night with friends or family. One in four homes in the city was still without electricity Thursday morning. While the water supply was restored to all districts by mid-afternoon, it was still not working at full capacity, with those in high-rise buildings experiencing low water pressure, Klitschko said.

Video from the Reuters news agency showed people in the capital queuing to collect water from public wells in the pouring rain.

Hospitals relied on generator power or even head torches worn by staff as they continued to perform operations.

In one Kyiv hospital, doctors were performing heart surgery on a child when the power went out. Dr. Borys Todurov posted a video on Instagram that showed surgeons working by the light of their headlamps as they waited for the generator to kick in.

The director of a hospital in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, said “tens of patients in a critical condition were on surgery tables at Mechnikova Hospital” when the blackout hit.

“Anesthesiologists and surgeons put on headlights to save each of them,” Dr. Sergii Ryzhenko wrote on Facebook. He posted a photo of two doctors, who he said were Yaroslav Medvedyk and Kseniya Denysova, operating on a 23-year-old man when the electricity went down — “for the first time in 35 years of Yaroslav’s practice.”

Zelensky requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council following the strikes, which met with swift condemnation from Ukraine’s allies.

The European Union announced it would prepare a ninth package of sanctions against Moscow, in what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said was an attempt “to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine.”

French President Emmanuel Macron said Russia’s attack demanded a response. “Ukraine suffered massive shelling today, leaving much of the country without water or electricity. Strikes against civilian infrastructures are war crimes and cannot go unpunished,” he tweeted on Wednesday night.

Poland said Wednesday the Patriot missile defense system that Germany had offered Poland should go to Ukraine instead. “After further missile attacks (from Russia), I turned to (Germany) to have the proposed (Poland) Patriot batteries transferred to (Ukraine) and deployed at the western border,” Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Twitter. Germany’s offer to Poland came after a missile hit Polish territory near the Ukrainian border on November 15, killing two people.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Ukraine’s leadership could stop the suffering by meeting Russia’s demands.

“The leadership of Ukraine has every opportunity to bring the situation back to normal, has every opportunity to resolve the situation in such a way as to fulfil the requirements of the Russian side and, accordingly, stop all possible suffering of the local population,” Peskov said in a call with reporters.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defense ministry sent a tweet Thursday marking nine months since Russia’s February 24 invasion.

“Nine months. The amount of time in which a child is born. In nine months of its full-scale invasion, Russia has killed and injured hundreds of our children, kidnapped thousands of them, and made millions of children refugees,” it said.

1073507111,20221125,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices fell 2% on Friday in thin market liquidity, closing a week marked by worries about Chinese demand and haggling over a Western price cap on Russian oil.

Brent crude futures settled down $1.71, or 2%, to trade at $83.63 a barrel, having retraced some earlier gains.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down $1.66, or 2.1%, at $76.28 a barrel. There was no WTI settlement on Thursday due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and trading volumes remained low.

""Because there's light volume after the holiday, we're giving up some of the gains here a bit,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures group.

Both contracts posted their third consecutive weekly declines after hitting 10-month lows this week. Brent ended the week down 4.6%, while WTI fell 4.7%.

Brent and WTI's market structure implies current demand is softening, with backwardation, defined by front-month prices trading above contracts for later delivery, having weakened markedly in recent sessions.

For two-month spreads, Brent and WTI's structures even dipped into contango this week, implying oversupply with near-term delivery contracts priced below later deliveries.

China, the world's top oil importer, on Friday reported a new daily record for COVID-19 infections, as cities across the country continued to enforce mobility measures and other curbs to control outbreaks.

This is starting to hit fuel demand, with traffic drifting down and implied oil demand around 1 million barrels per day lower than average, an ANZ note showed.

Meanwhile, G7 and European Union diplomats have been discussing a Russian oil price cap between $65 and $70 a barrel, but an agreement has still not been reached. A meeting of European Union government representatives, scheduled for Friday evening to discuss the proposal, was cancelled, EU diplomats said.

The aim is to limit revenue to fund Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine without disrupting global oil markets, but the proposed level is broadly in line with what Asian buyers are already paying.

Poland is seeking German support to slap EU sanctions on the Polish-German section of the Druzhba crude pipeline so Warsaw can abandon a deal to buy Russian oil next year without paying penalties, two sources familiar with the talks said.

Trading is expected to remain cautious ahead of an agreement on the price cap, due to come into effect on Dec. 5 when an EU ban on Russian crude kicks off, and ahead of the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies on Dec. 4."

1073506142,20221125,"BRIDGETOWN, Barbados – Barbados has once again called on the European Union (EU) to put a halt to its persistent black-and-grey listing of CARICOM countries as non-cooperative tax jurisdictions.

The appeal on behalf of Barbados and other CARICOM and ACP countries came recently from the island's Representative Edmund Hinkson, during his attendance at the 61st Organisation of African Caribbean and Pacific (OACPS) Parliamentary Assembly and the 42nd ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Maputo, Mozambique.

The two sessions were convened between October 25 and November 2.

Hinkson presented for consideration before the ACP's Committee on Economic Development, Finance and Trade, the draft report on the EU's listing of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions and its listing of third countries regarding anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.

The draft was agreed upon by the EU's co-rapporteur and member of the European parliament, Alessandra Basso, and Hinkson as co-rapporteur on the topic on the ACP's behalf.

He also presented on behalf of the OACP, the position of these countries before the joint meeting with the European Union of the Committee on Economic Development, Finance and Trade, as co-rapporteur on the issue of the EU's listings of third states, the majority of which are ACP member states.

Speaking on his return from the high-level meetings, he noted that negotiations and further work was required on this matter. He said:“The EU has so far refused to budge on what it perceives as its right to continue its unilateral black and greylisting of countries in the CARICOM, Africa and Pacific regions as non-compliant states on ATM/CFT issues, even after they have come off the lists of the Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) and the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and even although some EU member states are seriously in breach of their own standards but are not so listed.”

He further explained that while ACP States totally agree with the EU countries that matters of tax avoidance, money laundering and terrorist financing are of paramount concern globally, not least since it is estimated that as much as US $800,000.00 are laundered annually, the ACP nations require greater structured dialogue and appropriate consultations with and wider technical assistance for capacity building from the EU to address these issues.

He noted that this is the preferred pathway rather than what currently obtains where the EU places some of our member states, including Barbados, on continuous black and grey lists on the notion that we facilitate tax evasion by external companies through our financial services and international business sectors.

“Member States called on the EU to remove the affected countries from these lists once they have come off the lists of the OECD and FAFT and to only use these listings as a last resort to address any strategic deficiencies within the legislative or administrative framework of our countries,” he disclosed.

According to Hinkson, Barbados was also instrumental in crafting the Resolution, which was carried, to acknowledge the importance of the gradual phasing out of and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

The joint assembly also debated topics on Ensuring Market Access for OACPS commodity-producing countries through enhancing sustainable consumption and production patterns; A New Framework to Address Biodiversity Crisis: Leveraging ACP-EU Partnership in shaping the new framework to halt the loss of biodiversity and to promote its sustainable use and conservation in the wake of COP 15; The Consequences of the Russian war in Ukraine on food supplies in OACPS countries and beyond; Global Challenges of Climate Change Cooperation for Adaptation and Mitigation in the Wake of COP 27, and A Mechanism for Stakeholders' consultation and engagement under the Post-Cotonou Agreement.

The next meetings of the OACPS parliamentary assembly and the ACP-EU joint parliamentary assembly are expected to be held in Sweden in February next year."
1073514509,20221125,"Warsaw, Nov 25 (IANS) Poland will receive support from the European Union (EU) post-pandemic recovery fund within a year and a half, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said.

'Our side is in ongoing talks and in ... a year or a year and a half, we will receive this money, which is why we have already started on certain projects which are being pre-financed by the Polish Development Fund,' Xinhua news agency quoted Morawiecki as saying to the local media on Thursday.

'Everything is going according to plan,' he added.

The prime minister also said that Poland and Hungary were in 'completely different places when it comes to negotiating for EU funds', and were not working together on the issue.

Both countries are deeply euro-sceptic, and have been frozen out of the fund due to their respective disputes with Brussels.

In early June, the European Commission (EC) approved Poland's National Recovery Plan, which outlines how the Polish government will spend the recovery fund.

The approval opened the way for Warsaw to receive 23.9 billion euros ($24.9 billion) in grants, and 11.5 billion euros in loans from the bloc's post-pandemic Recovery and Resilience Facility.

However, the EC has refused to grant Poland access to funding until it meets several conditions regarding the country's application of the rule-of-law."

Nguyen Huy Nhuan, Director of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, stated that in addition to the expansion of cultivation areas, locals’ application of science and technology in the production has increased and they are well aware of the role of organic fertilisers.

Besides red-flesh grapefruit, Tan Lac is also shipping its sugarcane abroad. This year, the district has been granted six planting area codes for grapefruit to be exported to the European Union.

West Texas Intermediate futures fell 2.1% to settle at $76.28 a barrel after trading in a more than $3 range on Friday. European diplomats remain locked in talks over how strict the cap should be, having previously proposed a range of $65-$70. Poland and the Baltics felt the cap was too generous to Russia and now diplomats have postponed discussions until Monday.

The cap talks come before an OPEC+ meeting early next month. Iraq and Saudi Arabia’s oil ministers met on Thursday and said the group could take further measures if required to achieve stability in the market.

Crude has declined in November, overturning the gains made in October after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed to reduce production. Mounting headwinds to crude demand have stemmed from China’s tighter economic lockdowns and fears of a US recession.

“Our balances point to slight oversupply until the end of 1Q,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Martijn Rats and Amy Sergeant said in a note to clients. “For now, the oil market is faced with macroeconomic headwinds.”

The price-cap plan forms part of the efforts by the EU and the Group of Seven to punish President Vladimir Putin for the invasion of Ukraine by reducing Moscow’s revenue, while at the same time allowing other states to continue imports. The introduction of a cap by western countries will “with high probability” have a negative effect on the energy market, Putin said.

1073521723,20221125,"Legal experts say the legislation is so vague, law enforcement officers can interpret it as broadly as they wish.

Russia’s lower house of parliament has approved unanimously a bill that effectively outlaws any expression of LGBTQ life.

The new law widens a ban on “LGBT propaganda” and restricts the “demonstration” of LGBTQ behaviour, making any action or information that is deemed to promote homosexuality – whether in public, online or in films, books or advertising – subject to a hefty fine.

The legislation still needs the approval of the upper house of parliament and President Vladimir Putin, but those steps are seen as a formality.

“Any propaganda of non-traditional relationships will have consequences,” the speaker of the lower house, or State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, said on social media.

The bill “will protect our children and the future of our country from the darkness spread by the US and European states”, he added.

Activists say the new legislation ramps up the crackdown on “non-traditional” sexual relationships in Russia, with legal experts warning its vague language leaves room for law enforcement officers to interpret it as broadly as they wish, increasing the risk and uncertainty for the country’s LGBTQ community.

Kseniya Mikhailova of the LGBTQ support group Vykhod (“Coming Out”) told the Reuters news agency that adults-only gay bars or clubs would probably still be allowed to function, although perhaps not to advertise, but that same-sex kissing in public might be taken as an infraction.

And she said same-sex couples would begin to fear that their children might be taken away from them on the grounds that they were having a so-called LGBTQ lifestyle demonstrated to them.

Legislators say they are defending traditional values of the “Russian world” against a liberal West they claim is out to destroy them – an argument also increasingly being used by officials as one of the justifications for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Authorities have already used the existing law to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights activists. Rights groups say the new law is intended to drive those leading “non-traditional” lives, including lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people, out of public life altogether.

“LGBT today is an element of hybrid warfare and in this hybrid warfare we must protect our values, our society and our children,” Alexander Khinshtein, one of the bill’s architects, said last month.

The legislation stipulates fines of up to 400,000 roubles ($6,600) for individuals and as much as 5 million roubles ($82,100) for legal entities. Foreigners could face 15 days of arrest and subsequent expulsion.

Mikhailova said the original ban nine years ago on LGBTQ “propaganda” towards minors had triggered a wave of attacks against the community, and that it could now expect a “tsunami” because the amendment in effect “says the state is not against violence towards LGBT people”.

Political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann said the law aimed to ban anything that showed LGBTQ relations or inclinations to be “socially acceptable” or “equal to so-called traditional family relations or sexual relations”.

“People – authors, publishers, just people – will think twice before even mentioning anything related to LGBT,” she said in an interview from Cologne in Germany.

On Thursday, the European Union also expressed its concern at the bill’s passage.

“These legislative developments fuel homophobia and further deepen the harsh repression of any critical and alternative discourse in the context of Russia’s illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine,” it said in a statement.

Schulmann said the bill was also a “huge win” for the communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, which had already “assumed the powers of a political police” and was now being given the authority and responsibility to monitor all kinds of information in search of so-called LGBTQ “propaganda”.

Rights groups say they will continue to fight for the rights of minorities even as the space for expression closes.

“We plan on protecting people from this absurd law,” Natalia Soloviova, chairperson of the Russian LGBT Network told the AFP news agency.

“LGBTQ people are not leaving, they still need our help and support.”"

Speaking at the launch of the project dubbed “Team Europe” on Tuesday; EU ambassador to Zimbabwe Jobst von Kirchmann said the initiative showed EU’s commitment to help build stable relations between Harare and the European bloc.

“The motto of the campaign we launch today is Zimbabwe and the European Union, Together — Tomorrow. Today, through this campaign, the EU would like to reiterate its ambition and commitment for a constructive relationship with Zimbabwe based on areas of common interest,” Kirchmann said.

Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services minster Monica Mutsvangwa said the initiative would help restore the relationship between Zimbabwe and the EU to normalcy.

“Such a noble initiative is a clear testimony of the continuous and sustainable improvement of relations between Zimbabwe and the EU. Indeed, we are excited to see Zimbabwe and EU making strides in ensuring that positive relations are restored to normalcy through diplomacy, dialogue and initiatives of common interest to support our communities,” Mutsvangwa said.

The campaign will see the EU, the EU member States and Switzerland supporting Zimbabwe’s vision 2030 with over €400 million for the next two years.

Under its Zimbabwe National Development Strategy 1 (NDS 1) and Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) policies, government's efforts to “climate-proof” its agricultural sector are already on-going through CSA investments and policy actions for a more productive, resilient, greener and low-emissions agricultural sector.

“Since these are common priorities for Zimbabwe and the European Union, the ""Team Europe"" is fully committed to supporting the achievement of these goals. Through its long-term partnership with Zimbabwe, the ""Team Europe"" works and engages with the government in various programmes to support a “greener” increase of agricultural productivity while addressing the climate related vulnerabilities of the country and building the resilience of communities,” the EU said."
1073524046,20221125,"For failing to reach its European targets for renewable energy in 2020, which it had set itself a decade earlier, the French state will have to pay out several hundred million euros. ""It will cost France €500 million this year for not having met its target for renewable energy,"" the Minister for Energy Transition told MPs on Monday, November 21, as reported by the French daily newspaper Libération. Agnès Pannier-Runacher was appearing before the commissions on economic affairs and sustainable development, as part of the review of the bill for accelerating the development of renewable energy.

France is the only one of the 27 EU member states to have missed its goal two years ago. Renewable energy represented just 19.1% of its gross final energy consumption, well below the 23% target. As this target is binding, France must now buy ""statistical amounts"" of renewable energy through a European mechanism from ""good performers"" who have exceeded their target.

""We are negotiating to buy statistical megawatts from Italy and Sweden,"" said Ms. Pannier-Runacher. On Tuesday, her team said that while the final amount could well be ""of the order of several hundred million euros,"" this had not been decided, and discussions with other member states were still ongoing.

Although the statement went unnoticed at the time, Ms. Pannier-Runacher had already mentioned a sum of €500 million at the end of September, during a conference of the Renewable Energies Syndicate (SER). ""If we had reached our objectives in 2020, we would have an additional volume of renewable energy of 64 TWh, which corresponds to 20% of industrial consumption,"" General Delegate Alexandre Roesch said. ""This delay is very damaging for the state's finances but also for the security of supply as winter approaches.""

While the risk of tension on the electricity grid will be high in January, France is still not on track to meet the renewable energy deployment targets set in its energy roadmap, the Multi-Annual Energy Program (PPE). Regarding onshore wind, between 1.2 and 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity will have been installed by 2022, short of the target of 1.9 GW. ""The targets have never been reached since 2020, and the cumulative shortfall over the last three years is about 2 GW,"" Michel Gioria, general delegate of France Energie éolienne (FEE), said. The current PPE calls for 24 GW of installed capacity in 2023, while France has about 20.3 GW today.

As for the other sectors, Mr. Roesch confirms that the country is still not on the right track. ""There has been fairly significant acceleration in solar, with significant levels of connections in 2021, but these are not yet sufficient,"" he explained. ""We are also making progress on geothermal energy, but not fast enough."" While the country's first offshore wind farm was fully commissioned off Saint-Nazaire, in western France, on Wednesday, France is still far behind its European neighbors.

The acceleration bill aims to ""halve"" the time needed to roll out these ""low-carbon"" energies, in particular by simplifying administrative procedures. The debate in the Assemblée Nationale will begin on December 5 and is expected to generate vivid discussion on how to allocate the value of renewable installations, protection of biodiversity, and, above all, the planning of the rollout. Some fear that the final bill will only give a very limited boost."

Backed by a staff of just 17, acting Energocom general director Victor Binzari and his two sidekicks have been scrambling to find new sources of power since mid-October, when Russian missile strikes in Ukraine took out the substations providing almost a third of Moldova’s electricity imports.

The remaining two thirds disappeared earlier this month, after Moscow reduced natural gas supplies to this diminutive ex-Soviet Republic, sandwiched between Ukraine, NATO member Romania and Russia’s great power ambitions.

Almost overnight, Moldova had to start buying about 80% of its power and half its natural gas from Europe — the most abrupt transition from Russian to Western energy supplies experienced by any former Soviet-bloc country since the empire began its collapse in 1989.

Russia Knocks Out the Power Keeping Millions of Ukrainians Warm

On Tuesday, Russia’s energy giant Gazprom PJSC threatened to cut gas supplies further as of Nov. 28. On Wednesday, Moldova was without power for two hours after Russian missile strikes on Ukraine interrupted emergency flows from Europe.

Energy costs have tripled or more, blowing an estimated 8% of GDP hole in one of Europe’s poorest economies and creating a ready target for Moldova’s pro-Russia opposition parties to attack the government.

“You understand that most people don’t have the possibility to pay, it is a huge difference,” Binzari said at his office in central Chisinau, squeezed between a relentless round of meetings and calls that has left him and his advisers with little sleep.

The European Union says it will help with funding, but money isn’t the only issue.

The 400 kilovolt cable from Romania through which the country now gets most of its power threads either side of the border with Ukraine before landing at a power station in Transnistria, a separatist territory that broke away from Moldova with the help of Russian troops in 1992.

Until Nov. 1, the mainly gas fired power station — run by the Russian-owned Moldavskaya GRES — provided the rest of the country with over half its electricity. Now it’s a de facto distribution hub for power on its way from Romania to Chisinau. A well-aimed Russian missile, or just the flip of a switch in Transnistria, could cut Moldova’s new European lifeline.

Wednesday’s nationwide blackout offered a foretaste. The cable from Romania likely failed in a domino effect as missile strikes disrupted the grid in Ukraine’s Odesa region, according to Maciej Wozniak, a Polish adviser sent to help Energocom.

Nations across Europe are struggling with rising energy prices, but none has seen prices rise as fast, from as low a base, or to be paid for by as poor a population. It took Poland seven years to make the transition to market prices, Wozniak said.

EU Proposes Brake on Gas Prices as Russia Squeezes AgainMoldova has not yet suffered sweeping blackouts of the kind seen in Ukraine. But President Maia Sandu said in early November that the price of gas to consumers had risen six-fold in a year, and families were now spending up to 70-75% of their incomes on utilities. Pro-Russia parties have organized protests to channel popular anger.

Russia dismisses accusations it uses energy as a weapon. Gazprom gave justifications for cuts to Moldova’s contracted supply in October and November that were commercial and technical, respectively. Flows are down 49% from the amount due this month, according to Moldova. Explaining its latest threat of further cuts, Gazprom said Ukraine was holding onto transit gas intended for Moldova.

On Wednesday, Moldovagaz Chief Executive Officer Vadim Ceban said in a Telegram post that Ukraine did hold Moldovan gas on a balancing account, but by agreement; Moldova lacked capacity to store gas that had no buyers in October’s unusually warm weather, but would take its gas as temperatures fall.

As occurred in 2006, Gazprom’s disputes with Ukraine (and now Moldova) could end up cutting onward gas supplies to Europe.

“It isn’t just a war being waged by generals in Ukraine, this is also economic and informational warfare,” said Tatiana Savva, deputy director of Moldova’s Public Property Fund, who also heads Energocom’s supervisory board and has pitched in to help Binzari.

Still, there are reasons Moldova’s worst fears may not materialize. If Transnistria cut the cable from Romania, for example, it could soon find the steel and other exports on which it depends for revenue blocked from reaching their EU markets.

The minor miracle is that Moldova’s lights have stayed on at all. Still wholly dependent on Soviet legacy energy networks until this year despite warnings, the country is suddenly having to buy electricity contracts on European exchanges. That required opening foreign subsidiaries, offices and bank accounts, as well as registering for a Romanian trading license in the space of days.

“Last year we made 10 trading contracts. In the last two weeks we signed 30,” said Savva. “Where we would like to end up is with a diversified energy supply and a fully staffed company, and I’m not talking about 17 people and a dog.”

Energocom needed so few personnel (in January there were 12, soon there will be 20) because until this year, little had changed since the USSR’s 1991 dissolution in the way Moldova got its power and gas. Electricity came from the same power plant, over the same cables, as in Soviet times.

Moldova saw the Russian energy cuts coming, said State Secretary for Energy Constantin Borosan. His ministry bought and stored as much gas as it could. It converted heating plants from gas to heavy oil, among dozens of other measures. With an assist from warm weather, he says, natural gas consumption fell almost 50% in October, year-on-year, and electricity consumption by 14.4%

But power is hard to store and failures can be destructive. Take Chisinau’s glass factory, on the outskirts of the capital, which makes bottles for wines and spirits across Europe. Just five minutes without power would force the factory’s furnace to shut down, according to Chief Executive Officer Ion Covrig.

“It would take us 15 months and many millions of dollars to rebuild the furnace so it could restart,” Covrig said. Already he’s having to adjust to energy costs that are higher than for some competitors in Europe. He had a scare during Wednesday’s blackout, when power dropped for a few seconds before backups kicked in.

According to Victor Parlicov, previously head of Moldova’s energy regulator, Soviet energy infrastructure was built to help keep the union together, which is why the high voltage cable to Romania needlessly criss-crosses the border with Ukraine.

It’s also why the Soviet leadership attached Transnistria — a slice of mainly Russian-speaking territory on the east bank of the Dniester River — to Moldova when forming the then-republic, and why the main power plant and industries were put there, Parlicov said.

He also sees significance in the date of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, because Feb. 24 was when a network test was scheduled to separate Ukraine and Moldova from the Russia-Belarus power grid for the first time, so they could trade electricity between themselves and the EU.

“Moldova was always seen by the Soviets as disloyal, and it was,” Parlicov said, because the mainly Romanian speaking region — now independent and bidding for EU membership — had revolted at every opportunity since being absorbed by the Russian empire in 1812. The web of Soviet power and pipelines supplying cheap Russian energy were designed to discourage any repeat.

1073525344,20221125,"PRISTINA — The leaders of Serbia and Kosovo reached an agreement to end their dispute over license plates, according to the European Union’s top diplomat.



“We have a deal,” said the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs Josep Borrell in a tweet on Wednesday.



The most recent rise in tensions between the two sides is over Kosovo’s plan to begin fining thousands of motorists who currently have Serb-issued license plates.



The move angered Serbs in northern Kosovo who, like Belgrade, do not recognize Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia.



Many people have resigned from public institutions to protest the new provision, including hundreds of police officers.



The deal announced by Borrell appeared to be similar to the agreement Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti failed to reach on Monday.



Borrell said that Serbia agreed to stop issuing license plates with Kosovo cities’ denomination on them while Kosovo would “cease further actions related to re-registration of vehicles.”



“This is an important achievement,” he stressed in a video statement. “I will invite the parties in the coming days to discuss the next steps.”



Kurti had previously suspended the plan to fine motorists for 48 hours due to a request by the United States.



Kosovo’s President Vjosa Osmani meanwhile thanked the US in a tweet on Wednesday ”for their active engagement in reaching today’s deal in Brussels.”



Osmani had accused Borrell of bias over his statement singling out Kosovo for the breakdown of the deal on Monday.



Borrell had criticized the leaders on Monday for failing to reach a deal, stating that he would inform EU countries and their international partners about “the unconstructive behavior of parties and complete lack of respect for their international legal obligations, and this goes in particular for Kosovo.”



Washington welcomed the agreement, with State Department spokesman Ned Price, stating that “the two parties took a giant step forward today, with EU facilitation, towards assuring peace and stability throughout the region.”



“The United States applauds the constructive negotiations and encourages further progress towards normalization of relations,” he added.



The issue of Kosovo’s independence sparked a 1998-99 war in which about 13,000 people died. Serbia launched a brutal crackdown to curb a separatist rebellion by the territory’s ethnic Albanians. NATO bombed Serbia in 1999 to end the war.



The EU-backed Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue, which is aimed at normalizing relations between the neighbors and former foes in the Western Balkans, has been at a virtual standstill for years and prompted fears that violence could flare up again.



France and Germany had sought to reinvigorate the dialogue over the past few months, by supporting the latest EU proposal.



Besnik Bislimi, Kosovo’s First Deputy Prime Minister and chief negotiator said that “after today’s agreement, we should continue our intensive talks on the proposal of EU, backed by Germany and France, for full normalization of relations.”



Petar Petković, Serbia’s chief negotiator, meanwhile said they had “saved KM plates”.



He conceded however that Serbia will not issue “completely new KM plates”, stressing that “in the last three years no new KM plates have been issued.”



“We managed to preserve peace and stability,” he went on. “The dialogue and talks continue and that is the most important thing because we need to move in the direction of normalizing relations, above all normalizing relations on the ground when it comes to normal life and the life of all people.”



Both Belgrade and Pristina have put in bids to become EU member states but neither is likely to join the bloc while their dispute remains unresolved. — Euronews"

READ MORE: Erdogan: Türkiye expects concrete steps from Sweden for its NATO bid

Sweden and Finland decided to join the western military bloc, NATO, breaking their century-long impartial stance on wars after Russia began its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on February 24.

But Türkiye and Hungary placed reservations about Nordic countries' memberships in NATO.

The Hungarian government recently announced that it will approve their membership bids in 2023 but Türkiye has conditioned its approval.

Türkiye says Sweden and Finland are harbouring and supporting terrorists mainly from the groups of FETO, PKK and its affiliations.

In June, the three nations, however, signed a trilateral memorandum of understanding at a NATO summit in Spain, in which the Nordic nations pledged to drop their support for terror groups and help Ankara fight against them.

In its almost 40-year terror campaign against Türkiye, the PKK – listed as a terrorist organisation by Türkiye, the US and the European Union – has been responsible for the deaths of more than 40,000 people, including women, children and infants. The YPG is the terror group's Syrian offshoot.

Fetullah Terrorist Organization (or FETO) is behind the 2016 defeated coup in Türkiye that killed 251 and wounded over 2,200 people.

Besides its diplomatic efforts, Türkiye continues to fight YPG/PKK in northern portions of Syria and Iraq.

On Sunday, Türkiye launched Operation Claw-Sword, a cross-border aerial campaign against the YPG/PKK terrorist group, which has hideouts across the Iraqi and Syrian borders where they plan attacks on the Turkish soil.

The operation came after a YPG/PKK terrorist attack targeted Istanbul's crowded Istiklal Avenue on November 13.

A terrorist affiliated with Syria-based YPG exploded the bomb, killing six, including two children, and leaving 81 people wounded.

Amid the Operation Claw-Sword, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated that Türkiye will root out all terrorists from the country's borders in Syria and Iraq.

Following Türkiye's anti-terror operation, some YPG/PKK supporters gathered in Stockholm's main square to show support for the group in Syria.

Turkish officials say that Finland is closer to being a NATO member rather than Sweden, noting that Stockholm is dragging its feet on fighting against those groups.

Meanwhile, Turkish, Swedish and Finnish delegations will meet in Stockholm for the second time to discuss NATO membership and the Nordic countries' measures against terrorism.

1073545095,20221125,"MONROVIA – The Government of Liberia, through the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, and the Delegation of the European Union to Liberia, host today a policy dialogue aimed at reviewing the portfolio of the European Union (EU) programmes in Liberia.

This review, which brings together several stakeholders and partners, is aimed at gaining insight into the impact of the EU projects implemented in partnership with the Liberian government on targeted communities and groups in Liberia.

The dialogue will identify challenges and lessons learned, and make recommendations to improve the implementation of EU programmes in Liberia for future collaboration.

This review will also contribute to building and strengthening the capacities of Liberian institutions to ensure the sound management and sustainability of EU programmes in Liberia, in support of the effective implementation of the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD), to the benefit of the Liberian people.

The Head of Delegation of the European Union, Ambassador Laurent Delahousse, said “The EU is here to deliver to the people of Liberia. This is done by our programmes, implemented through teamwork with the Government and our implementing partners. The Portfolio review will help in assessing how well all of us are doing and how to improve our collective performance to serve the objectives of the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development”.

The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) recognizes that each country has primary responsibility for its own development progress, that development assistance must be country-led, and that donors and recipients have a shared responsibility to ensure the successful implementation of assistance activities.

In this light, it is important for the Government of Liberia (GOL) and its international partners to periodically review the international partners’ assistance programmes to ensure that they are aligned with Liberia’s own developmental priorities. Therefore, the European Union, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, is conducting a Country Portfolio Review.

General Overview of the EU Portfolio in Liberia

The European Union is one of the largest providers of external assistance to Liberia. The EU National Indicative Programme for Liberia in the period 2014-2020, under the 11th European Development Fund, amounted to USD 326 million (EUR 279 M), and included the following focal sectors:

The European Union also supports Liberia through General Budget Support to the Liberian budget enabling Liberia to increase its national budget and be able to pay teachers, nurses, doctors, and free resources for important investments.

The EU programmes are aligned to the four pillars of the government of Liberia’s Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD):

In the period 2021-2027, the EU will remain a solid partner of Liberia, through a new EU cooperation instrument, the “NDICI-Global Europe” (Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument) and its 3 pillars (geographic, thematic, rapid response). Liberia will continue to receive consistent EU financial support through the NDICI-Global Europe. The EU will seek to enhance the impact of the EU cooperation on the ground, to the benefit of the Liberian people. The EU Multi-annual Indicative Programme (MIP) 2021-2027, which specifies the focal sectors for the EU cooperation in Liberia, was approved in December 2021. The cooperation of the EU and EU Member States with Liberia is driven by a Team Europe approach, seeking to maximize the unity, coordination, complementarity and impact of the combined actions of the EU and EU Member States (Germany, Ireland, France and Sweden have Embassies and bilateral programmes in Liberia), with the aim to obtain real, sustainable results in Liberia, to deliver to the Liberian people."

1073548680,20221125,"The European Parliament has ruled in favor of designating Russia as a “state sponsor of terrorism.” Its lawmakers cited the atrocities Russia has committed in Ukraine, including human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian laws.

The European Parliament Wednesday passed a resolution declaring Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. 494 members voted in favor, 58 lawmakers voted against, and 44 lawmakers abstained from the vote. The resolution is mainly symbolic, as there is no legal framework for the bloc to back it up.

“The deliberate attacks and atrocities carried out by the Russian Federation against the civilian population of Ukraine, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, and other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law amount to acts of terror,” said the resolution.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the decision by the European Parliament. Zelenskyy said that Russia must be “isolated at all levels and held accountable in order to end its long-standing policy of terrorism in Ukraine and across the globe.” Zelenskyy also urged the United States and other countries to take the same measure as he continued to accuse Moscow of targeting civilians. Russia has denied doing so.

The European Union, the US, and the United Kingdom have already imposed an unprecedented number of sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine back in February. Despite the move by the European Parliament, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has ruled out placing Russia on the country’s terrorism list, despite resolutions from Congress in favor of making the designation.

The designation by the European Parliament also follows the measures by Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, and Estonia, which have previously designated Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.

Zelenskyy has since urged the United Nations Security Council to act against Russia over repeated air strikes on its civilian infrastructure that has plunged most of Ukraine into darkness. The council is unlikely to be able to take action as Russia is one of the council’s permanent members with veto power.

US ambassador to UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Vladimir Putin was weaponizing winter “to inflict immense suffering on the Ukrainian people.”"
1073552118,20221125,"A European Union drug monitoring agency is sounding alarms over rising recreational use of nitrous oxide, also known as ""laughing gas.""

In addition to industrial uses, the gas is used as a sedative in medical and dental procedures, and as a propellant in whipped cream canisters. Classified as a depressant, it's typically consumed by inhaling it from party balloons, and is frequently used in tandem with drugs like ketamine or MDMA.

Inhaling it can foster a sense of euphoria, relaxation and dissociation from reality. In most places, anyone can legally buy it at a convenience store, supermarket or online -- and cheaply.

""A profitable and expanding supply chain has developed, with specialised internet stores directly promoting the gas for its recreational use or offering it under the guise of its use to make whipped cream,"" says the EMCDDA.

Commonly called ""hippy crack"" or ""nos,"" it's become a common fixture at music festivals. According to Reuters, concerns started mounting in 2017 with the introduction of larger canisters that deliberately targeted recreational users. In the UK, nitrous oxide is now the second-most-used drug among 16- to 24-year-olds.

The popularity of the gas is elevated by the ease with which it's consumed and shared -- usually by filling party balloons with the gas. Some users cut out that middle step, and suck it straight from the canister -- risking lung injuries and cold burns.

That's just the start of the dangers. According to WebMD, the gas can cause lower blood pressure, fainting, heart attacks, suffocation, irreversible vitamin B12 inactivation, anemia, nerve damage, memory loss, incontinence, depression, weakened immunity, numbness of hands and feet, limb spasms and ringing ears.

""This stuff is dangerous. Seven years ago, this was a neurological rarity, even a couple of years ago I was seeing cases maybe once a month, now I'm seeing them every week,"" said Dr David Nicholl, a UK neurologist.

The EMCDDA says the number of poisonings is still ""relatively small in number,"" but increasing sharply:

The UK Daily Mail this week shared some laughing gas horror stories: A teen with a ruptured lung, a woman with a damaged spinal cord now partially paralyzed and forced into a wheelchair.

A road safety group says the gas contributed to 1,800 vehicle accidents in the Netherlands alone in the past three years. In January, the Dutch government will institute a ban on the purchase, sale or possession of the gas, with exceptions for its continued use in medicine and in food packaging.

Bans and limitations are under consideration in the UK and elsewhere. The EMCDDA cautions that ""any response measure needs to consider the widespread legitimate uses of nitrous oxide by industry, healthcare and consumers."""
1073552119,20221125,"European Union special representative for human rights calls on Ethiopia to fully implement the recommendations of the human right reports.

 EU special representative for the horn of Africa, Eamon Gilmore, has paid a three-day visit to Ethiopia starting from May 16-18. During his visit, the special representative met with high government officials including president Sahile-work Zewde and Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonen.

 During the press conference on May 18, the EU special representative said that currently there are three main issues that need to be addressed as the EU member state prep for a ministerial meeting which will be held in June to decide on the Union’s financial and overall re-engagement with Ethiopia.

 The first issue that requires attention is noted to be the humanitarian situation in the country. “There have been difficulties in getting humanitarian assistance,” said Eamon with the difficulties cited to be from issues in administration, permits, and related to humanitarian routes. The national dialogue and human rights as well as the issue of accountability are also said to be the other two main issues.

 “We have been shocked by the reports from the course of the past year and a half or more, which have emerged of very serious human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law,” said Eamon Gilmore adding, “we’re keen to see follow up on those reports and accountability for the perpetrators of the human rights violations, which have occurred irrespective of when they occurred, where they are, or who they are.”

 “We’ve seen here on extrajudicial killings, involving serious sexual violence and gender based violence during the course of the conflict,” Eamon said whilst highlighting the plight that the people of the country have gone through as victims of human rights violations.

 The representative asserts that even though the joint investigation by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is supported by the Union, it is also keen to see more follow-ups done on the report.

 “The issue is implementations of recommendations which the 27 foreign ministers will ask in the June meeting,” underlined Eamon as he explained that the members States will decide on the Union’s financial and overall re-engagement with Ethiopia, adding, “we want to contribute on the humanitarian efforts hence our main concern is to move a side the obstacles.”

 The special representative will also represent its report of the visit on next meeting of the Human Rights Dialogue, which will take place in Brussels in early December."

West Texas Intermediate futures fell 2.1 per cent to settle at US$76.28 a barrel after trading in a more than US$3 range on Friday. European diplomats remain locked in talks over how strict the cap should be, having previously proposed a range of US$65-US$70. Poland and the Baltics felt the cap was too generous to Russia and now diplomats have postponed discussions until Monday.

The cap talks come before an OPEC+ meeting early next month. Iraq and Saudi Arabia’s oil ministers met on Thursday and said the group could take further measures if required to achieve stability in the market.

Crude has declined in November, overturning the gains made in October after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed to reduce production. Mounting headwinds to crude demand have stemmed from China’s tighter economic lockdowns and fears of a U.S. recession.

“Our balances point to slight oversupply until the end of 1Q,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Martijn Rats and Amy Sergeant said in a note to clients. “For now, the oil market is faced with macroeconomic headwinds.”
• WTI for January delivery fell US$1.66 to settle at US$76.28 in New York
• There was no settlement on Thursday due to Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S.
• Brent for January settlement fell US$1.71 to settle at US$83.63

The price-cap plan forms part of the efforts by the EU and the Group of Seven to punish President Vladimir Putin for the invasion of Ukraine by reducing Moscow’s revenue, while at the same time allowing other states to continue imports. The introduction of a cap by western countries will “with high probability” have a negative effect on the energy market, Putin said."

1073558785,20221125,"The European Union has called an emergency meeting of Home Affairs ministers to discuss migration.

There is a growing concern in the bloc following a recent diplomatic row between France and Italy over the Ocean Viking ship, as well as the arrival of 450 migrants on the Greek island of Crete.

The Cypriot Minister of the Interior was one of many politicians to express his fears.

""We are seeing that traffickers are adopting new methods and means. Now, they use large private boats, and commercial ships to transport migrants,"" said Nicos Nouris.

""We consider this to be a dangerous tactic and we are talking about large numbers of people. Honestly, I don't know how the Mediterranean countries will manage to face this new threat,"" he explained.

A diplomatic row erupted earlier this month when Italy forced France to accept a humanitarian rescue ship, the Ocean Viking, with 234 migrants aboard.

France retaliated by suspending its participation in an EU solidarity pact to accept 3,000 people who had arrived this year in Italy and sent officers to reinforce its southern border crossings and prevent migrants from entering.

EU Home Affairs ministers are holding emergency talks on Friday in an effort to find a permanent solution.

On the agenda is a proposal to change the asylum application process so that a refugee submits a request to the embassy of the country where they want to live.

Southern Mediterranean countries also want member states to start taking in more refugees.

Member states have so far offered to take in less than 2,000 out of 160,000 migrants that arrive on European shores every year.

For years, member countries have argued over who should take responsibility for those arriving and whether partner countries should be obliged to help.

Unable to agree, the nations have sought to outsource the problem by clinching deals with north African countries like Libya.

EU countries and the Commission have also rejected any attempts to set up a concerted search and rescue mission to deal with the problem, arguing that such a scheme would only attract more people."
1073558788,20221125,"The ECOWAS Commission and Political Officers/Military Advisors of the Diplomatic Corps have resolved to continue to promote inclusive and peaceful transitional process in West Africa.

This came to the fore during the briefing of the Political officers/Military Advisors of the Diplomatic Corps by the Mediation and Coordination of Political Affairs Division of the Political Affairs Peace and Security Department on the 24th of November 2022 in Abuja, Nigeria.

In his welcome address during the briefing, the ECOWAS Commission’s Commissioner for Political Affairs Peace and Security (CPAPS) Dr. Abdel-Fatau Musah maintained that given the dynamics of political and socio-economic situation in the region, ECOWAS would continue its avowed role of accompanying its Member States on their democratic, peace and stability processes.

Stressing the importance of the facilitating role of the ECOWAS mediators to countries, under-going various forms of transition processes, Dr. Musah, noted that the current mechanisms of mediation and intervention should be periodically reviewed to accommodate best practices and ensure that a lot more is done beyond kinetic interventions by constituted authorities. He also stressed on the need to operationalize the regional Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) within the next two years and bring civil actors in the region to the dialogue table.

The lead presentation of the briefing was made by the Director, Centre for Democracy and Development Dr. Idayat Hassan who expounded the various dimensions of the topic: Promoting an inclusive and peaceful transitional process in West Africa: The role of civil society in the transitional processes.

She identified two converging trends-Insecurity and contested elections as well as the underlying desire by some incumbent leaders to manipulate the democratic processes through non-inclusive constitutional changes.

Going forward and to stem the increasing threat of a relapse of dictatorial tendencies, she recommended among others, a critical look at the role of information disorder (mostly emanating from digital technology), disinformation, proliferation of actors and techniques as well as home grown solutions while ensuring that responses are driven by community actors and institutions.

The briefing which had an array of political officers and military advisors from the diplomatic corps in Abuja, featured robust exchanges of ideas and analysis, of the socio-political environment in the region also received goodwill messages from Mr. Thomas Kieler, the representative of the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, who pledged the continuous support of the EU to the ECOWAS political intervention processes.

The bi-annual briefing, which is the second for 2022, serves as a structured platform, for interface and exchange of ideas on peace and security issues, between the ECOWAS Commission and the diplomatic community in Abuja.

Car production grew 7.4 percent on a yearly basis in October, reversing a 6.0 percent decrease in September. 



Demand from domestic market increased 12.5 percent and that from foreign market climbed 6.3 percent in October. 



Still October's overall performance was -48.4 percent off 2019's total of 134,669 units. 



The annual growth in shipment was driven by the 26.4 percent rise in exports to the U.S. and 6.0 percent increase in exports to Japan. Demand from South Korea and Australia surged 68.7 percent and 125.4 percent, respectively. 



By far the majority of cars heading overseas went into the European Union, even though exports to the bloc declined 2.7 percent, the lobby said.

The complaint relates to Raab’s tenure at the former Department for Exiting the European Union, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s spokeswoman Camilla Marshall told reporters on Friday. It was received by the Cabinet Office on Wednesday, she said.

Adam Tolley, an employment law specialist leading the probe into bullying allegations against Raab, has been asked by Sunak to consider the latest complaint as part of the investigation, Marshall said.

The other two complaints against Raab were lodged last week but date from his previous tenure as justice secretary and his time as foreign secretary. The deputy premier has denied all bullying allegations made against him, while vowing to “cooperate fully” with any probe and respect its outcome."
1073562612,20221125,"(Bloomberg) -- With European Union diplomats haggling over a price cap on Russian oil, it’s worth remembering that the level they’re discussing will almost certainly be above where the nation’s flagship grade currently trades.

European Union diplomats have this week been discussing a cap at somewhere around the $65-to-$70-a-barrel mark. When it does get imposed, the limit is expected to be adopted by all Group of Seven nations in a process that the US has led.

But anything in that range would be far above the current price of Russia’s flagship Urals grade, according to data provided by Argus Media Ltd., a publisher of physical commodity prices. Urals fell to around $52 a barrel on Thursday at two of the country’s key western export terminals, the firm’s data show.

Any buyer paying more than the cap will not be allowed to access European -- especially Greek -- oil tankers, or industry standard insurance against risks like oil spills. The higher it is, the more favorable to exports.

If the cap were to be agreed in the $65-to-$70 range, Russia and its customers could get higher prices and be certain of their ability to access the necessary vessels.

Currently they are not, creating an uncertainty about cargo transportation and a potential deterrent for some buyers. The EU itself will ban almost all seaborne imports from Dec. 5.

The bloc is still in extended talks on the cap. Some members, such as Poland, regard $65 as being too soft on Moscow, while members like Greece, the world’s top oil-tanker owning nation, doesn’t want to go below $70.

A cap wouldn’t be a complete win for Moscow. Oil prices can rise as well as fall, and if the cap becomes an entrenched part of the market, Russia could miss out on future rallies.

There is significant uncertainty about Russian oil prices because trading of the nation’s cargoes has become less transparent since the war. However, Platts, a price-publisher that’s part of S&P Global Inc., also assessed the price of Urals at the Russian port of Primorsk at around $52 on Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Argus price is used by Russia’s finance ministry to calculate export duties.

Consultant FGE said in a note that the cap poses little downside to current realized prices and could even equate to a $3-$4 upside for Urals."

• Oil benchmarks crept higher Friday, with Brent crude at $86.68 a barrel and WTI at $79.76.
• Discussions about western countries capping Russian crude at between $65 and $70 a barrel continue.
• China reported a record number of COVID-19 infections on Friday, sparking fears of slowing demand.

Oil prices edged higher on low trading volume Friday even as western countries continued their discussions about a price cap on Russian crude and China enforced further lockdown measures.

Brent crude traded 1.7% higher at $86.68 a barrel at last check, while WTI crude had climbed 2.3% to $79.76 a barrel.

Those benchmarks are still on course to finish in the red this week as talks of a price cap on Russian oil continue.

Diplomats from the G7 group of countries and the European Union are discussing capping Russian oil at between $65 and $70 a barrel as part of a broader sanctions package. Russian Urals oil slipped 5.3% on Friday to $67 a barrel.

""Talks will continue on a price cap but it seems it won't be as strict as first thought, to the point that it may be borderline pointless,"" Oanda market analyst Craig Erlam said.

""That's hit oil prices again this week as the threat to Russian output from a $70 cap, for example, is minimal given it's selling around those levels already.""

Further Covid-19 lockdowns in China could also weigh on crude prices, Erlam said. The world's top oil importer logged a new daily case record on Friday, with Beijing putting cities across the country into lockdown. The move could reduce oil demand.

""Lockdowns in all but name appear to be popping up in major Chinese cities in an attempt to get a grip on record cases which will weigh heavily on economic activity once more and in turn demand,"" Erlam said.

""It's now a question of how long they last but clearly investors' enthusiasm toward the relaxation of Covid restrictions was a bit premature.""

1073567698,20221125,"The Government of Liberia, through the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, and the Delegation of the European Union to Liberia held a one-day policy dialogue on Thursday aimed at reviewing the portfolio of the European Union (EU) programmes in Liberia.

This review, which brings together several stakeholders and partners, is aimed at gaining insight into the impact of the EU projects implemented in partnership with the Liberian government on targeted communities and groups in Liberia.

The dialogue will identify challenges and lessons learned and make recommendations to improve the implementation of EU programmes in Liberia for future collaboration.

This review will also contribute to building and strengthening the capacities of Liberian institutions to ensure the sound management and sustainability of EU programmes in Liberia, in support of the effective implementation of the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD), to the benefit of the Liberian people.

The Head of Delegation of the European Union, Ambassador Laurent Delahousse, said ""The EU is here to deliver to the people of Liberia. This is done by our programmes, implemented through teamwork with the Government and our implementing partners. The Portfolio review will help in assessing how well all of us are doing and how to improve our collective performance to serve the objectives of the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development"".

The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) recognizes that each country has primary responsibility for its own development progress, that development assistance must be country-led, and that donors and recipients have a shared responsibility to ensure the successful implementation of assistance activities.

In this light, it is important for the Government of Liberia (GOL) and its international partners to periodically review the international partners' assistance programmes to ensure that they are aligned with Liberia's own developmental priorities. Therefore, the European Union, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, is conducting a Country Portfolio Review.

General Overview of the EU Portfolio in Liberia

The European Union is one of the largest providers of external assistance to Liberia. The EU National Indicative Programme for Liberia in the period 2014-2020, under the 11th European Development Fund, amounted to USD 326 million (EUR 279 M), and included the following focal sectors:

The European Union also supports Liberia through General Budget Support to the Liberian budget enabling Liberia to increase its national budget and be able to pay teachers, nurses, doctors, and free resources for important investments.

The EU programmes are aligned to the four pillars of the government of Liberia's Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD): Pillar 1: Power to the People; Pillar 2: Economic and Jobs; Pillar 3: Sustaining the Peace and Pillar 4: Governance and Transparency

In the period 2021-2027, the EU will remain a solid partner of Liberia, through a new EU cooperation instrument, the ""NDICI-Global Europe"" (Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument) and its 3 pillars (geographic, thematic, rapid response). Liberia will continue to receive consistent EU financial support through NDICI-Global Europe. The EU will seek to enhance the impact of the EU cooperation on the ground, to the benefit of the Liberian people.

The EU Multi-annual Indicative Programme (MIP) 2021-2027, which specifies the focal sectors for the EU cooperation in Liberia, was approved in December 2021. The cooperation of the EU and EU Member States with Liberia is driven by a Team Europe approach, seeking to maximize the unity, coordination, complementarity and impact of the combined actions of the EU and EU Member States (Germany, Ireland, France and Sweden have Embassies and bilateral programmes in Liberia), with the aim to obtain real, sustainable results in Liberia, to deliver to the Liberian people."

The attacks shut down most of the country's power plants and left the ""vast majority"" of Ukrainians without power, the national energy company Kurenergo said. The company said Wednesday's attacks caused ""systemic"" problems, so repairs were ""taking longer than after previous attacks."" Power production had been restored across Ukraine by late Thursday, but residences were only ""gradually being connected to the grid,"" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an official in President Volodymyr Zelensky's office, said on Telegram. The United States marked the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday with a return to traditional feasts and parades, and travel estimated to have returned to near pre-pandemic levels. Millions of Americans spent part of the day watching football or the 96th annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the second full parade of marching bands and giant helium-filled balloons through Manhattan since the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to hold a reduced, block-long version in 2020. ""We just want to say we're so grateful for the people, for this opportunity, for the health that we have now in America,"" first lady Jill Biden said in a video call she and President Biden had with NBC's Today hosts. Elon Musk said Thursday that he would reinstate most banned Twitter accounts, after 72.4 percent of respondents to a Twitter poll said they favored ""a general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam."" Musk, Twitter's new owner, said Thursday: ""Amnesty begins next week."" The news sparked concern among online safety experts, who warned the decision could result in a surge of harassment, hate speech, and misinformation. Musk recently said he was lifting a ban on former President Donald Trump's account that was imposed after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, although Trump, who now has his own social media company, has said he has no plans to return to Twitter.

President Biden on Thursday renewed his call for a ban on assault weapons in response to the latest mass shootings in the U.S. ""The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick. It's just sick,"" Biden said during a stop at a fire station in Nantucket, Massachusetts. The remarks came after two recent and high-profile deadly shootings. In one, a night manager at a Virginia Walmart allegedly opened fire on co-workers, killing six people. In the other, a suspect was charged with murder and hate crimes after a shooting that left five people dead at a LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs. Now that Republicans have won control of the House in the next Congress, a ban would have little chance of passing, according to ABC News. Iranian authorities on Thursday arrested prominent Iranian soccer player Voria Ghafouri, a frequent government critic, on charges of damaging the national team's reputation, per state-linked Iranian media outlets. Ghafouri, a former member of Iran's national team, was arrested after current team members faced intense scrutiny during the World Cup in Qatar. During a match with England on Monday, Iranian players declined to sing their country's national anthem in what was widely interpreted as a show of support for women's rights protests that have erupted back home. The United Nations Human Rights Council voted Thursday to investigate alleged rights violations in the Iranian government's crackdown on protesters. Lockdowns imposed in China this week in response to the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreak are stoking concerns that global supply chains could face renewed disruptions. Authorities on Thursday ordered residents of eight districts in the manufacturing hub of Zhengzhou, home to 6.6 million people, to stay home for five days, allowing them to leave only to buy food or to seek medical care. The broadening lockdowns could hold back global economic growth, according to many economists. The potential slowdown in the world's second largest economy comes as the United States and other nations lose economic steam while central banks raise interest rates aggressively to bring down inflation.

Centrist Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Democratic incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola have won their elections, the Alaska Division of Elections announced late Wednesday. Murkowski and Peltola endorsed each other as both faced Republican challengers. Murkowski beat challenger Kelly Tshibaka, who had the support of former President Donald Trump, 53.7 percent to 46.3 percent. Peltola defeated ex-Alaska governor and former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin 54.9 percent to 45.1 percent. Peltola, a former state legislator, beat Palin and another Republican, Nick Begich III, in a special election in August to become the first woman to represent Alaska in the House and the first Alaska native in Congress. She now will serve a full two-year term. European Union nations failed to reach an agreement on a natural gas price cap in an emergency meeting on Thursday. Energy ministers in the 27-nation bloc are seeking ways to protect their 450 million residents from huge utility bill increases this winter as Russia's continued occupation of Ukraine threatens to send heating costs soaring. Some nations, including Greece, Spain, Belgium, France, and Poland, are pushing for ways to make gas cheaper, while others, like Germany and the Netherlands, warned of possible shortages if EU members are prevented from buying gas above a set price. ""The discussion was quite heated,"" said Czech Industry Minister Jozef Síkela, who chaired the meeting. E. Jean Carroll, the former magazine columnist who has accused former President Donald Trump of raping her in the mid-1990s, filed a second lawsuit against Trump for battery and defamation on Thursday. The filing came on the first day civil lawsuits could be brought under New York's Adult Survivors Act, a new law affording adults a one-year window to file a claim years after an alleged sexual attack. Trump has denied Carroll's allegation that he raped her in the dressing room of a New York department store. Carroll is asking a judge to order Trump to retract his statements calling her story a ""hoax and a lie,"" and also award unspecified damages.

The holiday shopping season kicks off unofficially with Black Friday, but post-Thanksgiving crowds are expected to be watching every dollar this year as continued high inflation threatens their buying power. The National Retail Federation projects holiday sales to grow 6 percent to 8 percent, down from a strong 13.5 percent last year and possibly marking a decline after adjusting for inflation. Recent data has shown that Americans are increasingly holding out for big discounts, or replacing luxury goods with less expensive alternatives. Shoppers also are more likely to choose ""buy now, pay later"" options this year and pay in installments, according to The Associated Press."

These agreements will allow the project to enter into an operational phase, which will see the start of works in 2023. The cable will run 575 kilometres from the south coast of Ireland to the northwest coast of Brittany and will be able to import and export enough electricity to power 450,000 homes. The project is expected to be built and operational by 2026.

The Interconnector will link the commune of La Martyre in Brittany to the village of Knockraha in County Cork, Ireland, which have been identified as the optimum locations for grid connection in both countries.

The strategic nature of this project was recognised by the European Union, which partially funded it and designated it as a Project of Common Interest (PCI). A PCI is an infrastructure project that connects the energy systems of EU states and gives access to financial support through the European Interconnection Mechanism (EIM) loan instrument – a fund for developing Europe's energy, transport and telecommunications networks.

""The Celtic Interconnector technical and financing agreements confirmed today are the starting point for the construction of this historic subsea cable between East Cork and Brittany. It will connect the Irish and French electricity networks and will improve the security of our electricity supply, help us to achieve our climate objectives and reduce the cost of electricity. It means that we can import energy from Europe when we need it, and critically, it means that we can also export energy, particularly when we begin to realise the enormous potential of our off-shore wind capacity.""

""Russia’s use of energy as a weapon has reinforced the need to make EU energy system more interconnected, more reliable and efficient. In 2019, RTE and EirGrid secured €530.7 million of Connecting Europe Facility funding for the project. The Celtic Interconnector will help us achieve just that: improving the security of electricity supply in Ireland and supporting the development of renewable energy in both Ireland and France. Today, Ireland, France and the EU as a whole are showing to the world how European solidarity works in the energy sector."""
1073570828,20221125,"The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has reached some 1.2 million vulnerable people with US$ 17.5 million cash assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) this year thanks in part to a contribution from the European Union (EU).

The contribution, which was received through the European Union’s Humanitarian Aid department (ECHO), has allowed WFP to provide life-saving assistance to people in eastern DRC, where intensifying violence is worsening food insecurity and decimating people’s livelihoods.

Conflict in the east of the country remains the main driver of food insecurity and the source of Africa’s largest displacement crisis with 5.7 million people displaced.

“Money for families means they can afford food and medicines – this is critical when you are uprooted by conflict, and you have lost your homes and income,’’ said Peter Musoko, WFP’s Country Director in DRC. “We need to continue to be able to respond at scale and ensure that affected communities have continued access to the critical food assistance they require.’’

While the deteriorating security situation limits WFP’s access to those most in need, cash is one of the most effective ways for WFP to help displaced families fight hunger, malnutrition and improve their food security.

“The EU has been funding WFP for many years in its efforts to address food insecurity in areas affected by conflict in the east of DRC,” says Johan Heffinck, EU Humanitarian Aid’s Head of Office in DRC. “This strategic partnership helps address our humanitarian priorities to assist internally displaced persons as quickly as possible. This makes our partnership very important.”

Where markets and financial sectors are functioning, putting money directly into people’s hands helps them to buy what they need the most. It gives them greater choice and independence. Latest WFP analysis shows that over 10 percent of the assisted people have an acceptable food consumption score, representing an increase of over 4 percent compared to 2021 in Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, Tanganyika, and Haut Katanga as a result of the support.

“Between in-kind food assistance and cash assistance, I preferred cash because, having lost everything, we are able to better prioritize needs,” said Emedi Kisimba, who received WFP’s cash assistance in 2021. “I invested my money in livestock, which I sell to pay school fees for my three little brothers in secondary school. I also sell goats to pay for my children’s health care and for food expenses.”

According to the latest IPC report, over 26 million people, or a quarter of the population, are facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above). Maintaining regular food assistance is vital, especially during the lean season. Even when food is available, higher prices, triggered partly by rising fuel and transport costs, mean that vulnerable households cannot afford sufficient and proper nutritious food.

Continued support from donors such as the European Union is providing a lifeline for families in the DRC facing increased insecurity and deteriorating socio-economic conditions. Despite the challenging operating environment, WFP plans to reach a record 8.6 million people in DRC this year — over two million more than it supported in 2021 and needs an additional US$116 million to support critical programmes for the next six months.

New figures show that 69,524 cars rolled off production lines last month, an increase of 7.4% compared with October 2021. The number of cars produced for the UK market was up 12.5% and the number made for overseas markets rose by 6.3%.

This followed a fall in September after four consecutive months of growth, illustrating how global chip shortages and other supply chain issues are continuing to affect UK car manufacturers.

Output in October was still down 48.4% compared with 134,669 cars produced the same month in 2019, and 52.8% off the five-year pre-Covid average for the month.

More than eight in 10 (81.2%) cars made were sent overseas, equivalent to 56,469 vehicles, while 13,055 were destined for the domestic market.

Export growth was led by rising shipments to the US (26.4%), Japan (6.0%), South Korea (68.7%), Australia (125.4%) and Turkey (1298.7%), although the total volumes to these markets remain comparatively small. The majority of cars (54.9%) heading overseas went into the European Union, even though exports to the bloc declined by 2.7%.

UK production of battery electric (BEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and hybrid (HEV) cars rose by a fifth (20.3%) to a total of 24,115. In the year to date, UK car factories have produced a record 61,339 BEVs, up 16.2% on the same period in 2021.

Welcoming October’s growth, SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: “Getting the sector back on track in 2023 is a priority, given the jobs, exports and economic contribution the automotive industry sustains.

“UK car makers are doing all they can to ramp up production of the latest electrified vehicles, and help deliver net-zero, but more favourable conditions for investment are needed and needed urgently — especially in affordable and sustainable energy and availability of talent — as part of a supportive framework for automotive manufacturing.”"

What will be the price cap

'India to see it as an opportunity'

NEW DELHI: India has been a vital market for Russian crude oil after majority buyers in the West shunned purchases owing to Russia's war in Ukraine.The country is Asia’s second-biggest crude importer and actively purchases a range of grades from flagship Urals to oil shipped from the Far East -- ESPO and Sokol.With the Group of Seven (G7) nations' proposing a price cap of $65-$70 a barrel on Russian oil, it will be advantageous for countries like India, China and others major buyers who have been scrapping up discounted barrels ever since the US and its allies imposed sanctions on Russia.The existence of price cap would give them leverage to push down the price they pay to Russia.The Russia-Ukraine war has had a far-reaching impact on the global energy system, disrupting supply and demand patterns and fracturing long-standing trading relationships.It has pushed up energy prices for many consumers and businesses around the world, hurting households, industries and entire economies of several nations.The G7, including the United States, as well as the whole of the European Union and Australia, are planning to implement the price cap on sea-borne exports of Russian oil on December 5.The cap is intended to cut Russia's oil revenues while keeping Russian crude on the market by denying insurance, maritime services and finance provided by the Western allies for tanker cargoes priced above a fixed dollar-per barrel cap.A historical Russian Urals crude average of $63-64 a barrel could form an upper limit.The cap is a concept promoted by the United States since the EU first laid out plans in May for an embargo on Russian oil to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.Insurance companies and other firms needed to ship oil would only be able to deal with Russian crude if the oil is priced at or below the cap. Most of the insurers are located in the EU or the United Kingdom and could be required to participate in the cap. Without insurance, tanker owners may be reluctant to take on Russian oil and face obstacles in delivering it.G7 and European Union diplomats have been discussing a price cap on Russian oil of between $65 and $70 a barrel, but an agreement has still not been reached.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will not supply oil and gas to any countries that join in imposing the price cap, which the Kremlin.The price cap is expected to come into effect on December 5, same day when an EU ban on Russian crude kicks off, and ahead of the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, on December 4.However, the European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow's ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock.A higher price cap could make it attractive for Russia to continue to sell its oil, reducing the risk of a supply shortage in global oil markets.Poland wants the cap to be set at $30, arguing that with Russian production costs that some estimate at $20 per barrel, the G7 proposal would allow Moscow too much profit.Oil refiners in India have snapped up nearly all grades of Russian crude, taking advantage of the discounts. In fact, India has pushed into a corner of the Russian oil market once dominated by China.Six vessels hauling Russian crude known as ESPO were headed to refiners in the South Asian nation in August, according to traders and shipbrokers. That’s the highest number of cargoes purchased by India since the stream was introduced, and accounts almost one-fifth of available monthly shipments.As the conflict has dragged on, the third-largest oil importer first ramped up purchases of the flagship Urals crude, which loads from the western part of Russia, and is now competing for ESPO, a distillate-rich grade that comes from the east and was typically favored by Chinese buyers.Russia's share of India's oil imports surged to an all-time high of 23% from 19% the previous month while that of the Middle East declined to 56.4% from 59%, the data showed.Iraq remained India's top supplier while Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the second biggest after a gap of a month.According to a Reuters report, some refiners in India are paying the equivalent to a discount of around $25 to $35 a barrel to international benchmark Brent crude for Russian Urals crude.With Brent trading at around $86 a barrel on Friday, that would imply a price of $50-$60 a barrel of Urals, which is below the cap.Indian refiners typically pay for crude to be delivered to them, including insurance and freight.Even for delivered Urals crude, India is paying $15-$20 a barrel below Brent, one source said. That means even the delivered cargoes are about the same level as the price cap.Hence, Indian refiners are already getting Russian oil at below or near price cap levels. So, as and when the price caps are imposed it is unlikely to have any negative impact on India's oil imports.Urals is trading to other buyers at a similar discount of $30-$35 to dated Brent, trading sources said. Oil produced by the sanctioned state oil firm Rosneft is at the lower end and non-Rosneft slightly higher.According to a Reuters report, Indian refiners are wary of buying Russian crude beyond the December 5 date of the EU import ban and the proposed price cap.Leading refiners Reliance Industries and state-controlled Bharat Petroleum are pulling back from placing orders, according to two sources familiar with the purchasing plans.The lower volumes for December follow strong imports by India of Russian crude in recent months. Refinitiv estimates November arrivals at 1.0 million bpd, which would make Russia the top supplier for the month, ahead of Iraq's 960,000 bpd.India hopes to convert the current global oil challenges from the Ukraine crisis into an opportunity to secure affordable energy, oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, a day after the European Union failed to agree on a Russian oil price cap.""At this time, the worry is not about from where we will get energy,"" Puri said. ""It is a global challenge but we have and we will convert this into an opportunity. And I don't foresee any difficulty in procuring energy and securing at affordable prices.""The West has exempted Russian oil supplies via pipelines to Hungary and China, and exports from Sakhalin-2 projects to Japan. ""So the question arises that on whom this price cap will be imposed, if these three large exemptions are there,"" Puri said, indicating that the mechanism is aimed at supplies to India.Puri, however, said he was not concerned about disruption to oil supplies post-December 5, adding that India has been rapidly diversifying its crude sources and could buy more oil from the United States, Guyana and other nations in the coming years.Even though India has benefited tremendously from Russian oil imports, in recent months the profits squeezed due to Moscow limiting discounts, tighter sanctions kicking in and refiners lifting more term supplies.India is now turning to Africa and the Middle East instead of Russia due to higher freight rates.To secure supplies, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in September signed its first 6-month oil import deals with Brazil's Petrobras for 12 million barrels and Colombia's Ecopetrol for 6 million barrels.Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) has signed an initial deal with Petrobras as it seeks to diversify oil sources.IOC is also looking for more short-term supplies, including a contract for US oil, according to sources quoted by Reuters. IOC already has an annual deal that provides an option to buy 18 million barrels of US oil. Of these, IOC has already bought about 12 million barrels so far this year, they said.The sources also said that BPCL, which has already ramped up US oil purchases, is looking for more term contracts.Moreover, with Canadian heavy crude’s discount to West Texas Intermediate crude on the Gulf Coast expanding to a record, Indian refiners have opportunistically increased purchases.A total of 3.3 million barrels of Access Western Blend, a crude grade produced in the oil sands of Alberta, are scheduled to arrive in India next month after departing the US Gulf, according to Vortexa Ltd."
1073577799,20221125,"BBC Scotland bosses have been rapped after a broadcast of Reporting Scotland was found guilty of “bias against Brexit”.

The news programme was found to have presented an overly negative view of the impacts of the UK’s exit from the European Union during a broadcast in late 2021.

The BBC’s Executive Complaints Unit probed the Reporting Scotland broadcast after a viewer complained that “by focusing only on firms ‘apparently damaged’ by the new arrangements, it had conveyed an unbalanced view of the impact of Brexit”.

READ MORE: Officials asked to examine rules after 'dodgy Tory bevvy session' in Holyrood

The focus of the complaint was on a report from BBC Scotland’s business and economy editor, Douglas Fraser, on December 20, 2021.

The segment was introduced: “It's almost a year since the UK Government and European Union concluded a very long negotiation on the deal with which Britain then left the European single market.

“Brexit's advocates say there will be long term economic benefits, but it's been a tough year for some of the Scottish businesses most affected as our business and economy editor, Douglas Fraser, has been finding out.”

The ECU said it was “legitimate” for Fraser’s report to focus on the Scottish businesses which had been most affected by Brexit, but added: “However, a programme adopting such an approach should maintain impartiality by exploring other aspects of the topic within a reasonable timeframe, which had not happened in the case of Reporting Scotland.”

The BBC’s internal watchdog noted that Fraser had looked at sectors across the Scottish economy while preparing for the report, concluding that improving performance in some areas was for reasons other than Brexit.

The ECU upheld the complaint, concluding: “It is generally agreed however, that Brexit has had a differential effect, bearing hardest on the kind of small businesses featured in the report, so there was at least a need to reflect areas where its impact had been less negative, whether on this occasion or in an appropriately linked programme.”

The ECU said it had spoken to bosses at BBC Scotland about the report and “discussed” its conclusions with the programme makers.

It comes as the BBC also saw a complaint upheld about “pro-SNP bias” after it broadcast an extract from the book “Preventable: How a Pandemic Changed the World and How to Prevent the Next One” by Professor Devi Sridhar.

The contribution from Sridhar, a global health expert who advised the Scottish Government during the Covid pandemic, was deemed to have fallen “short of the BBC’s standards of impartiality” as it came just two weeks before the council elections.

Oil posted a third weekly loss as the European Union suspended talks over a Russian oil price cap amid disagreements between member states.

West Texas Intermediate futures fell 2.1 per cent to settle at US$76.28 a barrel after trading in a more than US$3 range on Friday. European diplomats remain locked in talks over how strict the cap should be, having previously proposed a range of US$65-US$70. Poland and the Baltics felt the cap was too generous to Russia and now diplomats have postponed discussions until Monday.

The cap talks come before an OPEC+ meeting early next month. Iraq and Saudi Arabia’s oil ministers met on Thursday and said the group could take further measures if required to achieve stability in the market.

Crude has declined in November, overturning the gains made in October after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed to reduce production. Mounting headwinds to crude demand have stemmed from China’s tighter economic lockdowns and fears of a U.S. recession.

“Our balances point to slight oversupply until the end of 1Q,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Martijn Rats and Amy Sergeant said in a note to clients. “For now, the oil market is faced with macroeconomic headwinds.”
• WTI for January delivery fell US$1.66 to settle at US$76.28 in New York
• There was no settlement on Thursday due to Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S.
• Brent for January settlement fell US$1.71 to settle at US$83.63

The price-cap plan forms part of the efforts by the EU and the Group of Seven to punish President Vladimir Putin for the invasion of Ukraine by reducing Moscow’s revenue, while at the same time allowing other states to continue imports. The introduction of a cap by western countries will “with high probability” have a negative effect on the energy market, Putin said."
1073589064,20221125,"Twitter has reportedly shut down its office in the de-facto capital of the European Union this week in a potential shot across the bow at the bloc over freedom of speech.

A showdown between the censorious European Union and the notionally pro-free speech Elon Musk may be brewing after the new Twitter chief reportedly shut down its office in Brussels this week.

According to a report from the Financial Times, the office was shut down after the departure of Dario La Nasa and Julia Mozer, who previously served as conduits between the company and Eurocrats as well as being in charge of Twitter’s digital policy in Europe.

While it is not clear at present why the two employees left the company, however, the move comes just one week after the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) finally came into force. The legislation grants Brussels more powers to police so-called ‘hate speech’, while also enacting punishment mechanisms against internet platforms that fail to abide by the bloc’s rules.

Should a company such as Twitter refuse to comply with the DSA by February of 2024, the EU will be able to impose fines of up to six per cent of their global revenue and even possibly ban the platform altogether.

Speaking to the FT, the EU’s vice-president for disinformation, Věra Jourová said: “I am concerned about the news of firing such a vast amount of staff of Twitter in Europe. If you want to effectively detect and take action against disinformation and propaganda, this requires resources.

“Especially in the context of Russian disinformation warfare, I expect Twitter to fully respect the EU law and honour its commitments. Twitter has been a very useful partner in the fight against disinformation and illegal hate speech and this must not change.”

Though Mr Musk has claimed that he hopes to facilitate the social media site to return to its pro-free speech routes, he has already made some concessions, including maintaining a regime of shadow-banning posts and accounts that spread supposedly hateful messages. He has also stated that he will not allow controversial InfoWars host Alex Jones to return to the platform.

Prior to his takeover of the company in May, Musk met with the European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton, who was the driving force behind the introduction of the DSA. During the meeting, the billionaire tech boss said that he was “exactly aligned” with the philosophy of the EU on censorship.

Perhaps reminding him of this commitment, upon Musk’s official takeover, Breton said: “In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules.”"

""Now leaving rainy Vienna for important meetings in Baku,"" the tweet said.

The European Union (EU) and Azerbaijan cooperate in different sectors of the economy.

Azerbaijan prioritizes equal and mutually beneficial cooperation with the European Union. In 2021, Azerbaijan and the EU had a trade turnover of $15.2 billion. At the same time, from 2012 to 2021, the EU invested more than $21.5 billion in Azerbaijan's economy.

As part of its economic investment plan, the European Union has provided Azerbaijan with a €2 billion financial package.

The EU and Azerbaijan are in active dialogue on increasing gas supplies amid the energy crisis.

A joint statement on energy cooperation with the EU had been signed more than ten years ago. The EU-Azerbaijan energy cooperation had reached a new level and is still ongoing within the framework of the Southern Gas Corridor. The EU places a high value on energy supply diversification, and the Southern Gas Corridor is particularly important in this regard. In 2021, European countries purchased 8.2 billion cubic meters of gas, with an increase in volume expected in the coming years.

MOSCOW. Nov 25 (Interfax) - The volume of financing de facto provided to Ukraine by international partners since the start of the military action to cover the state budget deficit reached $25.731 billion as of November 24, the Ukrainian media reported, citing the Ukrainian Finance Ministry.

Another $1 billion was received for rebuilding, the reports said.

In total, that reached 71% of the declared international assistance worth a total of $37.581 billion, the ministry said.

According to data on its site, grants account for 39.2% of the received funding ($10.49 billion).

The United States and the European Union planned to provide the most support to Ukraine, $12.99 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively. Of that amount, the U.S. provided $8.49 billion, or 65% all in the form of grants, and the EU provided $7.367 billion, or 64%, of which grants accounted only for $626 million.

Among the largest donor for promised assistance are the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Canada with $2.71 billion, $2.32 billion and $2.021 billion, respectively. The IMF provided all of the declared funds, whereas the EIB and Canada provided $1.72 billion and $1.521 billion, respectively. All funds were provided in the form of loans. The EIB is currently the only donor hat has provided funding for rebuilding.

They are followed by the World Bank, Germany and the United Kingdom with $1.765 billion, $1.373 billion and $1.076 billion, respectively. Germany and the UK provided grants amounting to $1.049 billion and $128 million respectively. These countries have already provided all of the declared funds, whereas the World Bank has only provided 56%.

Japan is also a donor to Ukraine budget. It has provided $581 million, and this money has already been received in the form of loans.

France has declared support to the Ukrainian budget in an amount of $432 million (77% of it has already come through), Italy and the Netherlands provided $332 million and $330 million, respectively (including Italy's grant of $125 million). Italy has provided all of the money, and the Netherlands has provided one-third - $106 million.

Nine other countries promised to provide in total $172.5 million, of which $149.5 million has already come through, including $80.5 million in the form of grants.

The National Bank of Ukraine covered the state budget deficit in an equivalent of $11.246 billion by direct buyout of ""military"" bonds.

According to data from the Finance Ministry and the government, the monthly need for state budget deficit financing reaches some $5 billion this year. Next year, the government plans to reduce the state budget deficit to $3-4 billion a month (in total $38 billion a year), counting on its financing by the U.S., the IMF and the EU, and also to draw $17 billion for emergency recovery."

1073598667,20221125,"The Bahamas may have “some light on the horizon” in its tax battles against the European Union (EU) and Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) via a new United Nations (UN) resolution.

The resolution, voted on Wednesday, paves the way to potentially wrest control of international tax policy from the OECD and developed countries by creating a pathway for a UN convention on taxation and a new global tax body.

This is something present Cabinet ministers such as Alfred Sears KC, minister of works and utilities, have been urging for years while in private practice as it would provide a fairer forum for resolving tax-related disputes and potentially blunt the ‘blacklisting’ and ‘naming and shaming’ tactics employed by the likes of the EU to force The Bahamas to change its laws and undermine financial services competitiveness.

Paul Moss, president of Dominion Management Services, one of the few Bahamian-owned businesses in the international financial services sector, told Tribune Business that while it was a promising development he remained sceptical that any good will come from it until the UN and smaller nations “show they’re not going to be bullied” by developed countries.

“It quite possibly could be the answer so long as the UN is not hijacked by some old OECD players,” he said. “If this could be on the basis of one country, one vote, that would be great but it remains to be seen. Obviously the EU and OECD are biased in their approach to this whole issue, and everything they do and recommend is against international financial centres (IFCs).

“This will certainly be a welcome sight because we spread it across all the countries who potentially have an equal say in what happens. What happens today is that the OECD and EU force us to change our laws, and we all go marching down to the gallows to change them.

“But if the UN operates as it should be, and countries have their own impact, perhaps we’d get a fairer approach as opposed to being forced to change our laws. I’m not confident in that. There has to be some demonstration by the United Nations (UN) to show they’re not going to be bullied themselves. I’m not confident till I see that.”

International reports said the vote on a UN tax mandate was heavily opposed by the US and major developed countries, which are reluctant to lose control of a global tax policy debate they have dominated for decades to the detriment of The Bahamas and other IFCs.

While there is merit to Mr Moss’ concerns, he added: “It does represent progress; there’s no question. When you look back 22 years to when we were first blacklisted, there’s now some light on the horizon. But we have procrastinated and missed the mark by not forming our own alliance against the OECD and EU.

“This may be an opportunity for IFCs to get together and form a group so that when this happens they will be united, and there will be more IFCs than the G-7, so we will have a substantial say in what goes on. Whenever we have been blacklisted we have ended up changing our laws, even if it goes against our constitution. It doesn’t matter to us; we change it.

“We’re too late in standing up, but I’m not sure it’s too late in allowing the UN to have a stab at it. Everyone wanted to fight it their own way, deal with it their own way, and at the end of the day we played right into their [OECD and EU] hands. It was divide and conquer.”

The UN resolution was presented by African nations, with those countries wanting an international agreement on measures such as a floor for corporate tax rates, so countries cannot undercut one another, and forcing multinationals to report how much tax they pay in each country.

António Guterres, the UN secretary general, now has to write a report on the problems in the global tax system. “History was made today. We commend UN members on their bold action today to move rule-making on global tax into the daylight of democracy at the UN,” said Alex Cobham, chief executive at the Tax Justice Network, in a statement.

“The inter-governmental discussions next year will be crucial in setting the path for this new era of international tax. It is vital that countries in each region of the world follow the African leadership that underpinned this success, and engage together to generate common positions on an ambitious agenda.”"
1073598669,20221125,"The European Parliament is demanding new steps. After declaring Russia as a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" Wednesday, MEPs want to acknowledge, more congruently, the atrocities Russia has committed in Ukraine.

During the monthly plenary session in Strasbourg, MEPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of the symbolic resolution – with 494 voting for the motion.

The result could clear the way for MEPs to hold Moscow and Russian president Vladimir Putin accountable for alleged war crimes during their invasion of Ukraine.

""What we voted today, Russia is a terrorist state, means an example to all dictators like Putin. Think twice whenever you want to do something like this, because there are other dictators in the world other than Putin thinking about doing something like this,” Vlad Gheorghe Romanian MEP with Renew Europe told The Global Conversation.

Sándor Zsiros, Euronews: Vlad Gheorghe. What does it mean for the future that the European Parliament now calls Russia a state sponsor of terrorism? Does that bring the end of the conflict any closer?

Vlad Gheorghe, Romanian MEP, Renew Europe: First of all, we recognise what everyone knows. What do you call a state that attacks citizens that is guilty of over 40,000 documented war crimes and a state that tries to kill civilians by freezing them to death or starving them. This is what we said now in the European Parliament that we see this and we acknowledge politically this.

SZ: Mr. Lagodinsky, do you think that Russia will be ever added to the EU's official terrorist list?

**Sergey Lagodinsky, German MEP, Greens/EFA:**I think we're not there yet. I see this resolution mostly as a political statement and an important sign of solidarity and also of acknowledgement that the conduct of Russia, number one, and this is how the resolution takes it: number one, Russia employs terrorist behaviour. And number two, Russia employs terrorists unit. If we talk about the Wagner Brigade, for example, or if we talk about some units of the Chechen so-called Chechen army, I would say that their behaviour is terrorist and Russia is a sponsor of those. So from that perspective, we are on the safe side, but we do not have a legal instrumentarium to deal with this in the European Union or on the international stage, except for the United States. So one of the calls in this resolution is to try to develop something like this until we have a solid legal ground. This will be quite difficult to actually derive conclusions from what we're doing in the legal realm.

SZ: And the resolution also calls for the frozen Russian assets to be transferred to help Ukraine. How would that work in reality?

VG: Every decision that we take, it needs to be based in law, and we are now writing that legislation in order for us to be able to get the Russian assets first for rebuilding Ukraine, because we need to start rebuilding Ukraine before the war ends because the people there need it. And second, to reimburse what our budgets have supported so far.

SZ: This is actually a very interesting point that you said that we need to respect rule of law, because one of the pillars of the Western civilisation is respect for private property or respect for state property. Is it a violation of this pillar?

SL: We both are rapporteurs on confiscation of assets, private assets from oligarchs or mafia people in the European Union that we will be discussing and negotiating in the Parliament. For that, you need someone who have committed a crime. You need someone where there is a link between him and the assets, etc., etc. So we are trying to find a rule of law-based way to this goal. Regarding the state assets there is a long way to go there. There is a so-called immunity of state assets which is recognised by international law, but there can be of course exceptions and we should start talking to the international community on whether such an exception we have here.

**VG:**And the long term goal is of course to find legal ways, as Sergei put it before me, to find legal ways of getting the Russian assets where they need to be to be put actually into rebuilding Ukraine. Because one last thing, because we have €40 billion in private assets and around 400 billion in state assets. So it's a pretty big difference.

SZ: Now, the European Parliament also calls for a new round of sanctions against Russia. What should be included? And do you think it's time to have them now?

VG: Yes, I think it's time to have them now. I think it's a it's a perfect example to all the dictators, exactly like what we did today, because what we voted today, Russia is a terrorist state, means an example to all dictators like Putin: Think twice whenever you want to do something like this, because there are other dictators in the world other than Putin thinking about doing something like this. And yes, we need to to have more sanctions. And, yes, we need to think about a price cap for Russian oil and Russian gas, which are very important as complementary sanctions. But also very important for the life of Europeans now, because Putin is playing a war of energy prices and we need to react on that.

SZ: How should the European Union keep support for its current policies towards Ukraine?

SL: I think it's of course, a matter of helping between member states. We will be not able to sustain this winter and to give much-needed social and financial help to the citizens if member states do not help each other. And that's why I do think that we will not be able to avoid getting more mutual debt as the European Union in order to have a solidarity fund that would help member states. We are not nation-states. We do not give welfare directly to citizens. But I think supporting citizens in terms of social support and economic support to enterprises should be a priority this winter. This is important, but to be honest, our burdens, as much as I understand our burdens, are not comparable to the burdens of Ukrainians who are being also killed, tortured and raped right now. So I think we should also see that we still have the privilege of living in peace as opposed to our neighbours who are being attacked.

SZ: Vlad Gheorghe, the same question goes to you.

VG: I'm going to continue Sergei's answer. Peace is priceless. You simply cannot put a price on peace. This is unbelievably needed for all the people. We are Europeans. We have it. Now we understand how to appreciate that more because we have a war at our borders. So, yeah, of course, we need to do more for our citizens, for our European citizens. And I am very, very sure that our citizens will continue to be 100% in solidarity with the Ukrainians as they showed. So remember, the European citizens were the first to react to the war, not the European states. And lastly, we as a union, we are as strong as the link between our states. So this is our strength, our solidarity and our unity. If we lose that, we lose everything to Putin.

SZ: Thanks very much to both of you for the interview.

**VG:**Thank you very much."
1073598670,20221125,"Entering the European Union is about to get more complicated for non-EU nationals from next year.

A new Entry Exit System (EES) is set to come into effect from May 2023.

This is part of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) that will be implemented later next year.

It will require visitors from outside the EU to apply and pay for a visa waiver before entering a country in the Schengen zone.

Here’s how European countries are preparing for the changes and how you might be able to avoid visa fees.

What are the EES and ETIAS?

The EU’s new EES will register additional information about non-EU travellers to the bloc.

Beyond passport details, automated barriers at borders will take and store biometric data includingfingerprints and facial images.

Passport stamps will be scrapped. Instead, the system will automatically register when someone enters or leaves an EU country.

This will make it easier to flag someone who has overstayed their time in the EU.

Non-EU citizens, which includes UK nationals post-Brexit, can only stay 90 days in the EU before requiring a visa.

The EES does not apply to EU citizens or to people travelling between Schengen zone countries.

How do you apply for the ETIAS?

The wider ETIAS will come into effect in November 2023. This will require non-EU nationals to pay €7 per person to visit most European countries.

The visa permits non-EU citizens to stay in the EU and Schengen zone for 90 days. Once a traveller has had their visa approved, they do not need to apply again for three years.

The visa will not be required for the Republic of Ireland as it is in the Common Travel Area.

This is a zone of open borders comprising the United Kingdom, Ireland, Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.

Travellers will have to complete an online application before they go and pay the €7 fee if they are between 18 and 70 years old.

Do I need a visa if I have a European identity card?

Non-EU nationals who have official residency in an EU country may be exempt from the EES and ETIAS.

You need to have a biometric identity card, such as the carte de séjour in France or the carta di soggiorno in Italy.

These mean that you are also exempt from the 90-day limit.

However, no information has been released on how the automated barriers at borders would identify a traveller as an EU resident when using a non-EU passport.

What will the EES barriers look like?

EU countries are preparing to install automated barriers to carry out the EES checks.

France will install self-service kiosks at airports where travellers can pre-register their biometric data and personal details. They will then present themselves to a border guard for verification.

Germany and Austria have confirmed a similar system will be installed at airports.

For visitors arriving by car at France’s land and sea borders, tablet devices will be available to register your details.

Italy has said it will increase the number of automated gates in all its main airports as well as adding around 600 self-service kiosks.

Norway, on the other hand, will trial “automated camera solutions” operated by the border guards.

As the EU prepares to introduce the digital barrier system, there are fears it will cause disruption at borders.

Several countries have said they feel there is insufficient time to test the more rigorous checks before they come into force.

Even travellers with EU residency may find themselves caught up in delays.

A document released by the EU council last week shares comments from various EU nations about the new system.

Austria and Germany were particularly concerned that border wait times could rise.

“The additional tasks resulting from the EES regulation will lead to a sharp increase in process times,” Austrian authorities said.

“Currently, we expect process times to double compared to the current situation.”

Will EU countries be ready for the EES?

Questions have also been raised about whether the physical infrastructure of the barriers will be installed in time.

German authorities have admitted that “a stable working EES system seems to be unlikely in May 2023.”

Austrian authorities have said they are working to create more space for automated kiosks but will not be finished before the system is operational.

European Union authorities have already issued a warning to non-EU nationals to be aware of fraudulent websites offering ETIAS visas.

They say scammers may make copy cat websites or offer intermediary services.

These websites would defraud users by falsely charging an additional administration fee.

EU officials stress that travellers should only use the official ETIAS site. This hasn’t been set up yet but will use the “europa.eu” domain."

CAFC Denies Mandamus to Sound View, Allowing Reexamination to Proceed – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) on Tuesday denied a petition requesting mandamus relief to vacate the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO’s) grant of a request for ex parte reexamination of Sound View Innovations’ U.S. Patent No. 6,708,213 by DISH Network LLC. DISH originally petitioned the USPTO for inter partes review (IPR) of claim 16 of the ‘213 patent on the ground that it was anticipated and/or obvious based on two prior art references called Sen and Geagen. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) denied the petition, finding that DISH had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood that Sen and Geagan taught the claimed step of “adjusting a data transfer rate.” DISH subsequently petitioned the USPTO for ex parte reexamination of claim 16, adding a new reference, and the PTAB granted the request, finding that the combination of the three references “raised a substantial new question of patentability.” The CAFC ultimately held that “mandamus relief is unavailable because a post-final decision appeal is an adequate remedy by which Sound View may seek to obtain relief based on its § 325(d) challenge.”

Seventh Circuit Finds No Publicity Violation by Sale of Magazine Subscriber List – On Tuesday, November 22, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a ruling in Huston v. Hearst Communications, Inc. in which the appellate court affirmed a lower court’s ruling that Hearts Communications did not violate Huston’s right of publicity under Illinois state law by selling magazine subscriber lists containing her contact information. The Seventh Circuit held that Hearst did not hold out Huston’s identity as part of the company’s commercial purpose to sell Good Housekeeping subscriptions, thus Huston failed to state a claim under the state publicity statute.

Alia Moses Takes Over as Chief Judge of the Western District of Texas – On Friday, November 18, U.S. District Judge Alia Moses officially assumed her duties as the Chief Judge of the Western District of Texas. Many patent law industry insiders expect that the change, which was discussed during an IPWatchdog LIVE panel this September, could presage changes to the order on equitable distribution of patent cases within Western Texas that was issued this summer by Judge Moses’ predecessor, outgoing Chief Judge Orlando L. Garcia, which has been seen as unfairly targeting the patent docket of U.S. District Judge Alan D. Albright at Western Texas’ Waco Division.

EUIPO Board of Appeal Overturns Invalidation of Banksy Trademark – On Monday, November 14, the European Union Intellectual Property Office’s (EUIPO) Fifth Board of Appeal publicized a ruling that reversed an EUIPO decision from May 2021 canceling a trademark registration owned by the anonymous UK artist Banksy. While the EUIPO’s Cancellation Division had invalidated Banksy’s registration as being filed in bad faith, the Board of Appeal found nothing in Banksy’s public statements against copyright law that suggested the artist intended to protect the mark as copyright without having to file a copyright registration, which would require Banksy to disclose their identity.

USPTO Issues Info Collections on PTAs, Reissue Applications, Biological Deposits – On Tuesday, November 22, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office announced a trio of information collections in the Federal Register related to deposits of biological materials, legal processes surrounding employment actions and claims, and requests for certificates of correction and reissue applications.

1073601379,20221125,"A HIGH-POWERED delegation of military officers led by Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) Air Vice Marshall Biltim Chingono was in Pakistan this month to inspect modern aircraft and armaments during a defence exhibition where deals worth millions of United States dollars were sealed, the Zimbabwe Independent can reveal.

Chingono, alongside an elite group of AFZ and Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) officers, were in Karachi between November 15 and November 18, 2022, for the world-acclaimed International Defence Exhibition and Seminar (Ideas).

Over 30 contracts were signed during the exhibition held in the Asian country.

The top global military exhibition, which showcases an array of advanced armaments “provides a perfect interactive platform to defence forces and governments to access the best products and technology to meet their security and defence-related needs,” its website states.

Organised by the Pakistan Defence Export Promotion Organisation, the global arms exhibition has evolved since its inception to be regarded as “an established rendezvous for convergence of international defence exhibitors, delegates, security analysts and top-level policy planners”.

Relating to the Zimbabwean crew which attended the premier global military exhibition, Chingono was accompanied by Air Commodore Pio Maketo among other Air Force officers as evidence gleaned by the Independent shows.

The presence of the Zimbabwean high-level delegation in nuclear-armed Pakistan which neighbours India comes a year after Mnangagwa’s official helicopter crash-landed due to a technical problem while some of the military unit’s aircrafts have been involved in accidents.

Broadly, the accidents have been triggered by hostile weather, technical faults and in some cases human error.

Zimbabwe’s Air Force, widely regarded as one of the best in the region had some of its aircraft damaged and destroyed during the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) war from 1998-2002.

Zimbabwe’s costly intervention in the war as part of Operation Sovereign Legitimacy (Osleg) primarily meant to keep at bay Western-sponsored rebels angling to topple the resource-rich country’s leader Laurent Kabila.

During the Karachi defense exhibition, which was attended by 524 arms manufacturers from 44 countries, which also included China, Russia and Belarus, the Chingono-led team inspected a fleet of JF-17 aircraft and drones, among other armaments that were on display raising expectations that Zimbabwe would soon place orders.

Security and defense sources told the Independent last week that Zimbabwe’s presence at the Ideas expo, which returned after a four year Covid-19 induced hiatus indicated that “Harare’s short-term and long-term plans to steadily improve its aircraft and armaments are in line with modern technological advancements”.

During the highly subscribed military exhibition, the Zimbabwean team also held meetings with the Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

As first revealed by this publication in 2020, Zimbabwe, reeling from Western-imposed sanctions is now predominantly procuring its armaments from Eastern Europe and countries in Asia including Pakistan.

The United States (US) and European Union (EU) have since 2001 maintained sanctions on the Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI), the country’s arms manufacturer.

To understand whether the Southern African country placed orders to buy armaments from the exhibiting manufacturers and the primary objective of the team’s visit, questions sent to the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) Public Relations director Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mutes were referred to the Air Force.

Air Force Wing Commander Donovan Muroyiwa said he was “consulting” when the Independent asked him the same questions.

Questions related to the same subject posed to Defence minister Oppah Muchinguri primarily meant to understand whether Zimbabwe was considering strengthening its fleet of aircraft and armaments by acquisitions were not addressed before going to press.

Questions sent to organisers of the Ideas exhibition in Pakistan also drew blanks.

Leveraging on its motto “Alæ Præsidio Patriæ” which translates to: “Our wings are the fortress of the nation,” Zimbabwe’s Air Force has scored major victories in various missions including Mozambique and DRC. Within Zimbabwe’s borders, it has been deployed to carry out life-saving evacuation operations.

The Pakistan exhibition showcased a wide array of military hardware which was classified in nine (9) distinct groups which included (i) weapons, ammunition, turret, (ii) vehicles, aircraft and drones, (iii)battlefield management, (iv)training and simulation, (v)special equipment and engineering services, (vi) industrial and logistic support, (vii)naval ships and submarines, (vii)industry sectors, (ix) services.

Under the arms, weapons and turrets category, exhibiting firms displayed air defence systems, anti-tank wall breaching systems and close defence weapons while the vehicles, aircraft and drone category showcased main battle tank variants, light armoured and un armoured vehicles and vehicle engines and transmission systems.

In 2019, while on an official visit to Belarus where Zimbabwe reportedly finalised deals worth US$350 million spanning across various sectors, Mnangagwa toured the Volat plant, also known as OJSC MZKT, that manufactures a range of military hardware and directly falls under the State Military Industrial Committee.

At that time, Volat indicated that the President was exposed to a wide spectrum of military hardware.

In October this year, the government took delivery of a specialised medical helicopter and ambulance from Russia, in a diplomatic gesture that demonstrated Harare and Moscow’s solid bilateral ties.

The 2020 Sipri report, which offered a rare glimpse into how Zimbabwe has bolstered its arsenal, highlighted that the southern African country shelled US$647 million from 1980 to 2020 in declared arms purchases.

Strikingly, Sipri’s report shows that the US has not exported weapons to Zimbabwe since the country’s independence in 1980.

The security think-tank’s report indicates that in 2000, Harare took delivery of a fleet of six MI-24P combat helicopter gunships from Russia for US$22 million.

Before 2000, when Zimbabwe still enjoyed relatively cordial relations with the West, Sipri’s report shows that the country purchased six (6) SF.260 jet aircraft from Italy in 1998 and 23 units of Almat APC (armoured personnel carriers) from France in 1996 at a cumulative cost of US$15 million."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices fell 2% on Friday in thin market liquidity, closing a week marked by worries about Chinese demand and haggling over a Western price cap on Russian oil.

Brent crude futures settled down $1.71, or 2%, to trade at $83.63 a barrel, having retraced some earlier gains.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down $1.66, or 2.1%, at $76.28 a barrel. There was no WTI settlement on Thursday due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and trading volumes remained low.

""Because there's light volume after the holiday, we're giving up some of the gains here a bit,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures group.

Both contracts posted their third consecutive weekly declines after hitting 10-month lows this week. Brent ended the week down 4.6%, while WTI fell 4.7%.

Brent and WTI's market structure implies current demand is softening, with backwardation, defined by front-month prices trading above contracts for later delivery, having weakened markedly in recent sessions.

For two-month spreads, Brent and WTI's structures even dipped into contango this week, implying oversupply with near-term delivery contracts priced below later deliveries.

China, the world's top oil importer, on Friday reported a new daily record for COVID-19 infections, as cities across the country continued to enforce mobility measures and other curbs to control outbreaks.

This is starting to hit fuel demand, with traffic drifting down and implied oil demand around 1 million barrels per day lower than average, an ANZ note showed.

Meanwhile, G7 and European Union diplomats have been discussing a Russian oil price cap between $65 and $70 a barrel, but an agreement has still not been reached. A meeting of European Union government representatives, scheduled for Friday evening to discuss the proposal, was cancelled, EU diplomats said.

The aim is to limit revenue to fund Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine without disrupting global oil markets, but the proposed level is broadly in line with what Asian buyers are already paying.

Poland is seeking German support to slap EU sanctions on the Polish-German section of the Druzhba crude pipeline so Warsaw can abandon a deal to buy Russian oil next year without paying penalties, two sources familiar with the talks said.

Trading is expected to remain cautious ahead of an agreement on the price cap, due to come into effect on Dec. 5 when an EU ban on Russian crude kicks off, and ahead of the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies on Dec. 4."
1073603637,20221125,"On November 17-18, over 400 smallholder farmers gathered for the 27th annual meeting of MVIWATA or the National Network of Small-Scale Farmers Groups in Tanzania. Peoples Dispatch spoke to them about their struggle for dignity and justice

Hundreds of smallholder farmers gathered in the city of Morogoro on November 17 and 18 for the 27th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Mtandao wa Vikundi vya Wakulima Tanzania or the National Network of Small-Scale Farmers Groups in Tanzania (MVIWATA).

The organization was founded in 1993 by self-organized farmers in the wake of the country’s first Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) under the IMF and the World Bank between 1986 to 1989. The neoliberal reforms ushered in during this period marked an absolute departure from Tanzania’s centrally-planned economy under socialist president and leading anti-colonial figure Julius K. Nyerere.

In 1967, Nyerere issued the Arusha Declaration, committing Tanzania to the principles of socialism and self-reliance and paving the way for nationalization of key industries and the collectivization of agriculture.

“The peasantry and the workers were declared as the engines of the Tanzanian economy, there was massive state investment geared towards them. Farmers were depending on the government and selling their produce through cooperatives,” Theodora Pius, the Head of Program at MVIWATA, told Peoples Dispatch.

However, this changed with the withdrawal of the state in the SAP-era reforms. At the same time, Pius added, while there were strong cooperatives of farmers growing cotton, tea, and coffee, other farmers growing maize and small grains were not a part of these collectives. Under these circumstances, MVIWATA was born.

“Groups of farmers came together and decided that they would travel throughout Tanzania to call on peasants to unite and have a unified voice, to demand their inclusion in national policies, to demand better prices for our produce, and to provide alternatives on agricultural extension services. It was their dream to ensure that MVIWATA goes to every village in Tanzania,” Pius said.

MVIWATA has organized farmers stretching from groups at the grassroots all the way to a national network as the issues that it was founded to address three decades ago continue to persist in Tanzania today.

“The system that oppressed the farmers in the late 80s and the 90s is the same today, it has just changed faces. Our priorities have remained the same, we continue to speak on issues of land, on markets, on access to finance – just the context has changed,” Pius said. In response, MVIWATA has continued to update its strategies.

Leading up to this year’s meeting, the organization developed its 2022-2026 strategic plans, identifying six areas of priority. The first is to “retain the dignity of the farmers as a class.” The second area is agroecology and food sovereignty. “The agribusiness model has been used against our people, our rights, and the planet. This model has taken away our land, our seeds, our culture and our dignity,” Pius said.

“Agroecology and food sovereignty is an alternative system which tells us that farmers can produce in a just system that respects the rights of the producers and the consumers, the environment and biodiversity. It tells us that we can produce keeping in mind that food is a right, not just a mere product to be sold.”

In contrast, there has been a proliferation of agribusiness, Pius explained, with villages being told that conventional farming and agribusiness were the “missing link” for wealth creation for farmers.

MVIWATA is also organizing extensively around land rights and security amid growing evictions, land grabbing, land speculation, and with farmers not having access to land.

“Every day there are reports of evictions, of people being told to vacate their villages and move. The pressure of capital is pushing people from their lands. This is taking place under the guise of investments for the ‘national benefit’ but also through other, formalized means. The majority of people facing these evictions are farmers in rural areas,” Pius stated. “If a farmer is evicted but they want to remain on their land, they are allowed to stay but only if they cultivate particular crops wanted by the investors.”

Among the resolutions adopted at the AGM, farmers committed to strengthening their unity and advocacy for land issues, “especially in the Mbarali district where 21,000 farmers are facing threat of eviction,” she said.

Farmers also deliberated on existing legal mechanisms and how they can be used to ensure land security, and how MVIWATA could work to reduce conflicts among small scale producers on issues of land use as “access to land continues to shrink.”

Another key area of focus for MVIWATA is economic justice. “Farmers are producing under very difficult conditions and then when they go to sell their produce in the market the price they get is very low. Farmers do not have money to buy inputs, so the middlemen come in and offer some amount of money. When it is time to harvest, these middlemen take everything without regard to the existing market price,” she said.

In response, MVIWATA is trying to build savings and credit groups of farmers, and mechanisms and systems to ensure that farmers are getting a fair price, including through the collective selling of their produce. Resolutions adopted at the AGM also included a focus on strengthening financial services and cooperative groups for farmers.

“Organizations like MVIWATA are articulating a people’s answer to land, food, and agrarian questions,” Jonis Ghedi-Alasow, a member of Pan-Africanism Today and an international delegate at the MVIWATA meeting, told Peoples Dispatch. “They have demonstrated that the peasants of Tanzania are not only feeding the country, but are also, when organized, able to insist on a fundamental break with neocolonialism.”

Prior to the AGM on November 18, MVIWATA organized a workshop titled ‘The Future of Small-Scale Farmers in the Context of Investment and Free Market in Tanzania’ with three areas of focus – land, seeds, and markets.

“The workshop saw several strong interventions – one, that farmers must produce products that can make them independent. This requires producing for the local market,” Ghedi-Alasow stated.

“In the past, solidarity among peasants in the global South made it possible to sell produce beyond our own countries without having to pay tariffs. There is a commitment to rebuilding these links of solidarity among peasants, particularly in Africa, to fight against debilitating tariffs on products that peasants are, in fact, exporting.”

He added that there is also a renewed commitment to using local seeds, including from seed banks. At the AGM, farmers resolved to advocate for increased budgetary allocations towards agriculture aligned with the priorities of smallholder farmers along with pushing for a change in existing seed laws to also include local seeds.

Farmers also pledged to continue to fight evictions and the so-called ‘investors’. “The government is not the leadership, the people are the leadership. This is why they come back every five years to ask for our votes,” declared Veronica Sofu, one of the leaders at the forefront of this struggle.

Farmers also discussed external trade agreements, particularly the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the East African Community (EAC). Tanzania is a member of the EAC. While it has yet to sign the agreement, the AGM discussed its potential impact on farmers.

MVIWATA is also organizing around issues of gender justice, with a focus on peasant feminism, including developing actions to end violence against women and strategizing with women in rural areas. On International Women’s Day in March, MVIWATA and Pan Africanism Today had organized a workshop to discuss peasant feminism, which was attended by leaders from across Africa.

The organization also works with the youth, educating them on agroecology, self-reliance, and political economy.

“When we speak of the system that oppresses the farmers in Tanzania, it is the same system that oppresses farmers in Bangladesh, in South Africa, in Namibia,” Pius said. “If the forces that oppress us are joined together why mustn’t we come together to forge solidarity and counterattack?”

MVIWATA has been committed to the principle of Pan-Africanism, engaging with movements and organizations across the continent.

Speaking to Peoples Dispatch, Mercy Dedaa Osei, a member of the Socialist Movement of Ghana (SMG), affirmed that MVIWATA was an “important instrument for Pan-Africanist struggles because it is entrenched in defining a peoples answer to the land, food, and peasant questions not just in Tanzania but Africa and the rest of the world.”

“It is creating a platform to bring together voices against the mass exploitation of peasants…It is imperative to solidarize, work, learn, agitate and grow together into a powerful force in the fight for the rights of peasant farmers.”

“Our slogan ‘the defender of the farmer is the farmer’ was coined by a farmer from West Africa who had been invited to one of our meetings,” Pius said. “Pan-Africanism is embedded in the history, the present, and the future of MVIWATA. We must come together not just in times of crisis but also to build our strategies together.”

“Pan-Africanism is, at its core, concerned with a struggle for sovereignty. One aspect of this struggle is, of course, anchored in securing political and economic freedom for the African people, the diaspora, and the working peoples of the world. Another important aspect of this struggle is concerned with people providing for themselves. Africa has an abundance of natural wealth, yet we are a continent facing one of the highest levels of hunger,” Ghedi-Alasow added."

1073608272,20221125,"Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary supports NATO membership for Finland and Sweden. Orbán announced this during a meeting of the Visegrad 4 group of countries (Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia).

The Visegrad 4 group differs significantly about the crisis between Ukraine and pro-Russian indigenous forces in the Donbass (Donbas) region backed by the armed forces of the Russian Federation. Hungary is more nuanced toward the Russian Federation – in the other direction, Poland openly supports Ukraine.

However, Visegrad 4 nations must solve differences because they share common interests. This notably applies to furthering economic integration, preventing illegal immigration, securing energy supplies, and reinforcing border protection.

Orbán declared, “On NATO, I can tell you that the government has already made a decision. We have already confirmed to both Finland and Sweden that Hungary supports the membership of these two countries in NATO, and at the first session of next year, Parliament will put this on the agenda.”

Orbán continued, “I would like to underline that the Swedes and the Finns have not lost a single minute of membership because of Hungary, and Hungary will certainly give them the support they need to join. After the government, so will Parliament.”

Hungary Today reports, “According to observers, the Hungarian government is putting pressure on Europe on three fronts: it opposes a joint borrowing to support Ukraine (and wants to support its neighbor bilaterally), opposes the global minimum tax, and it is in no hurry to ratify the two Nordic countries’ NATO membership.”

Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland said in early November, “All eyes are now on Hungary and Turkey. We are waiting for these countries to ratify our applications. I think it would be important that this would happen preferably sooner than later.”

NATO’s main obstacle to the membership of Finland and Sweden is Turkey supporting both nations – along with the internal concern in Sweden related to Kurds and other humanitarian factors. Hence, human rights issues and the extradition of Kurds to Turkey might set off internal political convulsions in Sweden.

Pierre Schori – a close confidant of the esteemed former Social Democrat Premier Olof Palme (assassinated in 1986)– weighed in. He said, r Erdogan, a shame for Sweden – and a betrayal of Kurdish freedom fighters. It is a shock for many Social Democrats.”

Paul Levin, the director of the Institute for Turkish Studies at Stockholm University, said, “Sweden has been a thorn in Turkey’s side, criticizing Turkish human rights abuses, there is a strong and vibrant Kurdish diaspora in Sweden, parts of which is sympathetic to the PKK… All these things fly in the face of the Turkish perspective on these issues that the PKK and their affiliates are an essential national security threat to Turkey.”

In 2017, Modern Tokyo Times said, “Purges in Turkey against alleged supporters of the cleric Fethullah Gulen – to suppressing Kurdish politicians – and enormous intimidation against Kurdish associations that merely question the leadership of Erdogan – are never-ending. Indeed, while people conjure up images of mass political purges in nations like North Korea – to history in China under Mao Zedong – then no need to read history books or focus on Northeast Asia. Instead, just focus on the power concentration policies of NATO Turkey under Erdogan and his endless internal attacks against Kurds, Gulen supporters, socialists, or anyone who dares to challenge him openly.”

Märta Stenevi, the Green Party spokesperson, said, “We are going from a tradition of working for peacekeeping to a situation where we are bowing to an authoritarian regime that has such a long list of human rights violations on its conscience.”

Hungary is likely to seek economic concessions from the upper echelons of the European Union. Hence, Turkey and internal issues in Sweden seem the likely stumbling blocks – especially given recent events.

However, recent political events in Sweden are a setback for the Kurds. Thus the newly elected Prime Minister of Sweden, Ulf Kristersson, is less likely to worry about human rights.

After Kristersson met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey – he said, “My government was elected just a few weeks ago on a mandate to put law and order first… And this includes countering terrorism and terrorist organizations like the PKK in Sweden.”

He continued, “This is why I want to reassure all Turks: Sweden will live up to all the obligations made to Turkey in countering the terrorist threat before becoming a member of NATO and as a future ally.”

However, for Orbán, he seeks to preserve important energy supply routes, consolidate the Visegrad 4, maintain cordial relations with the Russian Federation, support the Hungarian diaspora, and seek favorable economic results from the European Union by supporting Finland and Sweden joining NATO.

1073610435,20221125,"Six and a half years after voting to leave the European Union, three years after the formal departure, two years after signing a post-Brexit trade deal with Brussels and one month after installing its fourth prime minister since the 2016 referendum, Britain is caught in — what else? — another debate over Brexit.

Brexit may be in the history books, but “Bregret,” as the British newspapers have called it, is back in the air.

The cause of the remorse is clear: Britain’s economic crisis, which is the gravest in a generation and worse than those of its European neighbors. Not all — or even most — of the problems are because of Brexit, but Britain’s vexed trade relationship with the rest of Europe indisputably plays a role. That makes it a ripe target for an anxious public casting about for something to blame.

The latest eruption of this never-ending drama began last week with an opinion poll that showed support for Brexit had fallen to its lowest level yet. Only 32 percent of those surveyed in the poll, by the firm YouGov, said that they thought leaving the European Union was a good idea; 56 percent said it was a mistake."
1073614634,20221125,"EU interior ministers address Italy-France migration spat and discuss more coordination in migration management

Every time a group of people seeking refuge in the European Union arrive along the bloc's external borders, debates heat up among EU nations squabbling over how to respond.

The latest of these turned into a political spat between France and Italy, sparked in early November when France allowed 234 rescued asylum seekers onboard the humanitarian ship Ocean Viking to disembark onto its terriroty after Italy refused them safe harbor.

French authorities criticized Italy's hard line on migration and accused Rome of breaching international law that highlights the importance of rescuing distressed people at sea. France also annound that it would no longer take in 3,000 migrants it had promised to accept from Italy.

Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said that while Italy did not intend to create such tensions, the pressure of dealing with migrant arrivals ""shouldn't weigh only on the countries at the external border of Europe.""

Though tensions between France and Italy cooled after the presidents of both nations called for ""full cooperation"" on a number of issues — including supporting each other in addressing migration challenges in the Mediterranean — the row shined a light on the issue of unequal distribution of migrats between EU nations.

EU interior ministers meeting The bloc's interior ministers convened in Brussels on November 25, to discuss such migration challenges across the Union, and in hopes of ensuring that more countries do not get into political disagreements.

""We cannot continue working by addressing one crisis at a time or one ship at a time,"" Vice President of the European Commission Margaritis Schinas told reporters in Brussels. Schinas is coordinating the bloc's Migration and Asylum Pact.

""We need a sustainable European and asylum framework,"" he added.

Roberto Forin, Deputy Director of the Mixed Migration Centre, a migration data and research organization, told DW that arriving at a common solution to address migration and asylum is still a challenge for the EU.

""Major gridlock exists because countries like Italy and Greece — which border the Mediterranean sea — feel the burden of dealing with new migrant arrivals. It [that burden] has fallen on them since the 2015 migration crisis. So the recent approach by Italy towards migrants on the Ocean Viking vessel was sort of a signal to Brussels that Rome wants the EU to ensure countries share the burden of migration distrubution,"" he said.

At their meeting, the bloc's interior ministers addressed the issue and discussed the importance of increasing efforts to implement the solidarity mechanism that a number of EU nations including Italy, agreed to in June. Under this mechanism, asylum seekers can be relocated to another EU country after they have been registered in the country of entry, in order to share the responsibility of migration distribution.

But Forin pointed out that Italy's harsh migration stance is also based on internal politics.

""Every time a change of government takes place in Italy and an anti-immigration political party takes over the government, as is the case now, we see Italy immediately colliding with the rest of Europe on migration,"" he added.

Italy's hardline stance on migration According to a November 2022 report by the UN's refugee agency UNHCR, more than 90,000 people seeking asylum have arrived at Italy's ports this year — a 55% increase compared to last year.

But migrant sea arrivals are a contentious issue for the Italian government, which says ocean migration has made Italy a magnet for migrants seeking to enter Europe illegally.

In her first speech to members of the Italian parliament last month, the country's newly-elected Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who belongs to the country's right-wing Brothers of Italy political party, said she would stop migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean illegally,

Before Meloni's speech, Interior Minister Piantedosi also floated the idea of closing ports to rescue boats that carried migrants to the ports of Italy. While ports have not been closed, the Italian government has called on the EU to develop a code of conduct for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that support asylum seekers and rescue people distressed at sea.

""Preventing rescue boats from docking in Italian ports and pressurising NGOs is nothing new. It was something Italy's 2019 Interior Minister Matteo Salvini did when he closed Italian waters to migrant-rescue ships,"" Forin pointed out.

""Since then, conversations on increased cooperation with non-EU countries like Libya intensified in Italy. The idea was that countries like Libya could also play a role in preventing rescue ships from leaving or transiting through their waters, in turn halting new migrant arrivals,"" he said.

What else is the EU proposing? Improving cooperation with countries in North Africa to prevent departures into the Mediterranean Sea is also a part of the European Commission's latest action planto address migration challenges in the Central Mediterranean.

As a part of the plan, which the Commission released on November 21, the EU aims to spend at least €580 million ($604 million) between 2021 and 2023, to support North African countries in migration management.

Yet, many NGOs slammed the plan.

“This plan is just another reshuffle of old ideas that do not work. It merely distracts from what actually needs to be done — fixing the EU's broken asylum system. It is a waste of time,"" Stephanie Pope, Oxfam's EU migration expert said in an e-mail.

""The EU's response to those fleeing Ukraine shows that where there is political will, there is a way. Instead, the EU continues to throw money at non-EU countries to try to get them to play a role in building fortress Europe. These efforts would be far better spent on investing in proper housing for asylum seekers, creating a functioning asylum system and making migration rules that share the responsibility of welcoming people in Europe,"" she added.

Discussing the feasilbility of the Central Mediterranean Action Plan as a way to prevent more escaltions between countries over migration distribution was an important point of focus when EU interior ministers gathered in Brussels.

But they also discussed how the plan could be used as a model to tackle more migration challenges along the Western Balkans migration route.

""Migration does not necessarily have to be an issue that toxifies politics. We need to bring some normality to the migration debate,"" Schinas told reporters after their meeting, adding that Europe should be a part of the solution, not the problem.

Concrete decisions on dealing with migration issues across the bloc will be finalized at a follow-up meeting on December 8."
