The war on cash has just gone to an entirely new level. When I heard that the European Union was planning to completely ban all cash transactions above 10,000 euros, I had a hard time believing it. There are so many wild rumors flying around on the Internet these days, and so I wasn’t going to write about this unless I could confirm it. Unfortunately, this particular rumor is quite real.

Under the pretext of fighting “money laundering and terrorist financing”, the European Union will be entirely outlawing all cash payments greater than 10,000 euros.

The following comes from the official website of the Council of the European Union…

So this means that in some countries the upper limit could potentially be a lot lower than 10,000 euros.

But instead of framing it as a major move toward a cashless society, the EU is trying to claim that this is all about fighting terrorists.

The following is what Zbyněk Stanjura, the Minister for Finance in the Czech Republic, has said about this upcoming change…

Terrorists and those who finance them are not welcome in Europe. In order to launder dirty money, criminal individuals and organisations had to look for loopholes in our existing rules which are already quite strict. But our intention is to close these loopholes further, and to apply even stricter rules in all EU member states. Large cash payments beyond €10.000 will become impossible. Trying to stay anonymous when buying or selling crypto-assets will become much more difficult. Hiding behind multiple layers of ownership of companies won’t work any more. It will even become difficult to launder dirty money via jewellers or goldsmiths.

Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has been actively considering the possibility of introducing a “digital euro”. The following comes from the official website of the European Central Bank…

As they take cash away from the general population, it turns out that they have already been working on the replacement.

Incredibly, the ECB even has the gall to claim that this new digital currency will be “like cash”…

Yes, you will be able to spend it just like you can spend cash.

But unlike cash, a digital euro will allow authorities to track whatever you buy and sell with it.

By the way, the Federal Reserve is currently working on a digital currency as well.

And this is all happening as the private cryptocurrency industry is imploding all around us.

Many had believed that decentralized cryptocurrencies would be the future of commerce, but global central banks were never going to allow that to happen.

Instead, it appears that they intend to force all of us on to a cashless grid in which everyone uses digital currencies that are issued by them.

Needless to say, a lot of people out there are quite wary of any moves toward a cashless society because they believe that it is part of the “end times” scenario described in the Bible. According to one recent survey, approximately 39 percent of all Americans are convinced that we are living in the “end times” right now…

Other surveys have come up with similar results.

This shouldn’t come as a surprise to any of us, because global events have definitely started to spin out of control in recent years. At this point, even secular websites are publishing articles about the surging popularity of “apocalyptic scenarios”…

Seeing Slate discuss such things made me chuckle.

But this is where we are.

Just about every day, more crazy things take place that have literally never happened before. For example, I came across the following story earlier today…

As time rolls along, things are only going to get even more weird.

If you have been waiting for life to “return to normal”, you can stop right now.

It simply is not going to happen, and I believe that global events will accelerate even more during the early stages of 2023.

It is finally here! Michael’s new book entitled “End Times” is now available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon."
1076249243,20221215,"The EU has promised billions of dollars of investment in Southeast Asia, as leaders looked to bolster ties at a summit in the face of the Ukraine war and challenges from China.

The European Union hosted its first full summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Brussels on Wednesday.

“There might be many, many miles that divide us, but there are much more values that unite us,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathered leaders.

But different opinions about Russia’s war in Ukraine and concerns about tensions with China over a key shipping route for global trade loomed over the meeting.

The EU has been on a diplomatic push to galvanise a global front against Moscow as its invasion has sent economic and political shock waves around the world.

ASEAN’s 10 nations – nine of which were represented, after Myanmar’s military leadership was not invited – have been divided in their response to the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine.

Singapore has gone along with the West on Russia, while Vietnam and Laos, which have close military ties to Moscow, have remained more neutral.

Along with Thailand, they abstained from a United Nations vote in October condemning Russia’s attempted annexation of regions of Ukraine seized since February.

The diverging views led to intense wrangling over a final declaration from the summit as the EU pushed for stronger language to condemn Moscow.

A draught of the final statement said “most members” decried Russia’s war, but conceded there were also “other views and different assessments”.

While Europe pressed for a tougher response to Russia, another global giant figured prominently at the summit.

Chinese claims over the South China Sea have set it against some neighbours and sparked fears in Europe over trade flows through the key global thoroughfare.

But China remains the biggest trade partner for ASEAN and many in the region are wary of distancing themselves from their giant neighbour.

The EU is eager to pitch itself as a reliable partner for southeast Asia’s dynamic economies amid the growing rivalry between Beijing and Washington.

The EU and ASEAN are each other’s third-largest trading partner and Europe sees the region as a key source of raw materials and wants to increase access to its booming markets.

EU nations are pushing to diversify key supply chains away from China as the war in Ukraine has highlighted Europe’s vulnerabilities.

Von der Leyen offered an investment package over the next five years worth 10 billion euros ($10.6bn) under the EU’s Global Gateway strategy designed as a counterweight to China’s largesse.

“There is a battle of offers today in the geopolitical arena, not only a battle of narrative,” said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. “We have to offer more.”

ASEAN and the EU suspended their push for a joint trade deal more than 10 years ago, but the bloc’s top officials said they hoped to relaunch efforts for a broad agreement.

So far, deals with Vietnam and Singapore are in place, and the EU is looking now to make progress with ASEAN’s largest economy Indonesia and to resume talks with Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.

One issue that risked clouding discussions was a new law in Indonesia criminalising sex outside marriage that has sparked fears for foreign visitors to the country.

Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo insisted though that the EU-ASEAN relationship needed to be based more on “equality”.

“There must be no imposition of views,” he said. “There must not be one who dictates over the other and thinks that my standard is better than yours.”__Al Jazeera"

1076251835,20221215,"The only export credit agency in the entire European Union offering insurance for trade with Ukraine is the Polish Export Credit Insurance Corporation (KUKE).As a result of the still ongoing war caused by Russian aggression, trade between Poland and Ukraine has boomed. In particular, it is the steadily increasing exports from Poland to its eastern neighbor in recent months. It increased by almost 70% (year-on-year) in the third quarter, reaching EUR 2.7 billion.On the one hand, the growing sales are helping to fill the growing commodity gaps of the war-ravaged country, and on the other hand they are undoubtedly pleasing Polish companies, especially those that have lost contracts in Russia and Belarus due to those countries' retaliations in response to the economic sanctions imposed on those countries by the West. The fundamental question is - to what extent is trade with Ukrainian partners, primarily due to the ongoing hostilities there, safe. And this is where the KUKE comes to the rescue, as Polish exports to Ukraine are currently protected by the ""Policy without borders"" offered by the Corporation (it is, by the way, a product available for sales to as many as 160 countries, including Ukraine). It protects companies exporting to Ukraine not only against the effects of events typical in trade, such as the insolvency of a counter party, but also against the effects of political events and acts of so-called ""force majeure,"" which can prevent payments from being made. This is a policy for exporters or companies just planning to sell to Ukraine, regardless of their size and industry.""The KUKE is practically the only EU export credit agency open to Ukraine and actively offering insurance,"" said Janusz Wladyczak, president of the Export Credit Insurance Corporation.Polish business is not only interested in continuing to sell goods to Ukraine, but also in rebuilding the country from the devastation caused by the actions of the Russian aggressor. Waldemar Buda, Deputy Minister of Development and Technology, reported that more than 1,400 Polish companies have already signed up for the program on rebuilding Ukraine run by the Polish Investment and Trade Agency (PAIH) on behalf of the ministry he heads. More companies can still apply through a special form available on the PAIH website.As Wladyczak announces, the KUKE is already preparing, through consultations with business, solutions to guarantee insurance for investments related to the reconstruction of a neighbor's economy. These are expected to see the light of day in the first quarter of next year."

1076262453,20221208,"EU member-state governments have flinched at the challenge of enforcing responsible business conduct.

Last week, European Union governments reached a fragile deal on the proposed directive on corporate sustainability. The initial aim of this measure was ambitious—to prevent abuse and provide a remedy to victims for harms such as forced labour or oil spills.

The Council of the EU did close some of the gaps in the European Commission’s proposal. But it signed off on a draft law whose loopholes will allow many powerful companies to evade responsibility for clearcut wrongdoing and undermine the potential to enforce responsible business conduct.

After much hard negotiation about how far obligations should reach into the value chains of companies, the vague concept of a ‘chain of activities’ emerged. This does not extend to the full spectrum of downstream activities: there will be waivers for companies that sell such products and services as pesticides, other chemicals, security equipment and surveillance technologies. Nor will businesses have to worry at all about how their products or services are used—that includes the finance sector.

Companies will thus still be able to sell dangerous digital tools, such as Pegasus, to repressive governments, without carrying out human-rights due diligence—they will not be held accountable for the harm to journalists or activists caused by their spyware. Firms could continue to supply to business partners which were implicated in international crimes or work with distributors violating workers’ rights.

European ministers last week also excluded some fundamental human-rights protections from the proposed law, including children’s rights and rights related to the elimination of discrimination against women. This ignores international standards—while overlooking national due-diligence laws in France, Germany and the Netherlands—and would allow appalling human-rights abuses to be swept under the rug.

Not only is it essential that the directive cover all human rights. The definition of what constitutes an ‘adverse human rights impact’ should not come with conditions that exponentially increase legal uncertainty for affected communities, courts and companies alike.

For example, as the text stands, damage caused by companies alongside state authorities could continue with impunity. Such abuse is rampant in countries with authoritarian regimes, high corruption and/or armed conflict, where corporations should instead be hypervigilant. Companies enabling and profiting from violations of international humanitarian law, such as Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, must be held accountable.

The environmental science meanwhile remains unchanged: we need to do everything in our power to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and avoid dangerous ecological tipping points. Yet just weeks after talking a big game at COP27, the member-state representatives failed to align environmental requirements with international standards, such as the Paris Agreement, and did not include climate due diligence in the envisaged rules.

Instead, they weakened the already meagre provisions on the environment. If this were to be sustained, companies would not be accountable to courts even if they destroyed entire ecosystems—think of the decades of oil discharges in the Niger delta by a subsidiary of Shell.

This would be a huge step backwards from existing jurisprudence. In last year’s landmark case against Shell, Dutch judges spelt out that companies have an individual responsibility to combat climate change, because of its severe impacts on human rights.

Climate change is not only already bringing famine and rising sea levels. Following the severe flooding in Pakistan, a million people are projected to lose their jobs in the garment sector alone. These job losses will exacerbate appalling conditions for those still in work.

Governments need to get serious about setting a minimum level of acceptable business conduct if we are to have any chance of withstanding the havoc of the climate, nature, energy and health crises. Today’s transition costs are miniscule compared with those of doing nothing.

Countries such as Germany tried to exempt companies from legal liability under the directive if they joined industry initiatives or relied on third-party audits. Leaving aside the well-documented ineffectiveness of social auditors and certifiers in identifying impacts and preventing harm, this would have shifted attention away from what is needed to address the root causes of corporate abuse. The suggestion was rightly rejected but it set negotiators on the path of curtailing liability.

The current proposal, on the other hand, does nothing to pull down the legal barriers faced by claimants in taking cases against companies, such as high costs, short time limits and limited access to evidence. This makes it more difficult for workers and communities in situations of vulnerability to have their day in court for forced labour or unsafe working conditions. For some governments, business interests come first, protecting people and the planet a distant second.

In speech after speech last week, European ministers said they wanted companies to have a level playing-field, so they could rely on common rules. Yet even within that corporate perspective they opted to entrench a ‘race to the bottom’ by leaving inclusion of finance at the discretion of each member state. Financiers, who should be obliged to channel capital towards more sustainable activities, will be able to continue bankrolling fossil fuels, deforestation and human-rights violations without scrutiny.

Only a few financial institutions and services would be required to carry out human-rights and environmental due-diligence checks over the chains of their clients. This near-exclusion was the result of an intense push by a handful of member states, led by France. France presents itself as a champion of due diligence—it was the first country to adopt a national law in 2017—but it is sabotaging it in Brussels, linked to its ambition to make Paris Europe’s top financial hub in a post-‘Brexit’ world.

If the proposal—supported by Spain, Italy and Slovakia—succeeds in the trilogue negotiations next year, including the European Parliament, many financial companies would face an odd reality: they would need to do due diligence when buying paper for their copy machines, but not when financing a company responsible for a deadly dam collapse such as that in Brumadinho.

Lowest-common-denominator politics prevailed in Brussels last week, leaving everyone in the council chamber, as the Czech presidency put it, ‘equally unhappy’. But it would be workers, consumers and communities who would get the short end of the stick.

Governments that understand that the economy of the 21st century can’t be built on exploitation and destruction will need to push harder to protect human rights, the environment and the climate. The European Parliament will also need to raise the bar."

1076273652,20221215,"The European Union has returned to the ritual of sanctioning Iran to leverage its foreign and security policies. The highlight of the EU Foreign Affairs Council ministerial meeting in Brussels on Monday was the imposition of sanctions against Iran over a range of issues.

The issues were “the unacceptable repression of the ongoing protests and the worsening human rights situation” in Iran, Iran’s military cooperation with Russia, including delivery of drones deployed against Ukraine, the prospects of renewal of the JCPOA as well as regional security.

The Council added 20 individuals and one entity to the EU’s existing Iran human rights sanctions regime plus four individuals and four entities for the development and delivery of drones used by Russia in Ukraine.

While imposing these sanctions, EU demands that those responsible for the killing of Mahsa Amini must be held accountable; Iranian authorities should ensure “transparent and credible investigations to clarify the number of deaths and arrests”, and release all non-violent protesters and provide due process to all detainees and lift restrictions on internet access and unblock instant messaging platforms.

The EU Council threatened that it “will consider all the options at its disposal” to address the situation arising out of the death of Mahsa Amini and the way Iranian security forces handled the demonstrations.

Those sanctioned include top executives of Iran Broadcasting, “which is notorious for being a regime mouthpiece,” Iran’s Deputy Minister of Interior and some IRGC commanders. Equally, Gen. Hamid Vahedi, Iran’s chief of air force, has been put on sanctions list for Iran’s “military support” for Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Ironically, while the EU Council meeting charged ahead on Iran sanctions, it failed to reach consensus on the expected 9th sanctions package on Russia, “against the Kremlin, for escalating its aggression against Ukraine.” Borrell said the Council of Ministers could not agree “to react to the latest escalation,” but he expected an approval of the new tough package during this week.

On the whole, Borrell was in a mellowed mood, though, claiming that the EU is making a careful distinction between punishing Iran on its human rights record and military support to Russia and the Iranian nuclear programme.

As he put it, “You will understand that, in this situation the JCPOA is in a very difficult situation. But I think that we do not have a better option than the JCPOA to ensure that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. This remains in our own interest.”

Borrell disclosed that he talks “quite often” with Iran’s foreign minister and “We share, we disagree, but, at least, we talk to each other. I think that diplomacy is here to keep the channels of communication open in any circumstances. I think that it was good that, before the Council took this [sanctions] decision today, I could inform the Minister and he could explain [to] me what is happening and I explain [to] him my concerns. And these concerns brought to these decisions.”

Borrell said: “I want to make a clear difference between the nuclear deal… and the decision taken by the Foreign Affairs Council on the issue of human rights and supply of arms to Russia. They are two different things.

Unsurprisingly, Tehran has hit back by announcing its own sanctions on several EU and British officials and entities “over their deliberate support of terrorism and terrorist groups, and their incitement to terrorism, violence and hatred, which have caused unrest, violence, terrorist acts and violation of human rights against the Iranian nation.”

Looking ahead, the big question is whether Tehran accepts the “Borrell way” of selective engagement—even if he took his Iranian counterpart into confidence. The EU will selectively engage with Tehran on the JCPOA because it is in the interests of the collective West, especially the Biden Administration, which would like the door to be kept open to resume the negotiations with Iran in Vienna that were suspended in August.

The energy crisis in Europe is a compelling factor here. Nonetheless, the EU probably also shares the Biden Administration’s estimation that the current disturbances in Iran cannot be easily suppressed. On the other hand, Tehran cannot be expected to compromise on any perceived challenge to the regime.

Also, the EU may have acted excessively by sanctioning Imam Sayyid Ahmad Khatami, a senior cleric and influential conservative and principalist politician who also happens to be a member of the powerful Guardian Council as well as the Assembly of Experts, who was appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as Tehran’s “substitute” Friday prayer leader in 2005, a position he holds ever since.

In the final analysis, the trail of linkages outlined by Borrell ultimately leads to Moscow. Basically, the EU is messaging that JCPOA (lifting of western sanctions) will be conditional on Iran’s willingness to roll back its deepening ties with Russia.

The drone part is only the tip of the iceberg; what really causes uneasiness in Washington and Brussels is that Russia may borrow from Iran’s toolbox to undercut western sanctions. Iran’s geography as well as its geopolitics makes it a unique partner for Russia today. (See my article U.S. internationalizes Iran’s unrest, Asia Times)

Tehran is unlikely to budge on its firm handling of the unrest in the country. Indeed, there is remarkable consistency in Iran’s political history through the past 4 decades that there can be no compromises on the challenges to the fundamentals of the Islamic regime that came into existence through the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Clearly, the western powers are barking up the wrong tree—knowingly or unknowingly.

The defiant remarks of the Commander-in-Chief of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Major General Hossein Salami recently—the stark warning by the general that Iran today has “achieved all the military technologies in the world”—should leave the Biden Administration in no doubt.

That said, on the resumption of the JCPOA talks with the United States, Tehran remains interested.

1076281429,20221215,"(Budapest) – The Polish government’s ongoing attacks on the rule of law are harming the rights of women and LGBT people and require stronger action from the European Union, Human Rights Watch said today.

Since the Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power in Poland in 2015, the government has persistently attacked the rights of women and LGBT people in the context of its broader attacks on the rule of law. The government has deliberately undermined the independence of the judiciary and media freedom and sought to silence independent civil society groups, activists, and those who protest against its policies, including through the courts.

“The rule of law crisis in Poland undermines democratic institutions, seriously damaging protections for people’s rights, including women and LGBT people,” said Lydia Gall, senior Europe and Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The European Union needs to get serious about its responsibility to the people of Poland and step up its efforts to arrest the Polish government’s devastating rule of law crackdown.”

Since 2020, ongoing Human Rights Watch research shows the harmful consequences of the government’s undermining of the rule of law in Poland, and how the political hijacking of courts and use of the justice system to impede civil society have undermined the rights of women, girls, and LGBT people. Human Rights Watch had not received any response to its letters to the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior in November 2022 setting out our concerns and seeking comment.

Human Rights Watch interviewed four LGBT activists and organizations, and eleven representatives of women’s rights organizations in Poland as well as six LGBT people who have personally experienced the harmful effects of the government-led anti-LGBT campaign.

Hostile attitudes toward LGBT people found full expression in 2019 when regions and municipalities began to declare themselves “LGBT Ideology Free” or joined a government-supported Family Charter, calling for the exclusion of LGBT people from Polish society. More than 90 regional and municipal authorities have now declared themselves “LGBT ideology free” or signed the charter.

Even though Poland’s law on abortion was already among the most restrictive in Europe, the government used a politically compromised court in October 2020 to effectively ban access to legal abortions, forcing many women and girls to go abroad to terminate pregnancies.

In October, the group Abortion Without Borders reported that between October 2021 and October 2022, requests for help from women and girls in Poland accessing abortion skyrocketed. Activists described the initial devastation and desperation of women and girls who said they might now be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. Activists in many cases managed to assist women terminating their pregnancies, often under difficult circumstances, including to travel abroad.

At least five women are known to have died after doctors did not terminate their pregnancies despite complications that put their health and lives at risk.

In the first known prosecution in Europe of an abortion activist for providing pills for medication abortion, prosecutors have charged Justyna Wydrzyńska of the Abortion Dream Team with assisting someone to have an abortion and illegally “marketing” medication without authorization. Hearings in her case have been postponed to January 2023.

Since Law and Justice came into power in Poland, LGBT activists have faced pressure and interference from the authorities over their peaceful activism, including arrests and criminal prosecutions, some under blasphemy laws. LGBT activists also reported the use by local authorities of what is known as Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (“SLAPP”) lawsuits to interfere with, and silence their work.

In addition to undermining the independent functioning of civil society, a clear rule of law violation, these measures have helped contribute to a hostile climate for LGBT people and activism in Poland.

Bart Staszewski, a leading Polish LGBT activist, told Human Rights Watch in June 2021 that he repeatedly reported threats against him, including death threats, to the police but that no serious steps had been taken to investigate. The threats followed the “Atlas of Hate” campaign, founded by other activists, that included an interactive map delineating the LGBT Ideology Free zones in Poland, and a related photo project called “Zones” that Staszewski undertook.

The misuse of Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal to further the government’s political agenda at the expense of rights has not stopped with the abortion ban, Human Rights Watch said. The government asked the tribunal in 2020 and 2021 to rule on whether the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (the Istanbul Convention) and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects rights in Council of Europe member states, are compatible with the Polish constitution, in an effort to justify withdrawing from the former and ignoring binding rulings from the latter. The tribunal in March ruled the ECHR partially incompatible with the Polish constitution.

EU institutions have a duty to hold Poland to account for its dismal rule of law record that has harmed the lives of women, girls, and LGBT people, Human Rights Watch said. Poland should ensure access to safe and legal abortion, and cease attacks on and prosecutions of LGBT and women’s rights activists.

The European Parliament has spoken out against Poland’s decision to ban abortion and its announcement to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention. The Commission put funds on hold in September 2021 to five regions unless they abandoned anti-LGBT declarations, which resulted in four regions abandoning the declarations. In July 2021, the Commission took the first step of a legal infringement procedure against Poland because of the impact of the so-called ‘LGBT-ideology free zones’ resolutions. However, the EU Commission and EU member states have failed to address the implications of rule of law backsliding on women’s rights. European Commissioner for Equality criticised the Constitutional Tribunal ruling on abortion in November 2021 but said the EU had no authority to act on reproductive rights.

The EU Commission should trigger infringement proceedings or expand existing infringements to address the erosion of the rule of law that put women’s rights and the rights of LGBT people at risk. It should also issue an update to the December 2017 Reasoned Proposal, which initiated scrutiny under the Article 7 procedure, the EU-treaty-based mechanism dealing with EU states that put democratic ideals at risk, to extend EU scrutiny to developments since December 2017, including the use of a compromised Constitutional Tribunal to undermine women’s rights and laws and policies that undermine EU values such as nondiscrimination and tolerance.

European Commissioners should publicly condemn attacks on and judicial harassment against women’s rights and LGBT rights activists and organizations in Poland and the government’s support for or failure to denounce such attacks as violations of the EU values linked to undermining the rule of law.

The EU Council should move its scrutiny forward under Article 7 over the risk the Polish government’s actions pose to EU values, by adopting specific rule-of-law recommendations and holding a vote to determine there is a clear risk of a serious breach of EU values in Poland. Sweden, which will hold the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU starting in January 2023 for six months, should lead those efforts.

“EU institutions should move the Article 7 process forward and use its legal enforcement powers to protect the rights of the people affected by Poland’s attack on the rule of law,” Gall said. “In an EU member state in 2022, women shouldn’t have to face being denied abortion, LGBT people shouldn’t face hostility for who they are, and neither should risk punishment when they stand up for their rights.”

The Impact of Poland’s Rule of Law Erosion on LGBT People and Activists

The rights of LGBT people in Poland have come under increasing pressure since the Law and Justice party came into power. The authorities in more than 90 traditionally conservative regions and municipalities have declared themselves “LGBT Ideology Free” areas or signed the Family Charter since 2019.

The charter’s self-proclaimed purpose is to promote traditional family values and protect children against immorality. The charter indirectly denies the rights of same-sex couples by explicit references to marriage being a union between a man and woman, as well as parenthood being a shared responsibility between a man and woman.

Activists and LGBT people told Human Rights Watch that the creation of the LGBT-ideology free zones has had a chilling effect on LGBT people living in them. A December 2021 Council of Europe Parliament Assembly report on combating rising hate against LGBTI people in Europe concluded that the zones “deny LGBTI people’s right to exist and deprive them of a safe space.”

These declarations have drawn criticism from the European Commission. However, high-ranking public officials in Poland, including the PiS ruling party leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, have endorsed and promoted the declarations and their exclusionary and discriminatory language towards LGBT people. Activists said that the Education and Science Ministry has sent letters of support to regions or cities adopting resolutions against “LGBT ideology.”

Under the resolutions and charter, regional and local governments should refrain from encouraging tolerance toward LGBT people and cut funds to organizations promoting nondiscrimination and gender equality.

While they are legally unenforceable, LGBT activists told Human Rights Watch that the “LGBT Ideology Free” zones are attempts to stigmatize, exclude, and indirectly discriminate against members of the LGBT community, sending the message that LGBT people are not welcome in these areas.

Civil society plays a vital role in a democratic society in holding the authorities to account. Yet in Poland, LGBT activists have been arrested and prosecuted in an effort to silence them and their activism. In August 2020, an LGBT activist, Malgorzata Szutowicz, known as “Margot,” was arrested and charged for damaging a truck spewing false anti-LGBT propaganda. The same month, activists were arrested followed a campaign of placing rainbow flags on prominent public monuments.

A blasphemy law has been used under the current government to arrest and prosecute LGBT activists. On Twitter on August 5, 2020, the Warsaw police confirmed they had arrested three people for “insulting religious feelings and insulting Warsaw monuments” under the blasphemy law. While the three LGBT activists arrested in August 2020 were acquitted by a court in March 2021, another activist was in February 2021 under the blasphemy law for posting an image of a foot stamping on the Virgin Mary. An October 2022 bill, supported by Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, proposes sentences of up to two years in prison for anyone who “publicly insults or ridicules the church.” LGBT activists also complain of increasing use of “SLAPP” civil lawsuits by local authorities, to deter activists from speaking out about the government’s and authorities’ anti-LGBT policies.

By publicly supporting anti-LGBT measures adopted by regional and local authorities and at the same time clamping down on LGBT activists speaking out about the hostile climate the measures are helping to foster, the government is failing in its responsibility to protect LGBT people in Poland from discrimination, Human Rights Watch said.

The EU Commission responded to the anti-LGBT developments in Poland in June 2020 by threatening to withhold funds to five regions in Poland unless they abandoned their anti-LGBT declarations. In March 2021, the European Parliament declared the EU an LGBTQI Freedom zone. In July 2021, the European Commission decided to initiate the first stage of a legal infringement procedure against Poland over the failure by Polish authorities to respond to the Commission’s concerns about the zones. As a result of EU action, four regions have revoked anti-LGBT declarations for fear of losing EU funds. The infringement procedure is pending, and the European Commission has not yet brought it to the European Court of Justice.

The EU Commission should also press Poland’s government to end arrests and prosecutions of LGBT activists exercising their freedom of expression, as guaranteed both under Polish and EU law.

The Impact of Poland’s Rule of Law Erosion on Reproductive Rights

Since 2015, the Polish government has made aggressive efforts to further restrict women’s reproductive rights and the work of women’s rights organizations, at times misusing and undermining democratic institutions to do so.

The cornerstone of the government’s assault on women’s reproductive rights has been its effort to ban legal abortion. An October 2020 ruling by the politically compromised Constitutional Tribunal invalidated the constitutionality of access to abortion on grounds of “severe and irreversible fetal defect or incurable illness that threatens the fetus’ life,” one of only three circumstances in which abortion was legal under Poland’s highly restrictive Family Planning Act of 1993. The ruling entered into force on January 27, 2021, resulting in a near-total ban on legal abortion in Poland.

The only two remaining legal exceptions are in cases of pregnancy resulting from a criminal act, such as rape or incest, or where it poses a threat to a pregnant person’s life or health. In practice, though, multiple barriers prevent even those eligible for a legal abortion from obtaining one, including conscientious objection by medical professionals, lack of information, and the need for prosecutors to “confirm” a rape or other criminal act resulting in pregnancy.

The Constitutional Tribunal ruling is a retrogressive measure that rolls back the right to abortion and violates the rights to life, health, bodily autonomy, nondiscrimination, and freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, among others. Expert bodies including the United Nations experts on discrimination against women and on the right to health and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics have stated that abortion is essential health care.

In addition, the ruling’s legitimacy is problematic for two reasons. First, the court itself is compromised as a result of political interference in judicial appointments to the court, with several of its judges loyal to the ruling party appointed through flawed procedures. In the abortion ruling, rather than operating independently, the tribunal was acting at the behest of the government to deliver a legal outcome the democratically elected parliament had declined to approve.

Second, rather than observing typical parliamentary procedure, the government turned to the court to introduce a near-total ban only after it had tried and failed in 2016 and 2019 to pass similar legislation triggered by citizen initiatives led by a government-allied faith group, and in the face of mass public protests against the law.

The Constitutional Tribunal ruling has had devastating effects on women and girls in Poland, including at least five women who are known to have died after doctors did not terminate pregnancies despite complications that potentially posed risks to the woman’s lives or health. It may also result in women and girls being forced to carry pregnancies to term, even in cases in which the pregnancy was not viable. Some women have said the ruling is affecting their or their daughters’ reproductive lives and choices, noting that they no longer want to become pregnant in Poland out of fear that they will not be able to get the necessary health care, particularly if they need an abortion.

According to data by Abortion Without Borders, from October 2021 to October 2022, the network had helped 44,000 women accessing abortion, which is 10,000 more than the previous year. Prior to the 2020 ruling, the figure was 6,000.

Prior to the October 2020 ruling, Poland already had one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the European Union. Official statistics show that about 1,000 legal abortions were performed in Poland each year before the October 2020 ruling, over 90 percent of them on grounds of “severe or irreversible fetal defects or incurable illnesses that threaten the fetus’ life.”

However, women’s rights groups estimate that between 80,000 to 120,000 abortions actually took place each year, in some cases with the aid of medications that women acquire from abroad through women’s rights groups and networks. Having to travel or acquire medication from abroad to terminate pregnancies is not a substitute for effective access to reproductive and sexual health care and may increase women’s pain and suffering, Human Rights Watch said.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in 2007, 2011, and 2012 ruled against Poland and its restrictive laws and policies around abortion and reproductive rights in, R.R. v. Poland, P. and S. v. Poland, and Tysiaç v. Poland. Poland has failed to effectively carry out these decisions, all of which found Poland in violation of the European convention with respect to women’s reproductive rights. Since the Constitutional tribunal ruling came into force in January 2021, over 1,000 women have turned to the European Court in an effort to vindicate their rights, challenging Poland’s highly restrictive abortion law and seeking justice supported by civil society groups including Human Rights Watch.

As with LGBT activism, the response of the government has been to seek to silence civil society groups and individuals that speak out on these issues.

Women’s rights activists face prosecution for speaking out against the tribunal decision and its impact on women’s and girl’s reproductive rights. Marta Lempart, a co-founder of All-Poland Women’s Strike (Ogólnopolski Strajk Kobiet, OSK), told Human Rights Watch in November 2022 that in February 2021, she was criminally charged for insulting a police officer, posing an “epidemiological threat” by breaching Covid restrictions, and praising vandalism of churches due to favorable comments she made in a radio interview regarding protesters who had spray painted church facades and disrupted masses.

Lempart also said that she has more than 90 lawsuits pending against her for her activism. She described them as “politically motivated.” Women’s rights activists have also faced SLAPP lawsuits brought by officials aimed at silencing their work.

While people who get an abortion cannot be criminally prosecuted under the law, a person who assists someone to get an abortion can. Justyna Wydrzynska, an abortion rights activist and co-founder of Abortion Dream Team , faces up to three years in prison on charges of assisting someone to have an abortion and illegally “marketing” medication without authorization, for assisting a woman in obtaining medical abortion pills to terminate a pregnancy. This is the first known case of its kind in the EU. Her case is pending.

In November, Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, a member of the Polish parliament, was charged with “offending religious feelings and “malicious interference with worship,” each offense carrying a penalty of up to two years in prison. Scheuring-Wielgus had participated in a peaceful protest in October by carrying a banner in Torun church reading “Woman, you can decide for yourself.”

The response of key EU institutions to the impacts of Poland’s undermining the rule of law on women’s and girls’ reproductive rights has been muted, as the Commission has been reluctant to view such rights violations are part of the broader breakdown of rule of law in Poland. The Commission should trigger new or expand existing infringement proceedings when such rule of law breaches lead to violations of women’s reproductive rights and to arrests and prosecutions of women’s and abortion rights activists. The Commission should also press Warsaw to implement all outstanding European Court of Human Rights rulings that relate to rule of law or reproductive rights.

Member states within the EU Council and other EU institutions should consider the impact of the rule of law on reproductive rights when they assess Poland’s compliance with the rule of law including in the context of the Article 7 procedure.

The Polish government’s misuse of the politically compromised Constitutional Tribunal to undermine the rule of law and human rights protections has not been confined to reproductive rights.

In July 2020, Justice Minister Ziobro announced that he would move forward with Poland’s withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention. The move sent a clear message about its disregard for women victims of violence. Poland had signed the Convention in 2012 and ratified it in 2015.

The government justified its intention to withdraw from the Convention because it claims the treaty promotes a “leftist political agenda and its definition of gender as socially constructed roles is a problem.” The same month, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced that he had “decided to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to examine whether the Istanbul Convention is in line with the Polish constitution.” The case is pending.

The government asked the Constitutional Tribunal in November 2021 to assess whether the European Convention on Human Rights is compatible with the Polish constitution, a move that appears linked to adverse rulings against Poland by the European Court of Human Rights, which enforces the Convention. In March, the tribunal ruled the ECHR partially incompatible with the Polish constitution.

The European Commission has triggered an infringement proceeding following the Constitutional Tribunal rulings which found the provisions of the EU Treaties incompatible with the Polish Constitution, considering that “the Constitutional Tribunal no longer meets the requirement of an independent and impartial tribunal.”"
1076279466,20221215,"BRUSSELS, Belgium: President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr., acting as lead coordinator for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), secured the commitment of cooperation from no less than European Council President Charles Michel in various areas which include trade and climate mitigation.

The two leaders met Wednesday (Manila time) at the Europa Building, the seat of the European Council and the Council of the European Union (EU), ahead of the formal opening of the Asean-EU Commemorative Summit here.

During their face-to-face, Marcos pointed out how the Asean increased its presence in the global stage through regional economic integration and supply chain resilience therefore giving it a vital role in the world economy, ""as shown clearly by their growth with systems already in place.""

The President then emphasized that with economic progress, there must also be a corresponding responsibility to ensure environmental sustainability thus the need for the Asean and EU to band together tooperationalize the green fund on climate change and the damage and loss policy.

One particular step was the establishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) that will act as the financial mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The GCF aims to encourage the paradigm shift towards low-emission and climate-resilient development by providing support to developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) while at the same time adapting to the effects of climate change.

The Chief Executive echoed what he said during the Asean-EU Association of Southeast Asian Nations-European Union (Asean-EU) working luncheon with EU leaders and businessmen in Brussels, where he urged them to step up aid to vulnerable countries like the Philippines.

Climate action is particularly important to the Philippines, said the President, especially since the country is ""regarded as probably one of the most, if not the most, vulnerable countries in the world to the effects of climate change.""

""Since that seems to be the case and that is what we are facing in the Philippines, we are very much in need of the assistance of Europe, of all the first world countries and to be able to adjust our economy, our communities to the onset of the effects of climate change,"" the President said.

According to the President, he has observed ""all the progress"" in the Conference of Parties (COP) and views with ""some optimism"" that ""the concept of damage and loss has now been accepted by all parties involved.""

""We couldn't agree with you more,"" Michel said in response, and added that both regional blocs must immediately craft more concrete funding guidelines on mitigating climate change damage and loss.

Michel likewise expressed the EU's eagerness to work with the Philippines and the Asean to mitigate effects of climate change, particularly on the transfer of green technology, which involves improving resilience to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

To recall, Marcos noted during his participation at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in Bangkok, Thailand, last month that the Philippines had started prioritizing tapping renewable energy options such as hydropower, geothermal power, solar, and other low-emission energy sources in efforts to lessen the country's carbon footprint."
1076286604,20221215,"With Xi Jinping’s mid-December visit to Saudi Arabia, most of the analysis has focused on the Chinese side, especially on Beijing’s campaign to strengthen its foothold in the Middle East. However, little attention has been paid to how the recent visit also exemplifies the Middle East’s growing interest in Asia.

China is obviously the focus of this newfound interest, with Chinese technology flourishing across the Gulf region in the form of the Digital Silk Road exemplified by Huawei 5G communications – which the US has tried vainly to block – and BeiDou satellite navigation technology. The Gulf countries are “natural cooperative partners in China’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative,” according to the China Institute of International Studies. China, with no natural fossil fuel domestic production, is an eager suitor.

Beyond that, the diversification of Middle Eastern foreign policy, which has for decades focused primarily on the US as its guarantor, into the East and Southeast Asian region is a manifestation of attention which is starting to be paid, particularly as trade matures between the regions. According to the independent think tank Asia House, trade is set to reach approximately US$578 billion by 2030, surpassing that with advanced economies by 2028, if current growth rates are maintained. China’s trade with Saudi Arabia alone stood at US$81.7 billion in 2021, exceeding Riyadh’s trade with the US, the UK, and the Euro Area combined (US$81.4 billion).

This “Pivot to Asia” policy, as it has come to be known, has raised concerns for the West. As a traditional partner, especially in political and security cooperation, the West is increasingly wary of its restive client states who are starting to look at strategic opportunities outside of their allies. For the Middle Eastern leaders themselves, organizations like Asean are a springboard to strengthen political, economic, and security relations. The region, with its sizeable Muslim population and its growing economic potential, is a natural magnet. Thus, a steady parade of officials to Asia from Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia has exemplified new Middle Eastern footholds, which previously had been neglected.

The deeper the engagement, the more estranged the Middle East is expected to become from potential political and economic partners in the West as the regional countries seek new trade and diplomatic arrangements. The Xi visit to Riyadh is only the most visible example. The Arab leadership is increasingly active in strengthening diplomatic representation in Asia and its member countries to enhance their position in international affairs and increase options for developing strategic partnerships.

The Middle East countries, shored up by fossil fuel revenues, have been undergoing massive economic growth. Large international business and finance centers have emerged as well as the region’s capacity for investment grows. They continue to push for ambitious development. Based on their economic visions, the Arab countries expect foreign investment to keep their projects going in the long term and sustainably, and investors from the Asian economies are also expected to be willing participants.

""Pivot to Asia,"" a catchy slogan purloined – maybe ironically – from former US President Barack Obama’s vain attempt to reorient the US’s foreign policy, is also one of the motivations for the Arab countries because of the continuing reduction in US military power.

“Proponents of a major reduction of forces (in the Middle East) argue that it is necessary because of growing competition with China in the Indo-Pacific and Russia in Europe, a declining U.S. reliance on Gulf oil and gas, a reduced threat from terrorist groups, and a need to focus on diplomacy rather than military force,” according to Seth G. Jones and Seamus P. Daniels, in an analysis for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

There is thus an assumption that the US is beginning to let go of the region in which it is the main security partner. Its Middle East partners see that US military power is currently more focused on Asia to deal with China's growing power. Therefore, due to the uncertainty of US commitments, Arab leaders are taking the initiative to seek alternative partners, especially given that the US and its allies are no longer the only ones dominating the global order after growing China's presence.

China also cares little about the messy human rights concerns that Western powers seek to impose on Middle Eastern satrapies. Beijing cares little that there is convincing evidence that Saudi leader Mohamad Bin Salman was involved in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. US President Joe Biden has gone so far as to call the Saudi prince a “pariah.” This has seriously affected the closeness of the relationship between the two and may well have spurred the invitation to Xi to visit Riyadh.

The West, however, is not unaware of the shifting global situation and involvement in multilateral cooperation in Asian regional organizations such as ASEAN and indeed some of the Middle Eastern states continue to see it in their interest to maintain productive ties, particularly as the US, in particular, remains a guarantor of stability, with volatile political situations countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen and with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State continuing to exploit sectarian and ethnic tensions to gain support.

Although the influence of the West continues to wane as the Middle East states cultivate other ethnic, diplomatic, political, and economic interests, close relationships nonetheless continue to remain with, for example, the European Union, which recently launched a Joint Communication on “Strategic Partnership with the Gulf states” which aims to deepen and broaden cooperation.

In this partnership, the European Union is also committed to increasing its political and economic presence in the GCC and the wider MENA region. The European Union's commitment to the Middle East was announced in line with increasing Western concerns of the two as cooperation in the Middle East shifts to Asia, especially China. Whereas previously Europe was the largest trading partner of the Gulf, in 2020 total Gulf-China bilateral trade cooperation unseated it by US$161.4 billion.

The Middle East states’ interest in maintaining relations with Western treaty organizations such as NATO is based on mutual foreign policy benefit. However, cooperation with Asia is an attempt to equalize the perceived deficit of interest from Europe and the United States, especially in conditions of global crisis. Middle Eastern countries are likely to continue to forge relationships with Western and Asian nations to achieve the best outcome for their long-term security and economic interests. Nonetheless, the world’s long-term arrangements are beginning to shift."

He also presented the Golden Plate Award to President Macky Sall of Senegal and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization. He received the same award back in 2017.

Rwanda announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in March 2020.

In September 2021, The World Health Organisation, commended Rwanda's vaccination drive, after the country reached the September global target which was to fully vaccinate 10 percent of its population against Covid-19.

By this time, only 14 African countries had achieved the first target and only three countries had achieved the 40 per cent target.

In December 2021, Rwanda announced that it had achieved its target of administering two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine to 30 percent of the population before the end of 2021.

A total of 3,880,262 people had been double-jabbed, while 6,388,237 had received one dose by December 7, 2021.

According to recent data, by September 2022, over 81 percent of the population were fully vaccinated.

The country is also administering the second booster dose to high-risk people including those aged 65 and above.

In June 2021, Rwanda signed a Rwf3.6 billion agreement with the European Union (EU) to enhance the attractiveness of Rwanda for investments in vaccine manufacturing.

In June 2022, President Paul Kagame led the ceremony to break ground for the construction of the BioNTech vaccine manufacturing plant in Rwanda that will promote scalable mRNA vaccine production in Africa.

The manufacturing plant for mRNA-based vaccines is being built in the Kigali Special Economic Zone located in Masoro-Munini, Gasabo District, in a section earmarked for biopharma manufacturing.

WHO Director-General Tedros said the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the need for significantly greater local production of vaccines and other essential products in all regions of the world, especially in Africa which relies heavily on imported products and was left behind in the global rush for Covid-19 vaccines."

BRUSSELS—The EU vowed billions of dollars of investment in Southeast Asia Wednesday, as leaders looked to bolster ties at a summit in the face of the Ukraine war and challenges from China.

The European Union billed its first full summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Brussels as a chance to push trade relations with the region’s fast-growing economies.

“There might be many, many miles that divide us, but there are much more values that unite us,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathered leaders.

But different opinions over Russia’s war in Ukraine and concerns about tensions with China over a key shipping route for global trade loomed over the meeting.

The EU has been on a diplomatic push to galvanize a global front against Moscow as its invasion has sent economic and political shock waves around the world.

ASEAN’s 10 nations—nine of which were represented, after Myanmar’s junta was not invited—have been divided in their response to the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.

Singapore has gone along with Western sanctions on Russia, while Vietnam and Laos, which have close military ties to Moscow, have remained more neutral.

Along with Thailand, they abstained from a United Nations vote in October condemning Russia’s attempted annexation of regions of Ukraine seized since February.

The diverging views led to intense wrangling over a declaration from the summit as the EU pushed for stronger language to condemn Moscow.

The final statement said “most members” decried Russia’s war, but conceded there were also “other views and different assessments”.

While Europe pressed for a tougher response to Russia, another global giant figured prominently at the summit.

Chinese claims over the South China Sea have set it against some neighbors and sparked fears in Europe over trade flows through the key global thoroughfare.

But China remains the biggest trade partner for ASEAN and many in the region are wary of distancing themselves from their giant neighbor.

The EU is keen to pitch itself as a reliable partner for Southeast Asia’s dynamic economies amid the growing rivalry between Beijing and Washington.

The EU and ASEAN are each other’s third-largest trading partner and Europe sees the region as a key source for raw materials and wants to increase access to its booming markets.

EU nations are pushing to diversify key supply chains away from China as the war in Ukraine has highlighted Europe’s vulnerabilities.

Von der Leyen offered an investment package over the next five years worth 10 billion euros (US$10.6 billion) under the EU’s Global Gateway strategy designed as a counterweight to China’s largesse.

But ASEAN leaders insisted they would not be forced to make a choice between the global players competing for influence.

“We absolutely refuse to go back to the situation of the Cold War where we have to pick sides in terms of who the superpower is that we are aligned with,” said Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

ASEAN and the EU suspended their push for a joint trade deal over a decade ago, but the bloc’s top officials said they hoped to relaunch efforts for a broad agreement.

So far deals with Vietnam and Singapore are in place, and the EU is looking now to make progress with ASEAN’s largest economy Indonesia and to resume talks with Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.

One issue that had risked clouding discussions was a new law in Indonesia criminalizing sex outside marriage that has sparked fears for foreign visitors to the country.

But Indonesian President Joko Widodo pointedly insisted that the EU-ASEAN relationship needed to be based more on “equality”.

“There must be no imposition of views,” he said. “There must not be one who dictates over the other and thinks that my standard is better than yours.”"

1076297464,20221215,"Leaders from Vietnam and the International Partners Group, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United States, Italy, Canada, Japan, Norway, and Denmark, agreed on the Just Energy Transition Partnership ( ) on December 14.

The partnership will support Vietnam's ambitious net-zero 2050 goal, accelerate the peaking of its greenhouse gas emissions, and transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.

The partnership will support Vietnam in working towards several ambitious new targets, including bringing forward the projected peaking date for all greenhouse gas emissions in Vietnam from 2035 to 2030, reducing peak annual power sector emissions by up to 30 per cent, from 240 megatons to 170 megatons, and bringing forward the peaking date by five years to 2030, limiting Vietnam’s peak coal capacity to 30.2GW down from a current planning figure of 37GW, and accelerating the adoption of renewables so that renewable energy accounts for at least 47 per cent of electricity generation by 2030, up from the current planned generation share of 36 per cent.

The successful delivery of these ambitious targets will save around 500 megatons (0.5 billion tonnes) of emissions by 2035.

Initial contributions to the Vietnam include $7.75 billion in pledges from the IPG together with the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation.

This is supported by a commitment to work to mobilise and facilitate a matching $7.75 billion in private investment from an initial set of private financial institutions coordinated by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, including Bank of America, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Macquarie Group, Mizuho Financial Group, MUFG, Prudential PLC, Shinhan Financial Group, SMBC Group, and Standard Chartered.

Over the next 12 months, Vietnam will work with the support of partner countries to develop and adopt the Vietnam Resource Mobilisation Plan, which will enable JETP funding and strategy implementation.

Vietnam is the third country to launch a JETP, following the successful launch of the South Africa JETP at COP26 and the Indonesia JETP at this year's G20 Leaders' summit. As a rapidly growing economy, Vietnam’s JETP will demonstrate that economic growth can be decoupled from fossil fuel energy consumption.

The Vietnam builds on the UK-launched G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which aims to narrow the infrastructure investment gap in developing countries. G7 leaders agreed in June 2022 to move forward in negotiations with several countries on JETPs.

Ensuring the transition away from fossil fuels is ‘just’ lies at the centre of the . A just transition will not only help Vietnam to its meet climate goals but also secure a resilient and prosperous future for its people, reducing the impacts of pollution and supporting economic growth and new jobs. It is vital that the whole civil society is involved in the green transition at all stages, and no one is left behind.

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said, ""Vietnam is a dynamic, emerging economy at the heart of Southeast Asia. The investment we are making today means the country can cut its emissions while simultaneously creating new jobs and growth.""

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said, ""I am delighted that we have sealed a new Just Energy Transition Partnership with Vietnam during this important week for EU-ASEAN relations. With investments from international partners, Vietnam can boost renewable energy and enhance its energy security and autonomy.""

""We will help Vietnam to start reducing its greenhouse gas emissions five years earlier than planned and dramatically reduce its coal power use. This partnership will help Vietnam to build a 21st-century power sector, energising its economic growth and bringing environmental and health benefits to its citizens,"" she added.

Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, ""Just Energy Transition Partnerships are a model for how contributors can work together with partners like Vietnam to take action towards cleaner energy sources. Canada will continue to be a committed partner for the clean energy transition and coal phase-out in Vietnam, which is in all our best interest for an inclusive, clean energy future in the Indo-Pacific region.""

French President Emmanuel Macron said that France and the European Union were pursuing their strong commitment to climate change mitigation by supporting the acceleration of a just energy transition in Vietnam.

""France’s contribution, which is part of long-standing bilateral cooperation, will support energy planning, capacity building and grid development in parallel with renewable energy development. Our collective contribution must support Vietnam’s commitment to a sustainable development trajectory,"" President Macron said.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pointed out that with Vietnam would support ambitious climate targets and a substantial increase of renewable energies by 2030 as a joint effort to keep 1.5 °C in reach.

Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida Fumio said, ""Japan has been supporting Vietnam‘s decarbonisation through renewable energy-related projects and welcomes Vietnam‘s ambition further to accelerate just energy transition towards net zero by 2050.""

""Japan is proud to be a member of the Just Energy Transition Partnership, which will promote support for low emission and climate-resilient development in Vietnam, in coordination with partner countries, and with further private sector engagement,"" he added.

Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said: ""Norway is proud to be part of the Just Energy Transition Partnership and support Viet Nam’s effort to speed up the energy transition. We believe this can mobilise much-needed private capital to accelerate the ambitious transition from coal to renewable energy.""

President of the United States Joe Biden commented, ""Today, Vietnam has demonstrated leadership in charting an ambitious clean energy transition that will deliver long-term energy security. The United States is proud to be a partner in this effort. Vietnam’s historic commitment will catalyse investment and economic growth and create tremendous opportunity for the Vietnamese while advancing the fight against the global climate crisis.""

Successful delivery of these ambitious targets will result in a cumulative reduction of around 200 megatons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a further 300 megatons by 2035."

Leader Svetlana Tichanovskaya. This would nearly double the funds pledged thus far.

As early as December 2020, Brussels launched support, in particular the “Initiatives of Local Government and Citizens’ Groups” in Belarus. A scholarship program for students and young professionals affected by the political crisis in Belarus, as well as corporate advisory services and support for public health initiatives are also planned.

“Citizens of Belarus have a legitimate right to decide the fate of their country,” von der Leyen said on Twitter. The European Union is on their side.

The European Union accused the governor of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, of electoral fraud and violent suppression of protests critical of the government, and imposed a number of sanctions.

Tichanovskaya fled the country after the controversial presidential elections in Belarus in August 2020. The European Parliament awarded her and members of the Belarusian opposition the Sakharov Prize for Human Rights."

“This is a historic moment for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Now we have to work on the rule of law in that country and that is the cornerstone,” he stressed.

Minister Bek added that the most important thing now is to improve the independence of the judiciary and encourage the culture of the rule of law.

“This must be worked on especially because of the new geopolitical context,” he said.

On Thursday, Bosnia and Herzegovina will definitely receive candidate status for membership in the European Union, according to the leaked draft of the document.

The draft document states that the Council of the European Union proposes to the European Council to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina the status of a candidate country for EU membership.

“Following the conclusions of the European Council of June 23 and 24, 2022, and in the light of the Commission’s subsequent recommendation of October 12, 2022, the Council recommends that the status of a candidate country be granted to Bosnia and Herzegovina, with confirmation by the European Council, with the understanding that steps listed in the Commission’s recommendation to be taken, in order to strengthen the rule of law, the fight against corruption and organized crime, migration management and fundamental rights,” the document states, adding that the Council is looking forward to confirmation by the European Council in December.

The EU Council also emphasizes the urgency for the country to move forward on its path to the EU, especially through the fulfillment of all 14 key priorities for the opening of negotiations on EU accession, and they call on all political leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina to quickly implement the obligations stated in the agreement reached on 12 June 2022 and urgently finalize the constitutional and electoral reform in accordance with key priorities.

 They also welcomed the holding of the elections, which they stated were competitive and well organized but characterized by distrust in public institutions, and the EU’s support for the perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single, united and sovereign state was reiterated.

G7 nations and Norway have pledged to provide Vietnam with $15.5 billion in the next three to five years to help the country accomplish its net-zero emission target in 2050.

Tran Hong Ha, Vietnamese Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, said Thursday that Vietnam and the Group of Seven industrialized nations, which are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., as well as the European Union; and Norway signed the ""Just Energy Transition Partnership"" at the 45th ASEAN – EU Summit in Belgium Wednesday.

The partnership aims to bring forward Vietnam's peak greenhouse gas emissions by five years to 2030, cut emission in its power industry by 30%, or from 240 million tons of CO2 to 170 million tons, by 2030.

It also aims to reduce Vietnam's coal-fired power capacity from the planned 37 GW to 30.2 GW, and boost the ratio of renewable energy in the nation's electricity output from the current 36% to 47% in 2030.

Fulfilling the four tasks will help reduce Vietnam's greenhouse gas emission by around 500 million tons by 2035, the partners said.

According to the environment ministry, around $200 million of the agreed $15.5 billion will be grants and the rest low-interest loans.

Vietnam will have to work with the Western partners next year to build a plan to raise the financial resources.

Two other countries have joined JETP in similar fashion. The G7's deal with Indonesia promised $10 billion in public funds to shut down coal plants there and bring forward the sector's peak emissions by seven years to 2030. South Africa was promised $8.5 billion, according to Reuters."
1076305830,20221215,"Montreal, Dec 15 2022 (IPS) - As the COP entered its crucial second week, negotiations are intensifying now. A slew of new contact groups – meeting mostly behind closed doors – are discussing the minutest details of the Global Biodiversity Framework and the contentious issues within or around it, such as Digital Sequencing Information, Access, and Benefit Sharing. The core aim of all these groups is to talk and resolve all issues and produce a draft treaty that will be acceptable to all parties.

In this flurry of activities, however, there’s an elephant in the room that no one wants to see: The impact of mega infrastructural projects on biodiversity. Leading the table of these most impacting mega projects is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China – the president of COP15.

BRI: A Mammoth Project Like No Other

China launched BRI in 2013, intending to revive and strengthen its trade links with the rest of the world. Today, it’s a mammoth project involving several regions of Asia, Africa and Europe with plans to construct roads, railways, ports, and, more recently, health, digital, and space projects, building physical and economic links, enhancing trade and interconnectivity.

It is, however, not a single Chinese government initiative but consists of many different projects in multiple countries, financed through multiple avenues, including Chinese and international banks and investment funds.

According to a 2019 paper published by the Center for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), the BRI was likely to boost world GDP by $7.1 trillion annually within the next two decades. The Information Office of the Chinese government also reports that BRI has created more than 244,000 jobs for locals abroad.

However, a vast majority of BRI projects require the use of Chinese companies, labour, and raw materials, meaning the GDP gains from BRI will go to the Chinese ‘locals,’ not to the locals of the countries in which China has invested.

Today, at least sixty-four countries fall within its ambit, and the number is increasing. The terrestrial route of BRI aims to cut across Central Asia, Russia, India, Pakistan and Europe, and the maritime route runs along the coast of Asia, East Africa, and Europe.

However, many of these small countries saw themselves falling into mounting debts. The first is Sri Lanka which recently plunged into a financial crisis from debts owed to China for highways, ports, airports, and a coal power plant. Sri Lanka owes China lenders over $7.4 billion – 20% of its total foreign debt. Other countries following the footsteps of Sri Lanka are Kyrgyzstan and Montenegro; while Kyrgyzstan owes 40% of its foreign debt, including $1.8 billion to Chinese lenders, the European Union (EU) refused to pay off a $1 billion Chinese loan for the BRI but has offered help on other infrastructure projects.

The financial crisis put aside, the implication of the BRI on the region’s biodiversity is huge as it includes many different environmentally important areas such as protected areas, key landscapes, Global 200 Ecoregions (a list of ecoregions identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as priorities for conservation), and biodiversity hotspots that cover the distribution range of flagship species. In fact, the study found that 32% of the total area of all protected areas in countries crossed by BRI corridors were potentially affected by the project. There are also areas that are important for delivering ecosystem services that provide social and economic benefits to people.

According to a geospatial study done by WWF, which examined the environmental impacts of BRI, the initiative will affect 1,700 biodiversity hotspots, threaten 265 species, and potentially introduce hundreds of alien species that threaten these fragile ecosystems.

The BRI corridors also overlap with 1,739 Important Bird Areas or Key Biodiversity Areas and 46 biodiversity hotspots or Global 200 Ecoregions5. This is in addition to the range of 265 IUCN threatened species, including 39 critically endangered species and 81 endangered species – including saiga antelopes, tigers and giant pandas.

According to Allie Constantine, Gender and Indigenous rights Advisor to Global Forest Coalition, there is still no impact assessment on how the BRI affects women, and China has not released data on gender and the BRI. However, given that China has signed and ratified most UN human rights treaties, including the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 5 being “Gender Equality”), the country is obliged to report on gender impacts of BRI projects it operates.

While China’s 14th Five-Year plan discusses women’s equality and gender rights, there is no indication of how China will implement or enforce this within the BRI.

“However, even without this data, we can still make certain inferences regarding gendered impacts,” says Constantine, who recently conducted a study on the impact of BRI on women and indigenous peoples in Southeast Asia.

The study reveals that BRI’s expansion through important ecological corridors, including Chinese-backed hydropower projects built along the Mekong River that cause changes in river flow, directly puts specific communities and fragile ecosystems at risk. In turn, this impacts fish migrations and creates a further loss of livelihoods for downstream communities in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam that rely on the river for sustenance.

It also says that specific BRI projects often negatively affect indigenous and forest communities. For example, the Indigenous Mah Meri community in Malaysia is frequently harmed by government processes, including the development of BRI ports in Mah Meri territories. Although Malaysia supports the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), it frequently acts against Indigenous land and human rights, Constantine’s study reveals.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China has been intensifying “Green BRI” efforts, including research on how to make BRI projects more environmentally sound. For example, in 2021, the Chinese ministries of Foreign Commerce and Ecology and Environment released “Green Development Guidelines.” China has also committed to ending coal-fired power plants and investing in renewable energy sources.

Speaking to IPS, Li Shuo, Global Policy Advisor at Greenpeace East Asia, said that within China, there is a growing concern over the country’s investment overseas, especially in high-carbon projects such as coal plants.

“It’s a little hard to say if BRI is a good thing or a bad thing for the local economy or local environment. You have to look at it on a case-by-case basis,“ says Shuo, “But there is a clear recognition that some of the BRI projects are quite problematic from an environmental point of view. I think there is a realization from the Chinese side as well, and that is why a year ago, there was this Chinese commitment to not fund coal-fired power projects. The announcement was made in September 2021 in the UN General Assembly.”

Shuo, however, says that there is still no such recognition or public debate when it comes to biodiversity.

“There is a recognition that China should not invest in high-carbon projects, so there is a slow transition, but on the other hand, where biodiversity is feeding into all these, I think you are in need of more recognition on the Chinese side on the biodiversity implications of the BRI projects. I think climate recognition is slowly getting there but not necessarily on biodiversity. And if you think about it, a lot of the infrastructural projects will have a negative footprint,” Shuo says.

Observers at COP15, however, are saying that with many destructive projects under the BRI, such as large dams built along the Mekong River, which also threaten biodiversity, forests, and forest communities—simply defunding coal and investing in other potentially harmful projects is not the solution.

Infrastructure has not been included in the current biodiversity draft framework. On Dec 8, at a side event of the ongoing COP15, Amy Fraenkel, Executive Secretary, Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), expressed alarm that infrastructure is not addressed in the GBF.

Highlighting that migratory species must be able to reach new habitats, she noted the CMS tackles threats posed to these species by infrastructure. She also called on governments and investors to consider whether there is a real need for new infrastructure developments and to look into alternatives, including “no new infrastructure” options.

Simone Lovera of the Global Forest Coalition has been more vocal in her criticism of BRI, the exclusion of infrastructure in the biodiversity framework and China’s silence on the initiative’s impact on biodiversity. She especially spoke out on how the current financing mechanism – already a contentious issue at COP15 could further fail if mega projects like BRI were continued to be ignored.

“It doesn’t make any sense to just close the financing gap; even US100 billion dollars per year, we have 1.3 trillion US dollars that are going to destructive activities. Sadly, China’s own Belt and Road Initiative is an example of initiatives that are still financing very harmful projects. They are trying to green it up, but they are not doing any gender analysis, and a lot of BRI activities are actually very harmful on the ground. So first and foremost, the thing China should do is look at its own Belt and Road Initiative and make sure that that is aligned. On the one hand, they claim to have ecological civilization at home, but they export the destruction to other countries,” Lovera told IPS News.

Speaking to IPS, Basile Van Havre- Co-chair of the GBF, said negotiators were now “focusing on not adding any new texts to the draft and instead were working to shift as much existing text as possible out of the brackets”. This means if infrastructure has been excluded from the GBF, it is not likely to be included now.

The onus of curbing the harms caused to biodiversity by projects like BRI falls entirely on the countries that own and run them – such as China.

“The European Union just banned commodities that come from deforestation and biodiversity destruction. It’s possible. Let us have an agreement here so they (China) also have a legal alignment. They can say, ‘okay, in line with this multilateral agreement, we will start banning products caused by biodiversity destruction, and I think the EU legislation will show it’s possible. It is a good example, and we very much look at China to do that,” Lovera says."
1076311238,20221215,"The European Union (EU) allocated this year 229 million euros to reinforce much needed reforms and economic development in Lebanon.

It identified several priorities for this new financial package.

“The European Union continues to support Lebanon and its people during challenging socio-economic conditions,” the EU delegation to Lebanon said in a statement on Wednesday, affirming that it remains a committed partner of the country.

It pointed out that the first priority is to enhance good governance and support reforms.

The EU said it will “assist Lebanon in implementing reforms related to public administration focusing on integrity, transparency, and accountability, in line with the opportunities identified by the recent International Monetary Fund Staff-Level Agreement.”

“Our assistance will target civil service reform, public financial management reform and access to public information,” said the EU in a statement.

The EU will also work with state and civil society actors to empower Lebanese women and contribute to gender equality.

Being committed to supporting Lebanon on its reform agenda, the EU will further support the implementation of legislation to protect women from all forms of violence.

Moreover, the statement said: “Under the priority of promoting a green and sustainable recovery, the EU will support Lebanon's green agenda and transition to renewable energy,” adding that it will fund energy efficiency equipment in public sector buildings and contribute to a more efficient provision of public services.

“The EU will also focus on increasing the competitiveness of Lebanese industries, in particular the agro-food sector, by fostering entrepreneurship, innovation and technology transfers for sustainable energy solutions.”

The EU stressed that it will continue to provide significant assistance to vulnerable Lebanese and Syrian refugees and help them access much needed essential services in social protection, education, health, and water provision.

Meanwhile, British Ambassador to Lebanon Hamish Cowell announced a 13 million pounds commitment to support the Lebanese Armed Forces’ (LAF) resilience from 2022 till 2025 in a memorandum of understanding signed with LAF Commander in Chief General Joseph Aoun."
1076311240,20221215,"The European Union has returned to the ritual of sanctioning Iran to leverage its foreign and security policies. The highlight of the EU Foreign Affairs Council ministerial meeting in Brussels on Monday was the imposition of sanctions against Iran over a range of issues.

The issues were“the unacceptable repression of the ongoing protests and the worsening human rights situation” in Iran, its military cooperation with Russia, including delivery of drones deployed against Ukraine, the prospects of renewal of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and regional security.

The council added 20 individuals and one entity to the EU's existing Iran human rights sanctions regime plus four individuals and four entities for the development and delivery of drones used by Russia in Ukraine.

While imposing these sanctions, the EU demands that those responsible for the killing of Mahsa Amini must be held accountable; Iranian authorities should ensure“transparent and credible investigations to clarify the number of deaths and arrests”; and it should release all non-violent protesters and provide due process to all detainees and lift restrictions on internet access and unblock instant-messaging platforms.

The EU Council threatened that it“will consider all the options at its disposal” to address the situation arising out of the death of Mahsa Amini and the way Iranian security forces handled the demonstrations.

Those sanctioned include top executives of Iran Broadcasting,“which is notorious for being a regime mouthpiece,” Iran's deputy minister of interior, and some commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Equally, General Hamid Vahedi, chief of the air force, has been put on the sanctions list for Iran's“military support” for Russia's war in Ukraine.

Ironically, while the EU Council meeting charged ahead on Iran sanctions, it failed to reach consensus on the expected ninth sanctions package on Russia,“against the Kremlin, for escalating its aggression against Ukraine.”

EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the Council of Ministers could not agree“to react to the latest escalation,” but he expected approval of the new tough package this week.

On the whole, Borrell was in a mellowed mood, though, claiming that the EU was making a careful distinction between punishing Iran on its human-rights record and military support to Russia and the Iranian nuclear program.

As he put it,“You will understand that in this situation the JCPOA is in a very difficult situation. But I think that we do not have a better option than the JCPOA to ensure that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. This remains in our own interest.”

Borrell disclosed that he talks“quite often” with Iran's foreign minister and“we share, we disagree, but at least we talk to each other. I think that diplomacy is here to keep the channels of communication open in any circumstances.

“I think that it was good that, before the council took this [sanctions] decision today, i could inform the m inister and he could explain [to] me what is happening and I explain [to] him my concerns. And these concerns brought to these decisions.”

borrell said :“I want to make a clear difference between the nuclear deal ... and the decision taken by the Foreign Affairs Council on the issue of human rights and supply of arms to Russia. They are two different things.

“Certainly, this does not create the best atmosphere to advance in any kind of issue in the relationship between the European Union and Iran. But the nuclear deal is not an issue of the relationship between the European Union and Iran: It is something that goes further, many others are involved. The JCPOA is not just the European Union and Iran.”

Unsurprisingly, Tehran hit back by announcing its own sanctions on several EU and British officials and entities“over their deliberate support of terrorism and terrorist groups, and their incitement to terrorism, violence and hatred, which have caused unrest, violence, terrorist acts and violation of human rights against the Iranian nation.”

Looking ahead, the big question is whether Tehran accepts the“Borrell way” of selective engagement – even if he took his Iranian counterpart into confidence. The EU will selectively engage with Tehran on the JCPOA because it is in the interests of the collective West, especially US President Joe Biden's administration, which would like the door to be kept open to resume the negotiations with Iran in Vienna that were suspended in August.

The energy crisis in Europe is a compelling factor here. Nonetheless, the EU probably also shares the Biden administration's estimation that the current disturbances in Iran cannot be easily suppressed. On the other hand, Tehran cannot be expected to compromise on any perceived challenge to the regime.

Also, the EU may have acted excessively by sanctioning Imam Sayyid Ahmad Khatami, a senior cleric and influential conservative and principalist politician who also happens to be a member of the powerful Guardian Council as well as the Assembly of Experts, who was appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as Tehran's“substitute” Friday-prayer leader in 2005, a position he has held ever since.

In the final analysis, the trail of linkages outlined by Borrell ultimately leads to Moscow. Basically, the EU is messaging that the JCPOA (lifting of Western sanctions) will be conditional on Iran's willingness to roll back its deepening ties with Russia.

The drone part is only the tip of the iceberg; what really causes uneasiness in Washington and Brussels is that Russia may borrow from Iran's toolbox to undercut Western sanctions. Iran's geography as well as its geopolitics makes it a unique partner for Russia. (See my article us internationalizes iran's unrest on Asia Times.)

Tehran is unlikely to budge on its firm handling of the unrest in the country. Indeed, there is remarkable consistency in Iran's political history through the past four decades that there can be no compromises on the challenges to the fundamentals of the regime that came into existence through the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Clearly, the Western powers are barking up the wrong tree – knowingly or unknowingly.

The defiant remarks of IRGC commander-in-chief Major-General Hossein Salami recently – the stark warning by the general that Iran has“achieved all the military technologies in the world” – should leave the Biden administration in no doubt.

That said, on the resumption of the JCPOA talks with the US, Tehran remains interested.

1076309296,20221215,"MONTREAL — A successful biodiversity framework to halt the devastation of global ecosystems and wildlife will require compromise from the world's wealthy and developing nations both, Canada's environment minister said Thursday.

Steven Guilbeault is helping guide international nature talks toward a conclusion, with Canada hosting the COP15 in Montreal despite China remaining the president and chief architect of the summit.

After negotiations temporarily stopped Wednesday amid an impasse over how a resulting framework would be funded, they resumed Wednesday evening and Guilbeault said he is feeling confident that progress is now underway.

But there remains a chasm between wealthier nations and developing countries, with the former demanding a target to protect at least 30 per cent of the world's land and marine areas by 2030 and the latter demanding that the wealthiest countries come up with more cash to pay for it.

A framework won't happen unless both things are included, said Guilbeault.

""Those of us who want ambition, in the north, certainly need to understand that we need to be serious about resource mobilization, and those countries in the south who want resources to be mobilized need to understand that there won't be money unless there's ambition,"" he said.

The Montreal talks began Dec. 6 with country negotiators taking the lead, and government ministers arrived Thursday for a three-day ""high-level segment"" aimed at bringing the toughest issues to a consensus.

Guilbeault said the hope is that a compromise agreement will be ready by Sunday, a day before the meeting is supposed to end.

But the finance issue still looms large, as does the amount of money required.

Estimates suggest US$700 billion a year is needed to properly conserve nature. About $200 billion of that would come from contributions from governments, the private sector and charities, while the rest could be achieved by redirecting government subsidies that harm nature, such as those for fossil-fuel projects.

That is on top of the commitment to fund climate action and adaptation measures at US$100 billion a year.

Developed countries are adamant that they cannot fund it all.

""It's doable, but not just with public money,"" Guilbeault said in an interview with The Canadian Press.

Developed countries are counting on private-sector financing and philanthropy to help bridge the gap, though Guilbeault acknowledged that the business case isn't as easy to make for conserving nature as it is for developing clean technology to help slow climate change.

Lord Zac Goldsmith, the British minister for international environment and climate, said Thursday that to put the size of the need into perspective, the annual total of all government aid for everything — not just nature and climate — is US$160 billion.

""So even if we quadrupled all global aid and put all of it into nature, we still wouldn't quite get there in terms of closing that gap,"" Goldsmith said.

Canada and the U.K. were among a group of developed nations that issued what they called a ""donor statement"" on Thursday, trying to prove they aren't falling down on financing commitments.

It lists a number of existing pledges — including 7 billion euros from the European Commission between 2021 and 2017 — and a handful of new ones made in Montreal.

Early last week, Canada said it will increase its global environment financing by another $350 million, specifically to help implement a biodiversity framework in developing countries. Japan said Thursday it will increase its biodiversity financing by 114 billion yen, the equivalent of about $1.2 billion, between 2023 and 2025.

The ""joint donor statement"" calls the commitments ""a major breakthrough in addressing the twin challenges of climate change and nature loss as the world sees mass species extinctions and habitat loss accelerate at an alarming rate.""

The money aside, there is also a disagreement about how any funds would actually be disbursed. Developing countries want a new biodiversity fund, because they say existing mechanisms are too slow. Wealthier nations do not want to create a new fund.

Virginijus Sinkevičius, the European environment commissioner, said he knows the biggest need is to make finance flow more efficiently, but that doesn't have to require a new fund.

""What's very important is not to concentrate on new funds, which you know, the old problems are not going to be gone with them,"" he said. ""We have to look at the innovative mechanisms, which can help African countries, Latin American, countries in Southeast Asia to have accessibility to funds sooner than they have now.""

Destruction of nature has serious consequences for human health and prosperity, affecting everything from clean air and clean water to food security and economic growth.

The destruction of and human encroachment into wild ecosystems is also creating health risks due to animal-borne viruses, an issue many people are more acutely aware of as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

1076318584,20221215,"The parliament of the Republic of Lithuania (hereinafter – the Parliament) on 15 December 2022 passed a legislation, in accordance with Council of the European Union’s regulation, establishing an EUR 180 per MWh price cap for producers generating electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biomass, waste, nuclear energy, lignite, crude petroleum products, peat. According to the assessment of AB “Ignitis grupė” (hereinafter – the Group), such legislation will not have a significant effect on the Group’s performance.

On 6 October 2022, the Council of the European Union adopted Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. In order to introduce the regulation into national law, which would detail the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 and determine specific implementation and application model, the Parliament has passed a law “On the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854” and a law amending the Law on Corporate Income Tax of the Republic of Lithuania which will enter into force on 1 January 2023. The laws stipulate temporary legal regulation, which will apply only while the Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 is in effect – until 30 June 2023 with an option to extend the regulation until 31 December 2023 (with exceptions).

The law of the Republic of Lithuania “On the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854” details the implementation of the mandatory cap of 180 EUR/MWh on market revenues established in Article 6(1) of the Regulation (EU) 2022/1854:
• revenue surplus shall be collected from producers who generate electricity from the sources referred to in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) 2022/1854, i.e., wind energy, solar energy (solar thermal and solar photovoltaic), geothermal energy, hydropower without reservoir, biomass fuel (solid or gaseous biomass fuels), excluding biomethane, waste, nuclear energy, lignite, crude petroleum products, peat;
• it also details the main principles for determining and calculating revenue surplus as well as other principles.

A detailed methodology for determining market revenue and calculating revenue surplus as well as revenue surplus declaration form and declaration frequency will be introduced by the National Energy Regulatory Council by the end of December 2022.

The Group notes that the aforementioned legislation shall not apply to the electricity generated and transmitted by Kruonis PSHP and Elektrėnai complex. Additionally, the majority of electricity the Group is planning to generate and sell in 2023 which is subject to this regulation due to the aforementioned legislation is under power purchase agreements (PPA). The price of such agreements usually does not exceed 180 EUR/MWh. Due to the reasons above, the Group does not expect a significant impact on its performance after the aforementioned regulation enters into force."
1076318587,20221215,"The story of Sadro Ursu and its co-founder and director Simion Ursu is one of continuous development.

Formerly a chemistry teacher, Simion quickly adapted to the new reality brought about to his home country of Moldova by the political situation of the 1990s. Now he is the co-founder of a company producing popcorn, sour soups, potato chips, carton cups for hot and cold and drinks, and bucket containers. Sadro Ursu is a family company, with Simion’s wife and daughter actively involved in running the business, including its finance and development strategy.

Together with the European Union and Sweden, the EBRD has helped his company to invest in a more energy efficient future.

“I began my entrepreneurial journey when people in commerce were no longer looked down on for their occupation. It was a time of change in the late ’80s to early ’90s,” says Simion.

He, along with his wife, Rodica, started first by importing food and gradually, step by step, expanded operations.

“We are a family business and this has not been an easy experience. Our company requires 24/7 attention, but it is also easier to be industrious and try new things,’’ he notes.

Sadro Ursu is a company that exports most of its products to countries in both its neighbourhood and the European Union also and imports raw material from abroad.

Producing carton items requires particular attention, Simion notes. His suppliers from Lithuania, Spain, Germany and Finland follow a rigorous tracking system to demonstrate that raw materials come from responsibly managed sources.

With mounting demand for their products, Simion decided it was time to amp up the volume of production, and partners such as the EBRD and its donors were there to support these investments.

For the company, this meant boosted production volumes and reduced energy consumption and bills.

The EBRD helps businesses in Moldova, and also in Armenia, Georgia and Ukraine, to reap the benefits of investing in greener, energy-saving technologies, thus improving their competitiveness in local and external markets.

The EU4Business-EBRD Credit Line offers companies access to finance via partner financial institutions to build modern, well-equipped enterprises. Employees can learn much from state-of-the-art equipment, master new skills and become an even more competitive, skilled workforce, while also enjoying a secure working environment.

On top of that, the companies receive up to 15 per cent cashback on their investment, funded by the European Union under its EU4Business initiative. To date, roughly 350 Moldovan small and medium-sized enterprises have benefitted from the EBRD programme.

The equipment not only boosted the production volume of Sadro Ursu by a factor of four but led to significantly reduced energy costs. At the moment, the new equipment is up to 26 per cent more energy efficient than the older production lines. Moldova depends highly on energy imports, and with the current volatile energy market, every saving matters.

In addition, prior to the investment, a major study through the EBRD’s Women in Business Programme, with funding from Sweden, has guided the company on how to best introduce energy efficiency engineering solutions for the reconstruction and expansion of the existing production facilities.

“For a business such as ours, constant change and development is very important. We had small beginnings but have managed to overcome difficulties and grow in a responsible, sustainable way. Going solar is the next, big step for us,’’ Simion concludes."

1076322612,20221215,"The Greek Foreign Ministry has called on Azerbaijan to reopen the Lachin corridor ""without preconditions"" so that the local population can be ""spared from hardships and distress.""

""Greece calls on Azerbaijani authorities to ensure freedom and security of movement and transport, in both directions along the Lachin corridor without any preconditions in compliance with the Tripartite Statement of 09.11.20. Local population should be spared from hardships and distress,"" the ministry said in a social media post.

At the same time, Russia expressed concern on Thursday over the blocking of the Lachin Corridor which links Armenia to the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The route is the only land connection across Azerbaijani territory between Armenia and the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of blocking it, which Baku denies.

At a briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia hopes the corridor will be unblocked soon.

Hostilities between the two countries persist despite a September ceasefire that came after Azerbaijan launched another unprovoked attack on Armenia, escalating a decades-long dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, the population of which is predominantly indigenously Armenian.

""Closure of the Lachin Corridor has severe humanitarian implications and sets back the peace process,"" U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said. ""We call on the government of Azerbaijan to restore free movement through the corridor.""

The European Union also issued a statement, calling on ""the Azerbaijani authorities to ensure freedom and security of movement along the corridor.""

A trilateral agreement signed by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia in 2020 to end a large-scale war stated that the Lachin Corridor would remain under the control of Russian peacekeepers and that Azerbaijan had to guarantee the safe movement of citizens, vehicles and cargo in both directions.

Armenia's Foreign Ministry said, ""The propagandistic preparations for closing the Lachin Corridor started months ago and it is obvious that this provocation was organised by the state bodies of Azerbaijan, aiming to cut off Nagorno-Karabakh from the Republic of Armenia and thus from the outside world.""

Schools in Nagorno-Karabakh are being shut down, Artsakh State Minister Ruben Vardanyan announced Wednesday, adding that residents should conserve electricity.

Some families are now cut off from one another, including Artak Beglaryan, Advisor to State Minister of Nagorno-Karabakh, who is stranded in Yerevan after being unable to reenter Karabakh.

Beglaryan, who called for international sanctions, started a sit-in protest in front of the United Nations office in Armenia’s capital.

1076326991,20221215,"PRESIDENT Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. returned to the country on Thursday evening from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-the European Union (Asean-EU) Summit in Brussels, Belgium.

Marcos, along with several Cabinet members and other delegates, arrived past at 6:58 p.m at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.

The summit gave Marcos the opportunity to put forward the country's stance on pressing global issues as well as its plans, including post-pandemic recovery, with fellow world leaders.

Marcos had bilateral meetings with leaders from Belgium, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Finland, the Netherlands and the European Union.

The President also had the chance to invite business leaders to do business in the country during his trip to Belgium.

In a statement, Office of the Press Secretary officer-in-charge Cheloy Garafil said Marcos secured a P4.7-billion investment from multinational consumer goods company, Unilever.

The deal was secured during a meeting between Marcos and officials of Unilever on the sidelines of Asean-EU summit.

""I think that we have a good opportunity with some of the policy measures that have been taken from the previous administration and some of the policy changes that we have made at the beginning of this administration,"" Marcos told Unilever officials.

The President also secured an investment pledge on renewable energy and infrastructure from Acciona, a Spanish multinational firm specializing in the development and management of infrastructure and renewable energy.

In his remarks, the President acknowledged that ""there has been a lot of progress in that regard, but we need to do more in terms of building up our renewables.""

""There is this move to renewables, so we have to adjust... we'll have to increase our capacity for production,"" Marcos told Acciona officials.

""These are all relevant to the Philippines, and I hope that I'll be able to see you there... your operations in these specific areas,"" he added.

Aside from Unilever and Acciona, Marcos also met with business leaders from other European-based companies namely Ocea and Semmaris.

Ocea is a French multinational company that specializes in maritime safety, security and navigation as well as shipbuilding and integrated logistics support.

""The company plans to develop a shipyard in the Philippines with an investment of P1.5 billion which is expected to create 500 to 600 direct and indirect jobs,"" the Palace said.

On the other hand, Semmaris is a France-based company that manages the Rungis International Market, the world's largest fresh produce market located in Paris, France.

The company also ensures the development, commercialization and promotion of the Market's infrastructure, as well as the security of its tenants.

""As a logistics hub management company, Semmaris plans to develop an agro-logistics service in New Clark City, Tarlac that will build and operate a wholesale market for fresh products with an organized and efficient food supply and value chain,"" the Palace said.

After meeting with business executives, Marcos also participated in the Asean-EU Commemorative Summit where he discussed on several occasions at the plenary.

He joined European Council President Charles Michel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia in a press conference after the Summit proper."
1076326994,20221215,"DONETSK (Reuters): Ukrainian forces staged their heaviest shelling attack in years in the country’s Russian-controlled east on Thursday, Moscow-installed officials said, as both sides ruled out a Christmas truce in the nearly 10-month-old war.

Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-backed mayor of Donetsk city, said 40 rockets were fired from BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers at civilians in the city centre in the early hours.

Meanwhile Russian forces kept up shelling and air strikes along the entire eastern front line, killing one person, while two were killed in the southern city of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said.

Moscow and Kyiv are not currently engaged in talks to end Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two, which is raging mainly in the east and south of Ukraine with little movement on either side.

“The Kremlin… is seeking to turn the conflict into a prolonged armed confrontation,” a senior Ukrainian officer, Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov, told a news briefing on Thursday. He also dismissed the possibility of a truce over the festive period.

On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said a Christmas ceasefire was “not on the agenda”.

Kulemzin cast the Donetsk attack as a war crime and said it was the biggest on the city since 2014, when pro-Moscow separatists seized it from Kyiv’s control. Preliminary estimates showed five people had been hurt, including a child, he said.

There was no immediate Ukrainian response to his comments.

Ukraine’s military General Staff said in its daily report that Moscow’s focus remained on the eastern cities of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, adding that Ukrainian forces had repelled Russian attacks in the past 24 hours.

It also said Russian forces continued to strike Ukrainian troops and civilian infrastructure in the Donetsk region and in the southern areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

“The Russians fired at different areas along the entire front line all night and in the morning,” the Ukrainian governor of Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on the Telegram messaging app, adding there had been two air strikes on Avdiivka.

One person was killed and four injured near Bakhmut, he said, adding: “It is dangerous to stay in the Donetsk region! Evacuate in time!”

Separately, Russian shelling killed two people in the centre of Kharkiv, the southern city liberated by Ukraine last month,” said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office.

Reuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield accounts from either side.

“There is no calm on the front line,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Wednesday video address, saying Russian artillery attacks on towns in the east had left “only bare ruins and craters”.

He said this week that Russia should start withdrawing by Christmas as a step to end the conflict, but Moscow rejected the proposal, saying Ukraine must first accept the loss of territory.

The United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk said in a speech to the Rights Council following a visit to Ukraine that Russia’s strikes were exposing millions to “extreme hardship”.

On Wednesday, Kyiv suffered the first major drone attack in weeks. Two administrative buildings were hit, but air defences largely repelled the attack. Zelenskiy said 13 drones had been shot down.

In one snowy Kyiv district, residents said they heard the loud whirring engine of an Iranian Shahed drone followed by a powerful explosion at a building next to their homes.

“I want this all to be over … For (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, that bastard, to die,” said Yana, 39, who had been getting ready for work when the attack took place.

Tens of thousands of people have been killed, millions more displaced and cities reduced to rubble since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in a “special military operation”, saying it needed to protect Russian speakers from Ukrainian nationalists. Kyiv and its allies call it an unprovoked war of aggression.

Russia has fired barrages of missiles on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure since October, disrupting power supplies and leaving people without heating in freezing winter conditions.

National grid operator Ukrenergo said on Thursday Ukraine continued to suffer a “significant” deficit of electricity due to the strikes, including new ones in the east, adding that the situation was complicated by poor weather conditions.

In a move that would significantly bolster Ukraine’s air defence, U.S. officials told Reuters that a decision on providing the Patriot missile system to the Ukrainian military could be announced as soon as Thursday.

The Kremlin said the United States was getting “deeper and deeper into the conflict in the post-Soviet republic”, and that U.S. Patriot systems would be legitimate targets, something that Russia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday applied to all weapons supplied to Ukraine by the West.

European Union member states failed to agree on a ninth package of Russia sanctions in talks late on Wednesday, diplomats said, after Poland called for a tougher stance.

Member states disagree over whether the EU should make it easier for Russian fertiliser exports to pass through European ports to help poorer countries even if the fertiliser companies concerned are owned by blacklisted oligarchs.

Further financial and military aid to Ukraine will feature prominently on the agenda of EU leaders meeting in Brussels for a summit later on Thursday."
1076330962,20221215,"The European Union has taken legal action against British-Swedish vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca. A spokesman said the group had failed to abide by the handover contract. AstraZeneca rejects the allegation.

The European Union has filed a lawsuit against vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca over major delivery delays. The European Union Commission has filed a lawsuit against the British Swedish company. This was announced by a UNHCR spokesperson. All 27 EU countries will support the move.

AstraZeneca has not held the contract to supply Covid-19 vaccines and does not have a “reliable” plan to deliver them on time in the future.

Under the contract, the company committed to deliver 180 million doses of the vaccine to the European Union “at its best” in the second quarter of this year. However, in a statement released on March 12 this year, the company said it intends to deliver only a third of it.

A week later, the European Union Commission sent a letter to the company in the first step of the official dispute settlement procedure. The lawsuit is now the next step. However, this should not change anything regarding delivery backlog.

The relationship between the EU Commission and the company has been tense for a long time – also because Great Britain has not been affected much by delivery problems. Therefore, the European Union has introduced an export control mechanism. Delivery of 250,000 AstraZeneca packages from Italy to Australia has been banned.

AstraZeneca: We keep our agreements

AstraZeneca has now justified its approach. According to the company’s reaction to the Brussels announcement, the company has complied with the contract with the European Union Commission and will defend itself in court. “We believe this litigation is unfounded and we welcome the opportunity to resolve this dispute as soon as possible,” AstraZeneca said.

According to forecasts, nearly 50 million doses of vaccine will be delivered to European Union countries by the end of April. They are also working to increase production as quickly as possible.

A large portion of the vaccine that is currently being injected in the European Union comes from the German manufacturer BioNTech and its American partner, Pfizer. In addition to AstraZeneca, preparations from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson also have European approval.

AstraZeneca is now only used on a limited scale in many European Union countries because it has been linked to very rare cases of cerebral venous thrombosis. However, it is still unrestrictedly approved by the European Union Medicines Agency (EMA)."
1076329030,20221215,"Yesterday, global leaders from organisations representing seafarers, shipowners and other maritime employers, met with His Excellency President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr, as part of his foreign policy tour in Brussels.

President Marcos ordered a new advisory board to be made up of employers, shipowners and unions and the ILO, to give expert advice on major maritime issues.

Reform was urged of the country’s seafarer claims industry where ambulance-chasing lawyers target seafarers in order to defraud employers.

The Philippines is one of the major suppliers of maritime labour globally.

Marcos pledges action to stave off EMSA threat to 50,000 jobs

Top of the agenda was the immediate concern of employers and crew that as many as 50,000 seafarers faced being barred from crewing European Union-flagged vessels over qualification issues.

The threat is due to a warning from the bloc’s maritime regulator that the Philippines needed to address unacceptable deficiencies in crew’s education, training and certification. Failure to do so would push out Filipino seafarers, a labour source so critical that one delegate described as ‘too big to fail’.

Delegates were reassured to hear Marcos pledge that his administration will do “everything” to address these deficiencies identified by the European Commission’s Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) “to prevent job losses among Filipino seafarers,” he said.

Delegates also urged Marcos to defend Filipino jobs, by reforming the country’s problematic seafarers claims industry.

While intended to secure speedy resolution and compensation for injured and aggrieved crew, the injury claims industry system today sees seafarers’ hardship and goodwill exploited by ambulance-chasing lawyers.

The victimisation of Filipino Seafarers by people or groups to make fraudulent and costly injury claims against their employers, has resulted in companies to look elsewhere for their seafarer workforce.

In 2000, Filipino crew made up 28.5% of the global seafarer population, however by 2020, that figure had dropped to just 14%. Any further decline would jeopardise the $6.54b USD in wages Filipino seafarers send home each year to their families – money critical to the Philippines economy.

Seafarers’ unions, including Philippines-based AMOSUP have supported employers’ calls for a crackdown on the unethical practices of the claims industry, who, they say, “capitalise on the hardships and even the demise of seafarers.”

ITF, ICS and IMEC called upon to form Marcos’ new maritime advisory committee

President Marcos also revealed to the delegates that he had ordered his Department of Migrant Workers minister, Secretary Susan ‘Toots’ Ople, to establish a maritime advisory committee to address the training issue and consider reforms to the broken seafarers’ claims system.

The International Advisory Committee on Global Maritime Affairs (IACGMA) will draw on experts from both industry and the workforce to support the Philippines’ government. IMEC, ICS, ITF and the International Labor Organization will all be invited to share their expertise.

The committee’s advice could be key as the Philippines, like other global maritime leaders, looked to navigate its way through the challenges of the future, such as climate change.

A recent Maritime Just Transition report revealed that as many as 800,000 seafarers will need some form of training or familiarisation by the mid-2030s to handle the fuels, technology and vessels of the future. Understanding what was needed for the Philippines to make the most of the opportunity decarbonization provides, would be critical to securing an equitable and sustainable future for its seafarers and the industry.

The meeting with the President in Belgium represents the first official engagement of IMEC, the ICS and ITF, with a national leader since the bodies recently signed an MOU with the aim of maximising the impact of their advocacy efforts on behalf of crew and industry.

1076332911,20221215,"The overwhelming driver of global climate breakdown is burning fossil fuels — coal, oil, and methane gas. Not surprisingly, there is an intensifying global fight over which fossil fuel should be eliminated first. Canada has been leading a push to single out coal as the first fossil fuel to go. Others, including India and the European Union, are pushing back — insisting the world ramp down all fossil fuels together. In this battle, coal often gets portrayed as the most CO2-intensive fossil fuel (i.e., emitting the most CO2 per unit of energy). Rarely mentioned, however, is the fact that gasoline is far worse. Here are the numbers. My first chart shows the CO2 intensity for both fuels.



Coal is shown on the left in purple. The vast majority of the world's coal is burned to create electricity. Coal power plants emit around 1,000 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour of usable energy produced (gCO2 per kWh).

Gasoline's CO2 intensity is shown on the right in the tall dark grey bar. Burning gasoline in a vehicle's smaller and less-efficient power plant (a.k.a., internal combustion engine) emits around 1,300 gCO2 per kWh. That's one-third more climate-polluting than coal.



And when you include ""upstream"" emissions from producing both fuels, gasoline is 50 per cent worse than coal. These upstream emissions are shown by the lighter tops of each bar. Coal takes very little energy to produce compared to gasoline, so it has much smaller upstream emissions.



(Note: In this article, I've used the term ""gasoline"" as shorthand to represent both gasoline and diesel road fuels. They have similar CO2 intensities, as discussed in the endnotes.) Shell Canada snaps up gas stations in preparation for energy transition Roughly half of the world’s oil gets turned into gasoline and burned in vehicles to move them around. Despite this being a primary global use of fossil fuels, I've never seen the CO2 intensity for gasoline power listed. Fortunately, it is simple to calculate from government data. If you are interested in the nitty-gritty of the carbon math, I've included it all in the endnotes.

The main thing you need to know to understand why gasoline is so much worse is that vehicle engines are only half as efficient as coal power plants. That means you need to burn far more carbon fuel — and, thus, emit far more CO2 — in a vehicle engine than in a coal power plant to produce the same amount of energy. In fact, just 20 per cent of the energy in gasoline makes it to the wheels. That's extremely wasteful, expensive, and polluting. Canada wants the world to target coal first A few years ago, Canada and the U.K. teamed up to launch a Powering Past Coal Alliance. It targets the worldwide elimination of coal power as ""the first step"". As Canada pushes the world to eliminate coal first, we should take an honest look at our own gasoline emissions, which are even more CO2-intensive than coal and surging out of control. @bsaxifrage writes for @NatObserver. #Analysis Both these nations, however, rely on coal for just a tiny sliver of their energy use. In contrast, people living in lower-income nations disproportionately depend on coal to power their lives. My next chart puts some numbers on this economic divide. The height of each bar on the chart shows the percentage of total energy use that comes from burning coal.

The purple bar on the left shows the role of coal in the 38 nations in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). These are predominantly high-income, developed economies. Canada is one of them. Collectively, these nations produce around half the world's GDP. Together, they rely on coal for only 12 per cent of their energy.



The role of coal in the rest of the world is represented by the taller bar on the right. This lower-income group is three times more coal-dependent — relying on coal for an average of 36 per cent of their energy.



An even more extreme divide is shown by the two yellow bull's-eyes on the chart. They show Canada gets just three per cent of its energy from coal, while India relies on coal for 57 per cent. So, it's not hard to understand why India is pushing back on Canadian efforts to single out coal from the other fossil fuels. And speaking of those other fossil fuels, it turns out that Canadians burn a whole lot of them.

My last chart lets you compare fossil fuel burning per capita in Canada and India. The height of the bars shows the total energy from each type of fossil fuel — in gigajoules (GJ) per year.



The tiny bar on the left shows India burns relatively small amounts of fossil fuels — just 24 GJ worth in total. The purple part shows how extremely coal-reliant they are.



The towering bar on the right shows that Canadians burn 10 times more fossil fuels per person than people in India do.



And the dark grey part of Canada's bar shows that 110 GJ comes just from burning fossil oil — nearly all of which is gasoline. So we are burning seven times more fossil fuels per person in the form of oil than Indians are burning in the form of coal.



And as we saw earlier, gasoline is the far more climate-polluting fuel per unit of energy. It is certainly true that coal CO2 must ramp down quickly if we want any shot at avoiding a full-blown climate catastrophe. But that is also true for the CO2 from all fossil fuels — including dirtier-than-coal gasoline. Here's some additional information for those wanting a deeper dive into the carbon math, data, and sources. Coal power plants convert ~36 per cent to ~47 per cent of the heat energy in coal into work energy (electricity). The global average for older, sub-critical plants is 36 per cent. The newer super-critical ones are around 44 per cent efficient. And the best new ultra-super-critical plants achieve 47 per cent. In this article and charts, I used 36 per cent because it closely matches real-world stats for the United States.



Gasoline engines are only half as efficient as coal power plants. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, vehicle engines convert around ~20 per cent of the heat energy in gasoline into work energy (to turn wheels). Their efficiency ranges from 16 per cent to 25 per cent depending on driving conditions. In this article, I used 20 per cent for the calculations and charts. The remaining 80 per cent of the energy in gasoline isn't used. It turns into waste heat that we don't want. This waste heat is expensive in several ways. Gasoline vehicles require complicated systems to get rid of all this unwanted heat — engine oil, radiators, and exhaust/mufflers. In addition, drivers of gasoline burners need to buy five times more energy than is actually needed to move the vehicle. In contrast, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are ~90 per cent efficient. So, drivers don't need to buy as much extra energy to run them. That's the reason BEVs are so much cheaper to run. You may have read or heard somewhere that coal is more carbon-intensive than gasoline. That's only true if you are trying to heat with them. In that case, coal does emit more. The numbers: coal emits ~340 gCO2 per kWh of heat; gasoline emits ~260 gCO2 per kWh of heat. But almost no one burns gasoline for heat. So it doesn't matter what the carbon intensity is for that. Instead, nearly all gasoline gets burned to move vehicles. And burning gasoline to move vehicles is hugely inefficient. As a result, the CO2 intensity for what gasoline is actually used for — moving vehicles — is many times higher than for heating. Likewise, the vast majority of the coal in the world isn't burned to create heat. It's burned to create electricity. And the CO2 intensity of coal power plants is a commonly measured and published metric that specifically lists CO2 emitted per unit of electricity produced — not per unit of heat. In the article, I only discussed ""gasoline"" for simplicity and because 95 per cent of passenger vehicles in Canada burn gasoline. It is often stated that diesel engines can be a bit less CO2-intensive than gasoline engines. But studies of real-world driving show most or all this benefit gets lost before getting to the wheels. For example, this study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) concluded: ""A modern gasoline vehicle can have the same or even lower CO2 emissions than a comparable diesel version."" One big reason is that diesel vehicles require a lot of extra energy to filter out the higher levels of NOx gases. Trying to avoid paying that energy penalty was the motivation behind the Dieselgate emissions cheating scandal by VW and others a few years ago. In addition, diesel vehicles are often heavier and have more powerful engines, further eroding the real-world efficiency for them. Upstream emissions are emitted during the extracting, refining, and transporting of coal and gasoline. Here are the values I used in my calculations and charts:
• Coal 3% — This was an average from the ""Life Cycle Assessment of Coal-fired Power Production"" (pdf) by the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
• Gasoline 25% — This is what the U.S. EPA uses when determining the life cycle emissions for gasoline (website)."

The Austrian chancellor insisted that a deal must be reached that would match the reasonable price of the gas without jeopardizing the security of the supply.

The day before, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed optimism that the price ceiling on gas could be reached. The European Union leaders gathered for a two-day summit in Brussels to also discuss the ninth package of sanctions against Russia."
1076341125,20221215,"DrSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic called on NATO to protect the Serb minority in Kosovo from attacks. Vucic said in a televised address on Sunday that if the Western military alliance fails to do the job, Serbia may have to intervene on its own. “We will protect our people from persecution and massacres if NATO does not want to do so.” The KFOR multinational force of approximately 4,000 soldiers is stationed in Kosovo under NATO command.

Kosovo seceded from Serbia in 1999 and declared independence in 2008, but this was never recognized by the government in Belgrade, nor was Serbia’s important ally Russia. For years, the European Union has tried to normalize relations between the two countries, which Brussels sees as one of the preconditions for possible membership in the alliance of nations. The crisis meeting in Brussels on Thursday ended without agreement, and involved disagreement over new rules for Serbs’ entry into Kosovo.

In his speech, Vucic claimed that “gangs” of Kosovar Albanians are invading northern Kosovo, where most Serbs live. This must stop. No evidence was provided for this. At the same time, the Serbian president also confirmed that his government will work towards a compromise in the dispute over entry rules before they come into effect on 1 September."

1076343123,20221215,"The European Commission has long been calling for qualified majority voting in the EU in a number of areas, and EU citizens backed a move away from unanimity at the conference on the future of Europe, EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni told a European Parliament plenary session on Wednesday.

During the debate on “Protecting the European Union against the abuse of national vetoes,” the commission said it was compatible with the current treaty rules. He said the EU would also benefit from qualified majority voting in areas such as energy policy, tax policy, common foreign and security policy sanctions, and human rights.

Gentiloni recalled that the main changes introduced by the 2007 Lisbon Treaty included an increase in qualified majority voting in the EU Council and a stronger role for the European Parliament in decision-making. He noted that

Gentiloni stressed that the committee supports the extension of qualified majority voting and will work with the other EU institutions on the issue. “The European Commission will always support those who would reform the European Union to make it work better,” he said.

In her speech, Hungarian Fidesz MEP Kinga Gál stressed that the double standards set up in the European Union on the veto issue are unacceptable. “It is serious hypocrisy that while some new, mostly Eastern European Member States of the EU are accused of destroying European unity and vetoing when they courageously stand up for their positions and values, old Member States can do so without consequences in much more serious matters. T hese instances can only be called ‘lack of agreement,’ never a veto, ” she pointed out.

In her view, the very title of the plenary debate reflects this bias and is misleading for political purposes. What is being called a veto here by the liberal mainstream is nothing other than the unanimous decision enshrined in the Treaties, which is the basis for good faith cooperation,” she pointed out.

She argued that the abolition of unanimous decision-making would remove the sovereignty of the Member States and would mean the completion of centralization in Brussels. “It would discourage dissent and disagreement and undermine European unity. The EU cannot become a United States of Europe serving federalist interests,” added Gál.

After a speech by Gál, Austrian politician, formerly of the Austrian People’s Party, and EPP MEP Othmar Karas, who chaired the debate, drew the attention of the plenary that “the position of the European Parliament is very clear and the outcome of the conference on the future of Europe is clear: a veto is a veto and we want a more democratic Europe.”

The EU’s aim has always been to accompany integration with democratization, and unanimous decision-making does not fit in with parliamentary democracy. He noted that his criticism was not only directed at Hungary, but also at the Netherlands and his own country, Austria.

In a Facebook post, Gál responded that in her opinion, Karas had gone way beyond his remit with his comment. “Mr President, you are fundamentally ignorant of the workings of the European Union.

You talk about deepening democracy when you want to silence your dissenting colleagues. What is a dictatorship if not this?”, the Fidesz MEP added in the post."

According to him, 75,000 people entered the European Union and crossed it into Austria without being registered. He did not mention a period. “It is a security problem and it must be resolved,” Nehammer said.

Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary should be supported in border security. “These are countries that have to protect the external borders in this sense for all of us who are landlocked. We see that there are problems here, and there is a shortage.”

According to preliminary data from the EU border protection agency Frontex, there were more than 308,000 irregular border crossings into the EU in the first eleven months of the year. This represents an increase of 68 percent compared to the same period last year. On the Western Balkan route alone, 45 percent of these people came to the EU, mostly from Syria, Afghanistan, Turkey and Tunisia. 2022 will likely be the year with the highest number of irregular border crossings since 2016, Frontex announced at the start of the week."

Marcos, along with several Cabinet members and other delegates, returned to the country on Thursday evening from his participation at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-the European Union (Asean-EU) Summit in Brussels, Belgium.

In his arrival speech, the President described his trip ""as very productive"" as he exchanged views ""on what is in store for Asean-EU cooperation, particularly on areas of mutual interest and concern such as connectivity, trade, digital transition, food security, climate change, geopolitics, amongst others.""

""I was honored to deliver one of the opening remarks during the Commemorative Summit, in which I was proud to note the recent milestones in Asean-EU relations under the Philippines' coordinatorship – the adoption of the Asean-EU Plan of Action for 2023 to 2027 and the successful conclusion of the first-ever Summit between Asean and EU Leaders,"" Marcos said.

""And this is a very significant development that EU has turned very, very distinctly towards the Asia-Pacific region when it comes to the driving force behind the new global economy. And this is not really surprising considering that in terms of geopolitical aggrupation, the EU and the Asean are two of the most active, best organized, and cohesive organizations in the world,"" he added.

The President said this is a very important partnership ""because it is servicing over billions and billions of people both in Europe and in the Asia-Pacific.""

He also welcomed the adoption of the Joint Leaders' Statement at the Asean-EU Commemorative Summit, which is the product of intensive discussions between Asean and EU Member States.

At the 10th Asean-EU Business Summit, Marcos said he shared the Philippines' perspective on deepening Asean-EU trade through efforts in sustainable development, which is the theme of the Business Summit spearheaded by the Asean-EU Business Council.

""The Asean-EU Business Council has a pivotal role to play in advancing Asean's regional economic integration and post-pandemic economic recovery efforts, through its various initiatives and valuable recommendations, which have been very useful in terms of prioritizing areas and initiatives for Asean's regional economic integration,"" he said.

The President said he also met with several business leaders from different European companies during his visit.

""All of them committed to be a part of our development and our economic growth, particularly in renewable energy, infrastructure, food security [and] climate change initiatives,"" he said.

""With European technology and innovation with Filipino talent and ingenuity and industry, we will be working on addressing some of our key economic challenges,"" he added.

The President also announced that they have met with various leading shipowners all over Europe and ""we were able to get their commitment to help our country hurdle some of the challenges in our seafarers' EMSA accreditation through the creation of an advisory council composed of our concerned government agencies, international and local shipowners and other stakeholders.""

""Beyond that, I was able to meet with the EU Commission President, President Ursula von der Leyen who is actually in charge of the – it is the Commission, it's not the EU. They are the ones who actually are the ones who provide that accreditation,"" Marcos said.

""So I explained to her what we have done, that we have this new advisory council and she made a promise that she would – that the Commission itself would provide technical help to us so that within the three months – we have a three-month deadline – within the three months that we will be able to remedy all of the deficiencies that EMSA has been pointing out and hopefully we finally solve this problem,"" he added.

The President said he was also looking forward to ""share more good news in the next few months that reaffirms the optimism which how international investors view the Philippines today.""

""Once again, as part of the Asia-Pacific region, we are still seen as coming back to our role as the driver of the global economy. And the Philippines is very much part of that and we are considered as an investment -- by the Europeans, this is what they told me – that we are considered by the Europeans as number two in terms of investor – the attractiveness next to Vietnam. So we are doing all right but of course, there's room to grow,"" he said."

1076347402,20221215,"The technology involves genetically modifying egg-laying hens so that, when carrying male embryos, those do not progress and hatch - Copyright AFP Danny KEMP

Israeli scientists have created a species of egg-laying hens that only produce females, a breakthrough that could help end the annual culling of around seven billion male chicks globally.

The chicks, born from egg-laying, are destroyed en masse by suffocation or crushing because they are not suitable for meat production and do not lay eggs.

Animal rights activists have denounced the practice as barbaric, and it has been banned in several European states.

A German prohibition on male chick culling came into effect this year. French farmers have until year’s end to comply with new restrictions.

A team at the Israeli Agricultural Research Organization-Volcani Center has used gene editing to develop a new species of hens that only gives birth to females. They say this is the only option to substantially curb mass male chick culling around the world.

“This is a world first and the only solution that is easy for industry players to implement,” team leader Yuval Cinnamon, a Volcani Center embryologist, told AFP.

He said technologies that seek to identify whether an egg is carrying a male or female embryo are not reliable.

The Volcani Center, based in the Tel Aviv suburbs, developed the species following seven years of research in partnership with the American-Israeli firm Huminn, which in part specialises in commercially viable sustainable food production.

The technology involves genetically modifying egg-laying hens so that, when carrying male embryos, those do not progress and hatch.

“After fertilisation the male embryos do not develop, and the female embryos develop normally without being genetically modified and hatch normally,” Cinnamon explained.

“This will provide a real answer to what is probably the most serious animal welfare problem in the world today,” he added.

Beyond the animal rights benefits, the technology could offer poultry producers huge savings in terms of the space and energy required to operate incubators while reducing the significant culling costs.

“It costs a dollar to cull each male chick, so that’s seven billion in savings a year,” Cinnamon said.

Huminn has forecast that commercial benefits from the technology could emerge within two years.

At a meeting in October, European Union agriculture ministers said they would consider a bloc-wide ban on culling male chicks from egg-laying hens, pending the results of an impact assessment."
1076351462,20221215,"Leaders from Vietnam and the International Partners Group, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United States, Italy, Canada, Japan, Norway and Denmark have agreed on a bold Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP).

 

 The Partnership will support Vietnam to deliver on its ambitious Net Zero 2050 goal, accelerate the peaking of its greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy. 

 

 The JETP will mobilise an initial USD15.50 billion of public and private finance over the next three to five years to support Vietnam’s green transition.

 

 The Partnership will support Vietnam in working towards a number of ambitious new targets including bringing forward the projected peaking date for all greenhouse gas emissions in Vietnam from 2035 to 2030; reducing peak annual power sector emissions by up to 30 percent, from 240 megatons to 170 megatons, and bringing forward the peaking date by five years to 2030; limiting Vietnam’s coal capacity to 30.2 gigawatts down from a current planning figure of 37 gigawatts; accelerating the adoption of renewables so that renewable energy accounts for at least 47 percent of electricity generation by 2030, up from the current planned generation share of 36 per cent. 

 

 The successful delivery of these ambitious targets will result in around 500 megatons (0.5 billion tonnes) of emissions saved by 2035.

 

 Initial contributions to the Vietnam JETP include USD7.75 billion in pledges from the IPG together with the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation. This is supported by a commitment to work to mobilise and facilitate a matching USD7.75 billion in private investment from an initial set of private financial institutions coordinated by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).

 

 Over the next 12 months, Vietnam will work with the support of partner countries to develop and adopt the Viet Nam JETP Resource Mobilisation Plan, which will enable the implementation of the JETP funding and strategy.

 

 Vietnam is the third country to launch a JETP, following the successful launch of the South Africa JETP at COP26 and the Indonesia JETP at this year’s G20 Leaders’ summit. As a rapidly growing economy, Vietnam’s JETP will demonstrate that economic growth can be decoupled from fossil fuel energy consumption.

 

 The Vietnam JETP builds on the UK-launched G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), which aims to narrow the infrastructure investment gap in developing countries. G7 leaders agreed in June 2022 to move forward in negotiations with countries on JETPs, which are a core delivery mechanism of the PGII."
1076353511,20221215,"European flags fly in front of the European Parliament in the northeastern French city of Strasbourg on January 16, 2012, on the eve of the first session of the year and the election of the new EU Parliament president to succeed former Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek.

The European Parliament has been shaken by allegations of corruption after the arrests of several of its MEPs on suspicion of accepting bribes from Doha in exchange for defending Qatari interests in Strasbourg, a scandal dubbed ""Qatargate"".

Once hailed as a leader in lobbying transparency whose strict rules are at times ""way ahead of its own member states"", the EU has seen its image tarnished in recent days by allegations of corruption leveled against European Parliament Vice President Eva Kaili along with five MEPs and parliamentary attachés.

A raft of new measures were added to EU transparency rules in 2011 in the wake of a previous cash-for-influence scandal, and lobbying rules were expanded in 2020. Today, the EU has a comprehensive system for registering lobbyists and their activities – although it is not without loopholes.

""The European Parliament is committed to promoting transparency and ethics when it comes to lobbying activities,"" reads its official website. It also states that, ""together with the Council of the European Union and the European Commission, it uses a common transparency register"" to monitor the activities of ""interest representatives"".

Each institution has the option to take additional measures and MEPs are instructed to publish information regarding their communications with lobbyists.

Third countries not required to sign the transparency register

The EU transparency register records the actions of more than 12,000 lobbying groups whose objective is to influence public decisions made at the European level. They may act on behalf of consultancy firms, companies, trade unions, religious organisations or academic institutions. Representatives of local authorities and public bodies may also be involved.

This database also records the interests defended, the legislation and public policies targeted, and the budgets allocated.

Lobbyists must be registered before they can obtain accreditation to the European Parliament, be heard by a parliamentary committee, or meet with European Commissioners, members of their cabinets or directors of the Commission's administration.

As parliamentarians must make note in their online diaries of all formal meetings with lobbyists, the European register, in theory, is aware of all meetings taking place between an elected representative and those representing special interests. This rule applies to committee chairmen, text rapporteurs and parliamentary group aides (only their staff members are exempted).

These transparency rules were put in place in the early 2000s. The European register, on the other hand, emerged in 2011 in the wake of the ""fake lobbyists"" scandal, when three MEPs were tricked by journalists from the British newspaper The Sunday Times into tabling amendments in exchange for bribes of up to €100,000.

Over the years, measures have been put in place to promote transparency, regulate conflicts of interest with MEPs and define relationships with lobbyists, says Cécile Robert, a professor at Sciences Po Lyon specialising in European institutions and politics.

Political scientist Olivier Costa wrote an opinion piece for La Tribune on Tuesday reminding readers that the European system is not without its flaws.

""It is highly irregular that emissaries from third countries (countries outside of the EU defending their interests before the EU parliament) are not required to sign the transparency register, as all other people who plan to visit European institutions must do,"" writes the researcher, arguing for a necessary change in the way the European Parliament operates.

Permanent representations (embassies in Brussels, for example) are exempt from signing the European register, says Costa, a lobbying and regulations expert. Furthermore, other third countries like Qatar – which, just like other organisations representing interests, should technically be included in the transparency register – are also often let off the hook.

These third countries fall under a special category in the register (open access).

""Currently, there are only four entries, so only four lobbies [associated with third countries] are listed, which differs entirely from reality,"" says Robert, adding that Qatar is not on this short list.

Parliamentarians are not allowed to enter into dealings with states that don’t appear on the register. However, when a state representative and parliamentarian ""meet within the context of diplomatic visits"", says Robert, ""no declaration is necessary, because they are not lobbyists as such [according to the European definition]"".

For instance, if the vice-chairwoman of the European Parliament's Human Rights Subcommittee meets with a public figure while on an official visit to a particular country, neither of them is required to sign the transparency register. A third country’s representatives must only register if they have come to Brussels to talk to an MEP in charge of a particular dossier and advocate for their country’s interests in relation to that dossier.

""In this case they are invited to sign the register, but as the register is not compulsory they can also dispense with it. It is up to the member of parliament, however – for whom signing is mandatory – to make the decision not to meet with them,"" says Robert.

So are insufficiently restrictive regulations the problem? Yes, but not only, according to Robert. Other issues, such as ""the way in which the rules governing MEPs’ code of conduct are structured, or the very limited resources allocated to security"", may have encouraged a scandal such as Qatargate.

Accepting money in exchange for a speech or adding an amendment to a European text (or even attempting to do so) has long been prohibited in the European Parliament, says Robert. ""The rule is certainly insufficient in certain respects, but it was put in place after certain acts were committed. On the other hand, if there had been more security and means to check parliamentarians’ appointments, it might have been possible to limit certain interactions.""

Following a scandal of the magnitude of the one currently engulfing the European Parliament, the legislation will have to evolve.

Since 2011, ""progress has been made, but at too slow a pace to circumvent the most unprincipled lobbyists and greediest MEPs"", writes Costa.

On Monday, French Social Democrat MEP Raphaël Glucksmann, chairman of the Special Committee on Foreign Interference in all EU Democratic Processes, called for a committee of enquiry and a high authority tasked with ensuring transparency in public life at the European level, based on France’s HATVP, to be created. The HATVP is an independent French administrative authority responsible for ascertaining and preventing potential conflicts of interest among French public servants.

The “positive side” to these scandals, Robert says, is that they are an opportunity for strengthening the rules. ""This will inevitably lead to more supervision, transparency, and efforts to make these practices compatible with the exercise of democracy,"" she says.

1076359885,20221215,"Due to the impending attack on Ukraine, the Baltic states are supplying Kiev with anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. Germany is examining the delivery of vehicles and night vision devices. Meanwhile, journalists reported that a Russian convoy of nine tanks was on its way to Donetsk.

Ukraine received a shipment of anti-aircraft missiles from Latvia. The Latvian Ministry of Defense announced in Riga, that the Stinger weapons systems have arrived in Kiev and have been delivered to Ukraine. No information was available on the number of missiles delivered. The extradition was decided by the government of the Baltic states of the European Union and NATO in a closed meeting on February 15. This is aimed at strengthening Ukraine’s defense capability. Latvia, along with two other Baltic states, Estonia and Lithuania, announced that it would supply Kiev with US-made weapons systems – with Washington’s approval. Lithuania has also previously sent Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine, and Estonia has delivered Javelin anti-tank missiles.

Latvian President Eagles Levits called on his allies to further strengthen the so-called eastern flank of NATO. “This is a signal to Moscow not to continue its aggression,” Levits said in an interview with NTV. “This is an appropriate response to the aggravation of the situation caused by Russia.” At the same time, he called on the allies to supply weapons to Ukraine so that it could defend itself.

Levits welcomed the decision to suspend the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline for the time being and cautioned that half the measures are not enough. According to Secretary of State Annalina Barbuk, the federal government is considering the delivery of night vision devices and vehicles to Ukraine. This is what the Foreign Minister said at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundestag.

Armament also continues on the Russian side: according to a Reuters correspondent in the early evening, two convoys carrying military goods were moving from the Russian border towards the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Nine tanks are part of the convoy. In a second, trucks and tankers move. Vehicle IDs cannot be set.

Fears are growing of an invasion of Ukraine in the face of a massive build-up of Russian troops on its border. Kremlin President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized the independence of the two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine and announced that Russian soldiers would be sent to the region.

Meanwhile, in Kiev, it was said that Ukraine had once again become the target of a “massive” cyberattack. Deputy Prime Minister Mikhailo Fedorov said in Kiev that government websites and several banks were affected by the attack. For example, the websites of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine could not be opened this afternoon. However, most major news portals in Ukraine worked, as did the websites of most banks and public institutions. Fedorov said the job sites were able to “redirect traffic to another provider to minimize damage”.

Ukraine was already the target of a cyber attack in January. Also at that time, government websites and the online presence of many banks were paralyzed for several hours. Kiev blamed Russia for the attack. Moscow denied the allegations."

The announcement was made during a joint statement by the EU and the three UN agencies in Juba on Wednesday.

Gabriel Octavian Leonte, the Head of Cooperation at the European Union Delegation to South Sudan, said the program targets areas of displacement and return.

“The program is focusing on education, livelihoods, and community cohesion and targets in particular areas of displacement and return,” he said. “You all know that South Sudanese people despite their resilience and strength, have gone through a long period of hardships, and conflict and that caused a lot of trouble for many people and many communities.”

“We do hope that this program will provide a response to these challenges that they are facing and will empower them, be them, women, men or boys, and girls to build up resilience, to build more sustainable future for themselves,” he added.

Meanwhile, Kristina Uzelac, the Acting Head of Operations of IOM in South Sudan, said the project aims to support over 120,000 beneficiaries in three years.

“As all the three agencies are well positioned in different platforms, this will have a catalytic impact on us building synergies with other partners to move this work in South Sudan,” she stated.

On his part, Jesper Moller, the Deputy Representative of UNICEF in South Sudan, said appreciated the efforts and the emphasis of the EU delegation in South Sudan on bringing education to the citizens of the country.

“It is important to note that access to education is indeed and must be considered as a cornerstone in terms of what the future can bring for South Sudanese,” he said. “And noting the fact that at the moment we have more than 2.8 million children that are out of school in South Sudan and so the emphasis and the strategic importance of investing in children from the point of view of the European Union is very much appreciated.”

WFP’s Deputy Country Director in South Sudan, Harald Mannhardt, said the project is a great example of how entities can work together.

“We can scale up our synergies and work together going forward and improve the educational outcomes through these combined projects and through adding to the assets within the community,” he said."

A Ukrainian general said on Thursday that Moscow was digging in for a long war and still wanted to conquer the whole of Ukraine, as Russian forces pounded two strategic cities while Kyiv’s troops shelled Russian-controlled Donetsk in the east.

Both sides have ruled out a Christmas truce and there are currently no talks aimed at ending the nearly 10-month-old conflict, Europe’s largest since World War Two.

Russian shelling killed two people in the centre of Kherson, the southern city liberated by Ukraine last month, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office. The shelling also knocked out the city’s electricity, officials said.

Russian forces also attacked critical infrastructure in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, causing several explosions, its mayor, Ihor Terekhov, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

“The Kremlin… is seeking to turn the conflict into a prolonged armed confrontation,” a senior Ukrainian officer, Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov, told a news briefing.

Also read: Afghan Taliban administration, Myanmar junta not allowed into United Nations for now

“The main strategic objective of the enemy remains seizing all the territory of our country (and) not allowing Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration,” said Gromov, who also dismissed the possibility of a truce over the festive period.

On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said a Christmas ceasefire was “not on the agenda”.

Earlier on Thursday, Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-installed mayor of Donetsk, said Ukraine had fired 40 rockets from BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers at the city, in what he said was the heaviest attack there since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists wrested it from Kyiv’s control.

There were no reports of deaths in Donetsk, though Kulemzin said five people had been hurt, including a child.

Reuters footage showed firefighters dousing smoking embers in a Donetsk apartment building struck by a missile and also a woman clearing shattered glass in a hospital ward also hit.

Ukraine’s military General Staff said Moscow’s main focus remained on the eastern cities of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, but that it was also shelling Kherson daily and trying to get a stronger foothold in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia.

“The Russians fired at different areas along the entire front line all night and in the morning,” the Ukrainian governor of Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Telegram, adding there had been two air strikes on Avdiivka.

One person was killed and four injured near Bakhmut, he said.

Reuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield accounts from either side.

“(The Russians) are crawling like zombies on our positions in Bakhmut, creating pressure in the south of the Donetsk region,” Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential office, wrote on Telegram.

“They understand that if they do not stretch the front now, then this winter will be a disaster for them.”

In a move that would significantly bolster Kyiv’s air defence, U.S. officials told Reuters a decision on providing the Patriot missile system to the Ukrainian military could be announced as soon as Thursday.

The Kremlin said the United States was getting “deeper and deeper into the conflict in the post-Soviet republic”, and that U.S. Patriot systems would be legitimate targets, something that Russia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday applied to all weapons supplied to Ukraine by the West.

Asked about the possibility of Ukraine getting the U.S. Patriot systems, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “It hasn’t been confirmed yet but it will show quite how concerned people are by Russia’s deliberate targeting of civilian, critical national infrastructure.”

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a speech to the Rights Council following a visit to Ukraine that Russia’s strikes were exposing millions to “extreme hardship”.

On Wednesday, Kyiv suffered the first major drone attack in weeks. Two administrative buildings were hit, but air defences largely repelled the attack. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 13 drones had been shot down.

Tens of thousands of people have been killed, millions more displaced and cities reduced to rubble since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in a “special military operation”, saying it needed to protect Russian speakers from Ukrainian nationalists. Kyiv and its allies call it an unprovoked war of aggression.

“We and the world should not relax, because the ultimate goal of the Russian Federation is to conquer all of Ukraine, and then it can move on,” said Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar, speaking at the same Kyiv briefing as Gromov.

Russia has fired barrages of missiles on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure since October, disrupting power supplies and leaving people without heating in freezing winter conditions.

National grid operator Ukrenergo said on Thursday Ukraine continued to suffer a “significant” deficit of electricity due to the strikes, including new ones in the east, adding that the situation was exacerbated by the wintry weather.

A senior U.N. official expressed optimism that there would be a breakthrough in negotiations to ease exports of Russian fertilisers to avoid global food shortages next year.

Russia has complained its concerns about fertiliser exports had not been addressed when a deal for extending a Black Sea grain export agreement was agreed in November.

European Union member states tried again on Thursday to agree on a ninth package of Russia sanctions after Poland and Lithuania blocked a deal late on Wednesday over concerns it might benefit Russian oligarchs in the fertiliser business.

Further financial and military aid to Ukraine will feature prominently on the agenda of EU leaders meeting in Brussels for a summit later on Thursday."
1076381093,20221215,"Russia expressed concern on Thursday over escalating tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan as a key road linking Armenia to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave remained blocked for the fourth day.The two countries have fought repeated wars over Nagorno-Karabakh - internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but home to about 120,000 ethnic Armenians - since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. As recently as September, more than 200 soldiers were killed in a flare-up of fighting.A group of Azerbaijanis claiming to be environmental activists blocked the Lachin corridor, the only land route for people, goods, food and medical supplies to reach Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia across Azerbaijani territory, at the start of this week.Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Thursday that the closure of the passage was a ""gross violation"" of a 2020 peace agreement between Baku and Yerevan and that the population of the enclave had been made into hostages.Armenia says the protesters have been dispatched by the Azerbaijani government in an attempt to block Armenia's access to the region. Baku rejects those claims, saying the dispute is over illegal Armenian mining in Nagorno-Karabakh.The standoff is a test of Russia's authority as the main security guarantor in the region at a time when its struggles in the war in Ukraine risk undermining its top-dog status among former Soviet republics in the South Caucasus and Central Asia.The Azerbaijani protesters have managed to blockade the road despite the presence of Russian peacekeepers from a 5,000-strong force that Moscow sent in late 2020.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed Moscow's concern over the situation and said it expected the route to be cleared soon.""Russia's defence ministry and the Russian peacekeeping contingent have been actively working to de-escalate the situation and we expect full transport links to be restored in the very near future,"" Zakharova told reporters.Russia is an ally of Armenia through a mutual self-defence pact, but tries to maintain warm relations with Azerbaijan and has rejected calls by Yerevan to provide military support.The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday that the closure of the Lachin corridor ""has severe humanitarian implications and sets back the peace process"", and called on Azerbaijan to restore free movement.The European Union also expressed ""serious concern"" over the deteriorating situation, urging Azerbaijan to restore free and secure passage.(Reporting by Jake Cordell; Editing by Mark Trevelyan and Hugh Lawson)"
1076381094,20221215,"A POST-BREXIT deal on Gibraltar appeared to take a step closer to becoming a reality this week, after a hastily arranged meeting in Madrid on Wednesday between Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares and his opposite number in the UK James Cleverly.

‘We are closer [to a deal] now than at the beginning of the meeting,’ the Spanish minister said in comments reported by Politico. The talks, he added, are ‘advancing at a good pace’.

For his part, Cleverly said that the UK government was ‘fully invested in agreeing a deal as soon as possible’.

Gibraltar’s Chief Minister Fabian Picardo was also present at the meeting, via video link

A provisional agreement on Gibraltar was struck on New Year’s Eve 2020, leaving day-to-day life in the British Overseas Territory unchanged. Since then, there have been nearly a dozen rounds of talks on its future over the past year. The negotiations have been hindered by the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the unstable political landscape in the UK this year.

According to Albares, the proposal that the UK has in its hands, and which has been approved by the European Commission and Spain, includes doing away with the land border between Spain and Gibraltar, the free movement of people and goods, equal pensions for Spaniards who have worked in the territory and UK nationals, and tougher environmental restrictions.

The Spanish minister warned on Wednesday that ‘we can’t be negotiating eternally’, adding that ‘nothing is agreed until everything is agreed’.

Cleverly, meanwhile, said that talks were progressing in an ‘optimistic and positive spirit’, and that just ‘modest differences remain’.

He made clear, however, that ‘if the proposal was completely acceptable’ for the UK, ‘we would have accepted it’.

One of the reported sticking points is the issue of who will carry out customs checks at the airport and port should Gibraltar become part of the Schengen free-movement area.

The UK wants it to be officials from Frontex, the European Union’s border force, while Spain insists it should be their officers, albeit with the concession that Frontex would assist over the first four years.

‘It is clear that, if there is an extension of the Schengen area, then the controls have to be carried out on behalf of the European Union by the approved authorities, which in this case is the Spanish police,’ said Albares in comments reported by the Financial Times.

One of Spain’s objectives for the post-Brexit deal is for the neighbouring Spanish comarca (county) of Campo de Gibraltar, one of the poorest in the country, to benefit from its proximity to the British Overseas Territory. Some 15,000 workers cross from Spain into Gibraltar every day.

One point that has not been up for discussion is the sovereignty of Gibraltar, which was ceded to the British in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht. The UK is not moving from its position that the territory must remain British, while Madrid refuses to recognise its sovereignty.

1076381098,20221215,"The EU is being rocked by a scandal at the heart of its European institutions. As Russia's war in Ukraine is showing no signs of slowing, critical decisions need to be made for European citizens.

Amongst all this, concrete resolutions to Europe's energy crisis remain elusive to EU leaders.

In an exclusive interview, Euronews spoke to Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Brussels on Wednesday. We began by asking for his thoughts on the so-called Qatargate scandal, with the alleged bribery of EU officials, including a European Parliament vice president.

""I was quite shocked"", Morawiecki revealed. ""I hope that the rule of law is going to be back to the European Parliament and all those scandalous behaviours are going to be explained.""

While political drama unfolds in Brussels, EU ministers again failed to make headway in discussions over dealing with the bloc's energy crisis, despite months of talks. The Polish PM told Euronews that he doesn't expect to see a breakthrough any time soon.

""I see that some countries which have to deal with this crisis -- from the point of view of the prices of gas, prices of oil -- do this in a very, very selfish way"", Mateusz Morawiecki said. ""They do not see [the] bigger picture. They do not see the impact of the natural resources and the prices on Ukraine in direct impact, because fuelling the Russian war machines should stop as quickly as possible.""

""Poland was always one of those countries, one of those very few countries, which were the most radical in terms of increasing big sanction packages very quickly, because we were of the view that the sooner we are going to really address the Russian war machine, the sooner the peace and good peace is going to be back in Europe.""

Despite countless discussions about a gas price cap in Europe, citizens continue to see their energy bills skyrocket as EU leaders fail to find a solution.

""Several countries, including Poland, some months ago, [in] April, May and June, we pushed the European Commission and some other northern countries in particular, together with Italy and Spain. We were trying to action aid"", Poland's Prime Minister explained to Euronews.

""We are trying to stimulate [an] appropriate common denominator... because we knew that the cap on gas [prices] should be found somewhere in the middle of our expectations and some expectations of Germany and the Netherlands and the others. However, the way they stubbornly blocked this is, to me, quite worrisome because I believe that we are still far from finding a compromise on a gas price cap.""

When asked if Germany and the Netherlands were to blame for this deadlock, Morawiecki insisted that ""I'm not blaming anybody, but I'm just signalling that solidarity for the whole of Europe means to work out, as quickly as possible, a common denominator and not always the lowest common denominator.""

As negotiations reach a deadlock, concerns are being raised that the continent's energy security may be at risk this winter, and for many winters to come. According to Poland's Prime Minister, people are right to be concerned.

""The European Union is...an economic powerhouse. We can push our partners -- and I don't mean Russia by this, I mean other countries -- to have mid-term or long-term agreements on gas set on an appropriate level and [which are] not dependent on such huge fluctuations and speculation which happened in August of this year and in September.""

As the war in Ukraine continues, French president Emmanuel Macron said that the West should consider giving security guarantees to Russia to end the war. But Mateusz Morawiecki told Euronews that Moscow doesn't need such guarantees.

""I think that Russia, being a superpower, [being] weakened but still having a nuclear weapon and a strong army really does not require any type of guarantees because they have the guarantees in their own hands.""

""The only country which needs support and guarantees for their sovereignty and security is Ukraine here. So this is why I think that our appropriate approach would be to support Ukraine through stronger weapon delivery and financial aid so that Putin and the Kremlin see that we are serious in supporting Ukraine not only throughout this winter but in the years to come.""

The rule of law: is the shoe on the other foot?

The European Union decided to freeze EU funds for Hungary over concerns that this money may aid corruption. When asked for his thoughts about this decision, Morawiecki revealed that he believes Hungary is being unfairly treated.

""I can tell you that I'm astonished and shocked with the corruption in the European Parliament. That's the first thing"", he said. ""I think that the procedures in the European Parliament and in the other institutions should be reviewed, big time.""

""As far as the approach of the European Union to Hungary is concerned, I think that given that Hungary has quite a conservative government, this is one of the reasons why Hungary's attacked [so much]. I'm not an expert on the Hungarian ecosystem [but] I think that a significant part, if not all of the attacks are unjustified.""

Concerns were also raised about Poland, but no such decision was made, leading many to decry what they see as double standards for Poland and Hungary.

""I can only emphasise that both Hungary and Poland are treated in a very unjust way, it shouldn't have been the case.""

""We are targeted by the European Commission all the time for the last couple of years because they do not agree in repairing, or in reforming post-communist judiciary [systems].""

When asked if he felt that Brussels had softened its attitude towards Poland since the war broke out in Ukraine, Mateusz Morawiecki strongly disagreed.

""Softened? I don't see this at all. I see that they are still very brutally intervening beyond their competencies, which are not included in the treaties. And we are quite loud about this. So this is why I'm so surprised with their approach [over the] last [few] years."""
1076384725,20221215,"Moldova and Ukraine are officially candidates to join the European Union, while Georgia is not. They say that it does not meet the requirements. So 120,000 Georgians protest that the goals will be achieved quickly and put enormous pressure on their government.

In the Georgian capital Tbilisi, about 120,000 people took to the streets in support of joining the European Union and against their government. The protesters waved Georgian and European Union flags and called for Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili to resign – a day after the European Union refused to award him the title of candidate country.

“We, the people of Georgia, demand the resignation of Irakli Garibashvili and the formation of a new government that will implement all the reforms demanded by the European Union,” said one of the organizers of the rally. “We are giving the government a week to meet the demands,” he said, as the demonstrators chanted, “Resign.”

Organizers announced another mass rally on July 3, which will end only “after the rule of the oligarchy is eliminated” – a reference to former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili. Ivanishvili is the richest man in Georgia and is considered a strongman behind the scenes in the ruling party, although officially he no longer plays a political role.

“We are free people, free countries and we will always be free. Ukraine will help Georgia find its way to Europe,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, addressing the crowd in a video message during the protests. He said that Ukraine and Georgia stand together forever to the applause of the masses.

At a summit meeting in Brussels on Thursday, the European Union announced that Ukraine and Moldova are candidates to join the European Union – but not Georgia. The President of the Council of the European Union, Charles Michel, has announced that the European Union is also ready in principle to grant Georgia candidate status. However, a number of reforms have yet to be implemented in the country for this to happen.

Garibashvili said his government wanted to meet the EU’s requirements in time “so that we can obtain candidate status as quickly as possible”."
1076382931,20221215,"In the fight against the climate crisis, there are many commitments, but little progress. The United Nations and the United States now want to speed up the process with a new summit. Above all, methane emissions of the greenhouse gas must be reduced.

Before the general election, everyone in this country is talking about climate protection – but little is happening internationally at the moment. This week, Climate Action Tracker CAT calculated that there have been no new commitments from states on specific 2030 climate protection targets for several months.

After the clear statements by the European Union and the United States of America in April, calm reigned: 70 countries – more than a third of the signatories to the Paris Agreement – did nothing to do. Dozens of other countries – including Switzerland and New Zealand – have made weaker commitments than before. The world is far from the common goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.

US President Joe Biden and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres now want to give new impetus to the issue through high-level meetings behind closed doors. At the “main emissions forum,” Biden still wanted to focus primarily on the greenhouse gas methane.

The United States of America and the European Union have reached a “global methane pledge”, to which as many as possible should agree. The key is a commitment to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas. Because of its relatively short duration of activity in the atmosphere, reducing it quickly achieves climate protection success.

Germany is represented by the Parliamentary Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Rita Schwarzleuhr-Sutter. However, it remains unclear whether Germany can join the group of supporters. It does not have as many methane emissions as others. They are mainly caused by leaks in oil and gas production. There is easy fighting.

In our country, methane is produced mainly in agriculture by raising livestock. The Climate Protection Act only mandates a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by less than 20 percent for agriculture by 2030. So the “Global Methane Pledge” would represent a significant tightening.

It is unclear what other countries will be represented and whether, for example, China’s head of state and government Xi Jinping will participate. He was present at Biden’s first ever meeting in April. However, perhaps the US president learned a lesson from this event, which was public at the time, that this is only a way to capture store window letters. Because he wants to achieve something substantial this time, the doors remain closed. It is also unclear whether there will be a review of the meeting after that, or whether it will be left to states to publish their position themselves sooner or later.

Biden also wants to pressure struggling nations to meet their 2030 climate commitments ahead of the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. Monday’s meeting aims in the same direction. To this end, United Nations Secretary-General Guterres and British Prime Minister Johnson have invited to host the climate summit in Glasgow. This meeting will also be held in secret session on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Chancellor Merkel – like the others – will be physically connected here.

Guterres blames mistrust for the lack of progress in international climate negotiations, and has previously said the aim of these talks is to build trust. Some emerging countries will have to do more, but on the other hand, industrialized countries will eventually have to meet their financial obligations. They have pledged to mobilize $100 billion annually to help poor countries move toward a clean energy future. But so far, only 80 billion euros have been raised.

Germany’s Minister of State for the Environment, Jochen Flasbarth, is supposed to help here with Canada’s Environment Minister. They should close the gap by the Glasgow Climate Summit. The elected president of this conference, Alok Sharma, entrusted them with this. The Guterres event is supposed to help. There is also a public event where Chancellor Merkel will broadcast a video message.

The Climate Conference will take place in Glasgow in the first two weeks of November. “With the current situation, we risk failure there,” Guterres warned this week."
1076382932,20221215,"Two main components comprise the foreign policy and military world: policy and operations. Policy officers determine the objectives; operations officers get the job done. Both cooperate to accomplish their goals.

In the Catholic Church, Jesus is the highest-ranking policy officer, with the Apostles and their successors as high-ranking operations officers. Concerning Church matters, priests and bishops are operations personnel in the field. A priest who pretends he is a policy officer plays a dangerous game.

But every voter in the US by right — including a priest —is a policy analyst. The Ukraine conflict provides a setting for every armchair analyst. Here is my commentary.

After the collapse of the Soviet empire, a saying arose: Russian rulers determine their oligarchs; Ukraine oligarchs determine their rulers. The phrase sounds about right based on reports coming from that part of the world. Ukraine has become one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Who knows? Ukraine oligarchs may have determined the behavior of our rulers. Time will tell.

The toxic politics of America and the incompetency and malice of the mainstream media have ruined our trust. We don’t know the facts because they don’t provide them or lie.

The lies are numerous and numbing: the Russia hoax, mendacious COVID narratives, the “mostly peaceful” Black Lives Matter riots, the refusal on Woke grounds to cover the Waukesha slaughter, the January 6 “insurrection,” the border security fraud, transgender advocacy that disguises the horror of genital mutilation, the Biden and Pelosi claim of devout Catholic status, and so on.

Adding insult to injury, U.S. military policymakers have now gone woke. According to a Heritage Foundation report, “Wokeness in the military is being imposed by elected and appointed leaders in the White House, Congress, and the Pentagon who have little understanding of the purpose, character, traditions, and requirements of the institution they are trying to change.”

Institutionalized lies provide the context for another futile war -- supported by Hollywood clichés, the Washington establishment, and a mendacious media. With policies set in secret by elites, most political, religious, and media establishments are dutifully executing operations supporting objectives they struggle to articulate.

On the eve of the Russian attack on eastern Ukraine, my American citizen policy view was simple: Ukraine, Russia, and the upcoming war are none of our business. The European Union has more interest in the stability of Europe than Americans. The US doesn’t need another proxy war. Beginning with Korea, the US has a track record of horribly destructive operational half-measures with questionable constitutional authority supporting ill-defined objectives that usually end badly.

Recognizing the widespread corruption in Russia and Ukraine, I have wondered how ordinary Ukrainians would fare under Russian occupation. How would life change if Russian oligarchs replaced Ukrainian oligarchs? Probably not much. But that’s none of our business, either.

I hoped negotiations would prevent the meat grinder of war. I especially hoped my country would not participate in the sausage-making. American policy incompetence in Afghanistan was fresh in my memory. Over twenty years of occupation (with rainbow flags hanging from the US embassy) and President Biden’s feckless withdrawal from Afghanistan is becoming the policy standard.

An early negotiated settlement between the warring parties in Ukraine was within reach not long ago. Perhaps all would agree to the neutrality of Ukraine and cede some of the Russian-speaking portions of Ukraine back to Russia. Hope evaporated. Instead, the US intervened and provided billions in wartime assistance to Ukraine with no end in sight. The European Union (roughly comparable to the US economy) has contributed much less to the war effort. First and foremost, it is their collective responsibility. Washington has failed to demonstrate why US interests are more significant than European interests.

The US is stuck with pesky unarticulated policy questions. What are the American strategic objectives? What are our national interests justifying the proxy war with Russia? Do our policy objectives justify the risk of WWIII? If not, how do those policy measures explain the half-measures of military support? How does the slaughter of ordinary Ukrainians (the working men, not the oligarchs and rulers) justify the American extension of the war? There are moral imperatives here in the formation of our nation’s policies.

As the harsh Ukrainian winter descends, depending upon the lies we choose to believe, upwards of 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers may have died in the war, with a similar number of Russians. The media repeatedly report that Russians are losing, and the Ukrainian counteroffensive was wildly successful in recapturing contested territory. But now the Russians are taking out the energy grids of Ukraine, about to place the whole country into a deadly deep freeze, and massing troops. The Russians aim to win big, possibly with widespread death and destruction.

Ironically, many Russians are reportedly upset with their leadership for pursuing only half-measures instead of winning the war. It is reminiscent of Vietnam, where half-measures on the part of American policy led to much death and suffering without a positive outcome.

In part, negotiations are in deep freeze because meddling Americans have kept the Zelensky government on financial life support, with a thriving illegal arms trade. As Ukraine freezes, reports indicate that most Ukrainian oligarchs rest comfortably in elegant European hot spots.

The US hasn’t officially sent in troops (a secret contingent of Special Forces personnel counts only in terms of body bags). We won’t raise the rainbow flag of victory and probably won’t receive Russian POWs. Look at the bright side. The reluctance to send troops saves our guys from the ignominy of using a POW intake form that asks: What is your gender assigned at birth? What are your preferred pronouns?

Political elites in both parties and the experts and Hollywood stands proudly in a virtue-signaling posture with Zelensky and his oligarchs. Let’s stand, instead, with ordinary Ukrainians and not the inexplicable American proxy war.

Jesus offers good policy advice: “What king, going to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?” (Lk. 14:31)"

The NLD won 83 percent of the vote in the November election, and the country’s election commission has denied the allegations. The military has declared a state of emergency for a year, after which elections will be held.

Army chief Miang Aung-hliang will now head the government, according to the military-controlled Miyawati TV. The military said it had seized control in response to “election fraud”.

It then removed 24 ministers and named 11 alternatives to oversee the ministries, including finance, defense, foreign affairs and home affairs, Reuters reported. NBC News could not immediately confirm the report.

The announcement on military-owned television cited the country’s constitution, which allows for military takeovers in times of emergency. The announcer said the corona virus crisis and the government’s failure to postpone the November elections were reasons for the emergency.

The military drafted the constitution in 2008 and retains power under the constitution at the expense of democratic, civilian rule. The New York-based International Campaigner Human Rights Watch described the rule as a “waiting coup mechanism”.

The acquisition was quickly condemned outside the country. The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia and Singapore have all called for Suu Kyi’s release.

“America stands with the people of Burma in the aspirations for democracy, freedom, peace and development.” Secretary of State Anthony Blingen said, Used the country’s name until it was replaced by the ruling military junta in 1989.

1076393053,20221215,"BRUSSELS -- The European Union said Thursday it approved a new package of sanctions aimed at ramping up pressure on Russia for its war in Ukraine.

The package, whose details had not been revealed, was approved after days of deliberations during a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's ambassadors in Brussels while EU leaders held a summit nearby.

The Czech Republic, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, said the package would be confirmed by written procedure Friday. No last-minute issues were expected before details would be published in the bloc's legal records.

“These sanctions, we know they are efficient,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said, adding that the punitive measures should be complemented with financial, military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. “They are gradually making an impact, including on Russia's capacity to produce and regenerate its weapons.""

The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, last week proposed travel bans and asset freezes on almost 200 more Russian officials and military officers as part of the new round of measures.

It was unclear whether the proposals had been changed during negotiations among member countries.

The targets of the latest recommended sanctions included government ministers, lawmakers, regional governors and political parties. The EU Commission also wanted to hit the Russian defense industry and more Russian banks and to impose export controls and restrictions on products like chemicals, nerve agents, electronics and IT components that could be used by the armed forces.

EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen also proposed “to ban the direct exports of drone engines to Russia and the export to any third countries, such as Iran, which could supply drones to Russia.”

In addition, the European Commission recommended that EU members take action against Russia’s energy and mining sectors, including with a ban on new mining investments, and that they move to take more Russian TV stations off the air in Europe.

“We are further raising pressure on the Russian leadership,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.

In addition to sanctions on various entities, banks and individuals, including Putin and members of his family, the EU previously approved an embargo on coal and seaborne oil imports in close concert with Western allies.

1076394903,20221215,"Georgia's imprisoned former president, Mikheil Saakashvili, is likely to stay in detention in the former Soviet republic after his legal bid for medical treatment abroad was delayed on Wednesday.

After Saakashvili called off a hunger strike earlier in the week, his lawyer said Thursday that the former president would eat only food sent to him by his family because he no longer trusted the prison’s food. Saakashvili and his medical team alleged last month that he was being slowly poisoned with heavy metals.

Saakashvili, a pro-Western leader of the ex-Soviet republic between 2004 and 2013, is serving a six-year sentence for abuse of power, a charge that he and his supporters deny and call politically motivated.

On Wednesday, a Tbilisi court heard some opening arguments from prosecutors before adjourning until December 22, the second weeklong delay of the proceedings. Saakashvili, who is being treated in a Tbilisi clinic, accused the government of denying him the right to trial, but Georgia’s Justice Ministry said that the hospital was simply not equipped for videoconferencing.

""The aim is to kill Mikheil Saakashvili,” the ex-president’s lawyer, Shalva Khachapuridze, told reporters in Tbilisi on Wednesday. The government has denied that Saakashvili’s life is in danger.

Saakashvili had not been seen for months until Wednesday, when the government released video surveillance from his hospital room in an attempt to prove that he was healthier than his team has claimed.

“The aim is to prove that no one is tortured in Georgia,” Justice Minister Rati Bregadze said.

The video footage is dated from August, October and December this year. The most recent video shows the ex-president using a walker.

Saakashvili’s lawyer said that the government published footage of Saakashvili without his consent and that he would file a complaint against the justice minister and the prison system.

The charges against Saakashvili, as well as his treatment in detention, have prompted concerns among human rights watchdogs and foreign diplomats that the Georgian government's pursuit of justice risks being seen as political retribution and a source of national division.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson told VOA that department officials were closely monitoring the situation.

“Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the Georgian government to ensure Mr. Saakashvili’s health is protected and human rights are respected,” the spokesperson said. “We will continue to advocate for the authorities to take appropriate steps to ensure his health and welfare, based on the recommendations of the public defender’s medical experts.”

 

 On Wednesday, the European Union parliament voted for a resolution asking Georgia’s president, Salome Zurabishvili, to use her constitutional right to release Saakashvili. The resolution also emphasized the Georgian government’s responsibility for the health and life of the former president.

A medical report distributed on November 29 by Saakashvili’s legal team stated that he had been ""poisoned"" by heavy metals and that his life could be in danger without proper treatment. Saakashvili's doctors say that his health has worsened significantly since he went to prison in October 2021 and staged repeated hunger strikes.

“He's [Saakashvili] very near death now because the toxins are continuing to eat on his body; he needs to be transferred to a facility that understands detoxification,” Dr. David Smith, the author of the report, told VOA’s Georgian Service.

Smith could not elaborate on how exactly these toxins appeared in the former president’s body, but he believes this was not done on purpose by the doctors.

“This is speculative, but I think what happened is they didn't recognize the heavy metal poisoning and they prescribed a whole series of drugs, some of which were counteractive,"" he said. ""They didn't know what was happening. Heavy metal poisoning is a difficult diagnosis.”

In a statement to VOA, Georgia’s justice ministry said that they suggested Saakashvili take another toxicology test following the report from his medical team. The results have not been released."

The final text has not yet been released as it first needs to be sent and formally endorsed by all EU capitals but is expected to be made public on Friday.

The European Commission's proposal, released last week, planned for a further 200 Russian individuals and entities to be hit with asset freezes and travel bans. These include government ministers, lawmakers, regional governors, political parties and entities including the armed forces.

They will join the 1,241 individuals and 118 entities already blacklisted.

It also targeted the Russian defence industry, more Russian banks, and the mining sectors and planned for export controls on products such as chemicals, nerve agents, electronics, and IT components that could be used by the armed forces, as well as components for unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones.

The package was held up for days over a disagreement by some EU nations over whether to include derogations to allow for payments to sanctioned Russian oligarchs at the head of companies exporting agricultural and food products.

The bloc has not imposed any sanctions on Russian food and agricultural products so as to not exacerbate a worrisome global food crisis. But the measures on the oligarchs prevent EU operators from participating directly or indirectly in commercial flows involving entities they own.

The final text of the new package is expected to include a legal clause, already existing for sectoral sanctions, to the listings of individuals and entities. This clause is to provide legal certainty to EU operators that they can engage with large food and agriculture companies owned by sanctioned oligarchs provided they were already exporting before Russia launched its invasion, an EU diplomat told Euronews.

This is to prevent attempts to circumvent sanctions through the creation of new businesses.

Leaders meanwhile approved an €18 billion macro-financial assistance package for Ukraine for 2023 to ensure Kyiv can cover state deficits and keep the economy running as it continues to fight the Russian invasion.

To fund the aid and loan it to Kyiv at a highly concessional rate the EU will raise common debt, a proposal that initially met resistance from Hungary.

But Budapest lifted its veto earlier this week after EU nations agreed to allow the sum of the EU funds it has frozen under the new rule of law mechanism from €7.5 billion to €6.3 billion.

A Polish veto over the introduction of a minimum global corporate tax also threatened the adoption of the assistance package on Thursday but Warsaw, a staunch supporter of Ukraine, eventually lifted its objection.

A virtual address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he described the package as ""vital"", is believed to have helped move the needle.

Zelenskyy urged European Council President Charles Michel ""to ensure that our struggle for peace for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe does not depend on misunderstandings and controversies between some EU member states.""

""The packages of macro-financial support for Ukraine are also weapons in defence of freedom. Just as the ninth package of EU sanctions against Russia. This is our protection. Please understand that! I hope that already in January we will be able to thank you for the first tranche of this macro-financial package,"" he added."

AMMAN — The 13th edition of Karama Human Rights Film Festival kicked off on Thursday at the Royal Cultural Centre (RCC) in Amman under the theme of “Transformation, Deviation, Mutation”.

This year’s edition “examines shifting post-pandemic social, economic and political realities that are marking the beginning of a new era, yet to be discovered”, according to a statement by Karama made available to The Jordan Times.

In her opening remarks, Festival Director Sawsan Darwaza said that the “radical” transformation witnessed by the world following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has lead people “to lose focus on what really matters”.

“This year’s theme intends to spark and encourage an honest observation of our collective and individual standpoints, in the hope that an informed and conscious choice of direction will emerge,” she said.

“Only by knowing where we stand, will we know where we are going,” Darwaza added.

Artistic Director Ehab Al Khatib said that the festival dedicated its “Empty Chair” recognition for the French director Jean-Luc Godard, who died last September at the age of 91, for his role in revolutionising cinema and as a “reminder of the necessity of change” in the film industry.

The festival also celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which marked the United Nation’s launch of a year-long campaign under the theme: “HYPERLINK ""https://www.ohchr.org/en/get-involved/campaign/human-rights-day/udhr-75""Dignity, Freedom and Justice for All”.

During the opening, Head of Cooperation at the European Union Delegation to Jordan Patrick Lambrechts commended the festival’s role in bringing to light “human stories that matter”.

He also noted that cinema is a “powerful tool in bringing human rights to life”.

“It has the ability to influence, persuade, bring down walls and borders” between people and “inspire [them] to act and to drive change”, Lambrechts said.

The opening also featured the screening of Our Music, a 2004 film directed by Godard which touches on colonialism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The short animated film ZOO by Jordanian director Tariq Rimawi, which sheds light on the repercussions of war, was also displayed, followed by a performance by renowned Lebanese musician Ahmad Kaabour.

Additionally, Karama’s annual “Conscience of Art” exhibition opened its doors at the RCC.

The upcoming days will feature a number of musical performances, interactive group discussions and a symposium on “Climate Change and Societal Turbulence”. Karama’s community outreach programme also involves external film screenings in local schools and universities as well as refugee communities, according to organisers.

Caoimhe Butterly, an Irish human rights activist, film-maker and psychotherapist spoke with The Jordan Times about her film Tadhg, meaning “storyteller”, which will be screened on Saturday and Sunday at the RCC.

Butterly has worked with refugee and undocumented communities for over 20 years in Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Mexico, Haiti and Guatemala.

She co-authored and co-directed this film with her 10-year-old child Tadhg.

The film is a child’s reflection on life, friendship, the forests, the sea and the rights that are denied to refugees, according to Butterly.

She noted that Tadhg follows the journeys of two refugee teenagers from Darfur, Sudan and Syria who cross sea and land in search of “a safe and dignified human life”.

“It steps away from the failings of governments and political systems, bringing to light the purity of a child’s perspective that is able to instinctively distinguish justice from injustice and empathy from cruelty,” Butterly added.

The festival, which runs through December 21, will screen 65 films from 50 countries at the RCC.

It is co-sponsored by the EU and organised by MA3MAL612-Think Factory, a non-governmental organisation that aims to function as an incubator for artists and creative thinkers."
