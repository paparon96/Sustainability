1066709096,20221009,"The world's richest man has just had a very turbulent week, marked by a strong repudiation of his peace plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, which has been going on since Feb. 24, when Moscow invaded Kyiv.

The CEO of Tesla (TSLA) proposed to the Ukrainians to recognize as Russian territories regions of their country - Crimea and the Donbas - occupied by force by Russia.

He also asked them to no longer seek to become a member of NATO and the European Union.

These proposals have landed him harsh criticism from the Ukrainian authorities and almost most of the opinion in Western countries, who believe that Russia and its President Vladimir Putin are the aggressors and must therefore withdraw from Ukraine.

The tech tycoon also capitulated in his battle against Twitter (TWTR) . He put back on the table his offer to acquire the platform for $44 billion, three months after withdrawing it on the pretext that he had been lied to about the number of fake accounts existing on the social network.

The two parties are currently working to finalize the deal by Oct. 28, a deadline set by the Delaware Chancery Court, if Musk is to avoid a trial that was scheduled to begin on Oct. 17.

This saga, which began on April 4, has already had many twists and turns. It seems that this time it is on the right path. Musk is expected to soon become the owner of Twitter, which he promised to take private.

The mogul wants to use the social network to create a new platform which he called ""X, the everything app.""

This super app will compete with the giants of Silicon Valley, in particular with Meta Platforms (META) , parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, the media empire built by Mark Zuckerberg.

Musk does not like Zuckerberg and does not hide it. He dubbed him ""Zuck the Fourteenth"" -- an apparent reference to the French king, famous for his hubris and excess, Louis XIV.

He has just won an important and unexpected victory over this nemesis. Rapper and trendsetter Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has just become active on Twitter again, hours after his Instagram account was restricted for violations of the platform's policy.

""Look at this Mark,"" Ye posted on Twitter on Oct. 8, referring to Zuckerberg. ""How you gone kick me off instagram.""

""You used to be my nigga,"" Ye added, with a photo of him and Zuckerberg in what looks like a music studio.

Musk did not hesitate to respond to this message by welcoming Ye with open arms.

""Welcome back to Twitter, my friend!"" the billionaire commented.

Basically, Musk embraces the adage: enemies of my enemies are my friends. Ye's tweet is one of his two tweets posted on Oct. 8. This is the first time the rapper, who is also a businessman and trendsetter, has been active on Twitter since Nov. 4, 2020.

Ye, who is very influential despite his multiple controversies, could help attract Gen Z and Millennials on Twitter. His post on Zuckerberg has already been liked by more than 760,000 people in less than 24 hours.

The rapper and trendsetter has notably reinvented sneakers with his brand Yeezy. His popularity has pushed struggling brands like Adidas and Gap to partner with him.

But the rapper also likes to provoke controversy. It was anti-Semitic remarks made by him on Instagram that prompted the platform to restrict his account. In a since-deleted post from Oct. 7, Ye accused rap legend Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of being controlled by Jews.

The post was denounced by the American Jewish Committee as “anti-Jewish.

Also this week, Ye caused another controversy by repeatedly showing up in a t-shirt that read ""White Lives Matter."" During his fashion show in Paris, models wore t-shirts with a similar message.

For Musk, who has often criticized Twitter for not being exciting enough to convince celebrities and influencers to be active there, Ye's return is a huge victory.

And if Ye could stay active, that would be even better for the tech tycoon, who has already reiterated that his Twitter won't ban people, unless they make comments that break the law of the country where they've been posted.

""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,"" the billionaire posted on April 25."

1066728290,20221009,"Ministers from the OPEC+ group of oil-producing countries agreed to cut their collective output target by 2 million barrels a day from November when they met on Wednesday. How much their actual production falls could be as little as one-tenth of the headline figure. Although the group comprises 23 countries, the burden of the latest cut will be shared by just three — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Most of the others are already pumping so far below their quota levels that their output will still fall short of their new allocations.

When the new targets come into effect on Nov. 1, only eight countries will be required to pump less crude. In addition to the three Gulf Arab neighbors, small reductions should also come from South Sudan, Algeria, Gabon, Iraq and Oman.

OPEC’s own data show that South Sudan not only exceeded its quota every month since the current deal came into effect in May 2020, but that it never cut a single barrel of production. It would be surprising if it began now.

As for Iraq, the nation’s oil minister wasted no time after Wednesday’s deal was finalized to assure oil buyers that the agreement would not affect his country’s exports. With little room to tweak domestic use, that really means no cut in production either.

The cuts required of Saudi Arabia and its neighbors amount to 790,000 barrels a day, but even that could be offset by increasing output from some other members of the group.

Nigeria, Angola and Malaysia are all contending with dwindling production capacity and have been pumping below their targets for many months. That’s not likely to change. Russia, too, is struggling. It was already finding it difficult to keep pace with its rising allocation before President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and the situation has only gotten worse in the months since the invasion.

But Kazakhstan is different. Output is running more than 560,000 barrels a day below target on a combination of planned maintenance at one of its biggest fields and a gas leak at another. The completion of the maintenance this weekend should allow the return of about 260,000 barrels a day. The rest will take longer, but the country’s energy minister says it should be back before the end of the month — just in time to offset the planned cut.

But a month later, the situation may look very different. European Union sanctions on Russian crude exports come into effect on Dec. 5 — the day after the producer group is due to hold its next meeting. The restrictions target most seaborne shipments to the bloc’s members, which have already dropped to about 660,000 barrels a day from 1.6 million barrels in January.

Russia has successfully diverted much of the crude shunned by European buyers to India, Turkey and China; but the sanctions, which also seek to limit shipments to non-European countries, could have a much bigger impact. Russia’s own fleet of tankers isn’t large enough to move all the oil that would need to be diverted from Europe. That could force production cuts. A proposed price cap on Russian crude would provide the Kremlin a way out — exempting from sanctions those cargoes sold at or below a yet-to-be-agreed price — but Moscow seems determined not to take it."
1066735996,20221009,"The president of the Constitutional Court has once again attacked the legal institutions of the European Union, while defending the work of her body.""We are issuing fewer rulings, but this is not because the Court is working worse. We are working very hard to issue a majority ruling,"" Julia Przylebska told private radio broadcaster RMF FM, when asked why in the first half of this year the Constitutional Court issued only seven judgments.""In the administration of justice and the Constitutional Court, the most important thing is to think, to recognize the case in depth, to take into account all the circumstances and to come out with a ruling when there is that majority,"" she explained.The TK president also referred to the words of the Austrian TK president, who said a few days ago that the rule of law is being violated in Poland.""I find the public statements of the presidents of European Constitutional Courts who refer to the tribunals of other countries, including the Polish one, scandalous. This is a violation of state sovereignty and unlawful statements. I myself do not comment on the selection of judges in other countries,"" she stated.When asked why the Court postponed indefinitely the hearing on the EU regulations on the basis of which the CJEU imposed penalties on Poland regarding the Turow mine or the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court, Przylebska replied that the Court did not postpone indefinitely, but at the request of the President and the Foreign Minister, who are participants in the proceedings and wanted more time to prepare their position, changed the date to October 19.According to her, the Court's consideration of the cases related to the financial penalties imposed on Poland may not translate into action by the European Union and stop accruing penalties.""I have the impression that the Polish TK - like the Polish state - is subject to some special irrational, illegitimate EU assessments. Our rulings are being questioned or not taken into account at all. I would like to appeal to the European Union that EU officials should stop saying things, undermining Polish institutions without any legal basis, and stop creating a narrative against the Constitutional Court, an extra-legal narrative, she said.Referring to the Turow case, the president of the Constitutional Court said that the issue has already been settled between Poland and the Czech Republic, and it is unclear why it is still of interest to the European Union.""The European Union should respect the treaties and remember that there are areas of sovereign member states where the EU has no competence. And the meddling of [European Commission head] Ms. [Ursula] von der Leyen in the elections of democratic countries - members of the European Union - is a violation of the treaties,"" she added.Asked how she assesses the state of the rule of law in Poland, the TK president replied that she does not see any problems with the rule of law, and that the European Commission, which is making accusations, lacks arguments."
1066737796,20221009,"Vladimir Putin blamed Ukraine for the explosion that damaged the Kerch Strait Bridge, which was built to link Crimea to Russia after he declared the peninsula’s annexation from Ukraine in 2014. The Russian president called a meeting of his Security Council for Monday.

A fireball that engulfed the bridge on Saturday caused extensive damage, signaling another blow to Putin’s war effort in Ukraine as his troops struggle to hold back a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Russia said train traffic across the bridge has resumed.

Russia struck residential buildings and civil infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia again overnight, with dozens dead or injured. Representatives of the Russian occupying authorities in Luhansk and in Nova Kakhovka in the vicinity of Kherson have reportedly taken their families to Crimea amid advances by Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian troops pushed forward further in Luhansk, moving toward the strategic town of Svatove, the region’s military administration said Sunday on Telegram. The army liberated seven villages, it said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said at least 43 civilians were killed and hundreds of families left homeless since Oct. 3 by Russian missile attacks on residential areas in Zaporizhzhia. He renewed his calls for Ukraine’s allies to step up deliveries of air-defense systems.

“The constant terror against the civilian population is an obvious Russian refusal to engage in real negotiations,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.

President Vladimir Putin blamed “Ukraine’s secret services” for the blast that damaged the bridge linking Crimea and the Russian mainland, calling it a “terrorist attack.”

Alexander Bastrykin, chairman of Russia’s Investigative Commission, told Putin that Russian and foreign citizens assisted Ukraine in preparing the explosion, according to a transcript on the Kremlin’s website.

While Ukrainian officials haven’t claimed responsibility, the country’s postal service commemorated the explosion within hours with a new stamp. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian government adviser, renewed his side’s description of Russia as a terrorist state later Sunday.

The two leaders, during an almost hourlong call on Sunday, denounced Moscow’s latest threats of nuclear escalation as irresponsible and agreed that such a step would have serious consequences for Russia, according to a German government readout. Both condemned Russia’s attempted annexation of Ukrainian territory and pledged to maintain assistance to Ukraine.

Europe’s largest nuclear plant has been reconnected to the grid after losing its off-site power in recent days, which forced it to use backup power, the head of the UN’s atomic safety agency said.

The move is “a temporary relief in a still untenable situation,” Rafael Mariano Grossi said on Twitter. Grossi plans to travel soon to Russia and then back to Ukraine in his bid to establish a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia plant.

The Lavrentiy ferry has arrived to the Black Sea port of Kerch to assist with passenger and car shipments after Saturday’s blast temporarily stopped traffic at the Crimea bridge, Russia’s Transport Ministry said in a statement. Another ferry started operating earlier on Sunday and the ministry said it’s considering bringing in more vessels.

The reason for the gathering wasn’t immediately announced, but will come two days after the damage to the Crimea-Russia bridge. The council is composed of top state officials and the heads of Russia’s defense and security agencies, charged with coordinating national security matters.

Putin last had a meeting with the Security Council nearly two weeks ago, to discuss his order for partial mobilization in Russia. In September he met members of the Council four times, according to Kremlin data.

“It is almost certain that some vehicle transits via the other two carriageways have resumed, but capacity will be seriously degraded,” the UK Defence Ministry said in a Twitter update.

The German government has put together another package to support Ukraine, to the tune of 11 million euros ($10.7 million), according to Der Spiegel.

The aid package, which includes winter clothing, heatable crew tents, mobile power generators and food packages, follows a request for winter equipment from Kyiv. Berlin wants to deliver the equipment as quickly as possible, Der Spiegel reported.

“It is one of the highest priorities for our diplomats to speed up the decision of our partners to provide Ukraine with modern and effective anti-aircraft systems,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address to the nation.

The EU agreed to a new training mission for Ukraine, and plans to train as many as 15,000 of Kyiv’s troops in EU countries this winter, the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reports.

Operational headquarters will be located in Poland and Germany, with an initial mandate of two years. The EU also plans to massively expand military aid to Ukraine within the next months, according to Welt.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry said its ambassador to Belarus was summoned on Saturday night to a meeting where officials accused Kyiv of planning a strike against the territory of Russia’s ally.

“We categorically reject another insinuation of the Belarusian regime,” Ukraine’s ministry said in a statement. “We do not rule out that the handed diplomatic note is part of a Russian Federation provocation plan.” Ukraine called on Belarus “not to succumb to provocations.”

Two missiles were launched by Russian jets from Belarusian air space last week for the first time since late August. They hit the area near Shepetivka in central Ukraine, hundreds of miles from the eastern and southeastern front lines.

Moscow’s troops hit civilian targets in Zaporizhzhia overnight in an airplane missile attack, killing at least 17 people in dozens of apartment buildings, city council secretary Anatoliy Kurtev said on Telegram. Other estimates put the toll at 12 dead so far. Dozens more were hospitalized. At least five homes were also destroyed and dozens damaged. Ukraine’s state security service has opened a probe into attack.

Zaporizhzhia has been under heavy attack from Russian in recent weeks. It’s part of one of four regions illegally annexed by Russian President Vladimir Putin."

1066745746,20221009,"Thousands of voters in Lesotho are casting their ballots this Friday in the southern African kingdom's general elections.

The election will go ahead despite a deadlock in parliament on a whole gamut of major constitutional reforms that were meant to be enacted ahead of the vote so as to bring order to Lesotho's fractious politics.

It is a tight race between the top three parties out of a field of more than 60 registered political parties.

Outgoing Deputy Prime Minister Mathibeli Mokhothu of the Democratic Congress party is running against his coalition partner Nkaku Kabi of the All Basotho Convention and businessman-turned-politician Sam Matekane of the Revolution for Prosperity.

Friday has been declared a public holiday to encourage voting in the tiny mountainous kingdom of 2.1 million people.

The country is entirely surrounded by South Africa.

Lesotho's King Letsie III presides over a constitutional monarchy but has virtually no political power.

Whichever party wins enough representatives in Lesotho's 120-seat National Assembly will select a new prime minister to form a government.

With so many parties contesting the polls, a coalition is very likely.

Polling stations opened at 7am Friday morning, with many voters saying they hoped the election of new leaders would bring change to the country as it faces high levels of employment, increasing crime and political instability.

Many people reportedly lost jobs at factories during the Covid-19 pandemic and some have turned to crime and prostitution to make a living.

According to official statistics, the garment-making industry is Lesotho's largest employer - after the government - and had more than 45,500 textile workers at the beginning of 2020 but about 25 percent of those jobs were lost during the pandemic.

About 320,000 people in Lesotho are currently experiencing a severe food ""crisis"" and are in urgent need of aid ""to save lives, reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition,"" according to the Integrated Food Insecurity Phase Classification.

1066757680,20221009,"Turkey′s shift away from the West since the July 15 coup attempt is a deliberate tactic to strengthen the government′s domestic support base and pursue a more aggressive regional role. Commentary by A. Kadir Yildirim

In the aftermath of the July 15 coup attempt, Turkish foreign policy seems to have set sail to the East. This shift, in contrast to prevailing perceptions, reflects a deliberate choice made by Turkey dating back to the pre-July 15 period. A desire to boost the government′s domestic standing and pursue a more independent and aggressive foreign policy has prompted this change.

Current analyses of Turkish foreign policy tend to urge the West to show greater solidarity with Turkish elected officials and the citizens who opposed extra-democratic interventions. They suggest that Turkey needs ″sensible friends″ at this juncture – during which tens of thousands of individuals have been arrested, detained, dismissed, prosecuted and tortured for the alleged crimes of coup-plotting or terrorism.

Analysts assume the Turkish government is in survival mode, merely responding to domestic and international developments. If somehow Turkey were to exit the Western orbit, blame will rest squarely on the West for failing to accommodate Turkish demands, as Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu claimed. Turkey needs exceptional treatment at this time of existential threat, the argument goes and the West needs to ″understand″ Turkey, implicitly hinting at the West′s failure to do so in 2013 in Egypt.

Yet these analyses miss the intimate, interactive, and ″entangled″ nature of foreign and domestic policies. Just as foreign policy can shape the direction of domestic policy, domestic political considerations can fashion foreign policy in critical ways.

The impending Turkish departure from the Western bloc is not the first of its kind in the Middle East. Indeed, it shares important similarities with Gamal Abdel Nasser′s Egypt or Ruhollah Khomeini′s Iran regarding the populist elements of anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism. Popular leaders fan the flames of these sentiments to populations ravenous for someone to blame.

Yet despite these shared characteristics, geopolitics do not dictate the shift in Turkish foreign policy. Turkey continues to be valued for its strategic importance to the West, as reaffirmed by visits by American and European officials. Likewise, the current government′s ideological convictions and perceived ″Westoxification″ cannot explain such a dramatic shift. The Islamist ideology of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) did not prevent the party from pursuing a decidedly Western foreign policy throughout the 2000s.

Turkey′s foreign policy manoeuvres in response to the coup attempt are premeditated, calculated, and by choice – not reactionary or emotional, as commonly assumed. The impending re-orientation of Turkish policy serves both domestic and international ends.

Domestically, it aims to strengthen the government′s support base, especially in light of increasing criticism of waning liberties in the country. The July 15 coup attempt has created an environment in which the widespread graft allegations from 2013 against leading figures within the AKP, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have been all but forgotten.

Recently, however, two developments introduced fresh international scrutiny to these corruption allegations. An Iranian–Turkish citizen, Reza Zarrab, was arrested in Miami on charges of evading Iranian sanctions. Early court documents hint that he had various connections with high-ranking Turkish officials. In Italy, similarly, President Erdogan′s son Bilal is under investigation for ″laundering around €1 billion ($1.12 billion) in cash″. Both investigations carry the potential to undo the government′s gains in securing domestic legitimacy since 2013.

In recent years, the Turkish government has mastered the art of steering public sensitivities along nationalistic, ethnic, and religious lines, rallying sizeable majorities. That the United States became the focal point of public suspicion in the wake of the July 15 coup attempt (either directly, by organising the coup, or indirectly, by abetting Fethullah Gulen) is no coincidence.

Many Turks believe ″the U.S. wants to damage Erdogan because he is a strong leader who turned Turkey into a regional power.″ Similarly, Turkish officials′ spars with Italian and Austrian prime ministers struck a chord. Strong messages from Turkish officials to re-institute capital punishment similarly risk European Union membership.

Stoking anti-Americanism is an effective means of dealing pre-emptively with the prospect of such international scrutiny; this latest wave of anti-Americanism aims to discredit any future court decision in the United States or Italy as foreign interventions. The fact that the United States has no strategic interest in undermining Turkish power, with a coup or otherwise, is irrelevant.

Internationally, a foreign policy shift will afford Turkey greater independence in entertaining regional (perhaps adventurous) aspirations; it again reflects a deliberate choice at Turkey′s end. The overhaul within the military′s top brass since 15 July is critical.

Thus far, we do not have a good sense of what happened on 15 July, but we do know that most discharged generals were pro-NATO and that American generals complained about their dismissals, expressing concerns ″about ′longer-term′ impacts from the failed coup on counter-terrorism operations.″ Crucially, the void in the Turkish military is bound to be filled with generals close to ″nonaligned and Eurasian perspectives″ and transform its ″strategic culture.″

This is no ordinary shift. The military, particularly the pro-NATO leadership, has acted as the sole mechanism preventing precarious foreign policy making in recent years. Turkey′s Syria policy and the way the military leadership stood its ground is a case in point. The discharge of approximately 45 percent of all generals is sizeable by any measure and indicates careful planning to reshape the military.

The Turkish ambition for a grander role in the region is rooted in its desire to revive a neo-Ottoman order where it plays a leading role in the Middle East. Prior to the onset of the Syrian chaos, Turkey pursued this goal with a prospering economy and creating zones of influence across the region via former foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu′s fanciful ″zero problems″ policy.

However, this approach failed when Syria disintegrated. Instead, the current government brandishes a ″military deterrence″ policy. Turkey′s commitment to NATO, its alliance with the United States, and the pro-NATO generals within the military impede the pursuit of this new independent foreign policy. The purge in the upper echelons of the Turkish military is fateful in this context.

The new foreign policy course the Turkish government desires harnessed the coup attempt to its advantage. By demonising the West as enablers of the putsch, justification for a new page in foreign policy was created to ensure domestic stability. Likewise, by pitching the failed coup as a foreign-backed affair and thus a national security threat, a whole array of restrictive policies, torture, and suppression of dissent have been introduced – all with broad popular support. Hence, it is impossible to conceive of the fast-track evolution of Turkish politics without acknowledging the connection between domestic and foreign policies.

Current developments in Turkey are a harbinger of a worsening Middle East for U.S. foreign policy. It is unclear whether high-level visits by the likes of Secretary of State John Kerry will assuage what might transpire in coming weeks. Despite some critical voices within the European Union, who are calling for ″a new kind of relationship″ and the increasingly unreliable character of Turkish co-operation with the West, Turkey′s sustained partnership with the United States and the West should be a priority. This is imperative to both sides for strategic reasons and for the improvement of the state of human rights and democratisation in Turkey.

Asked the same question about Keir Starmer, she said: “I worked very well with Keir Starmer over Brexit. I’m really disappointed that Keir Starmer has thrown in the towel on the European Union and no longer wants to take the UK or Scotland back into the European Union.

“If the question to me is would I prefer a Labour Government over a Tory government? I detest the Tories and everything they stand for, so It’s not difficult to answer that question.

“But firstly, being better than the Tories is not a high bar to cross right now. I think we need to see more of a radical alternative from Labour rather than just a pale imitation.

“And if you’re asking me do I think either a Westminster Tory Government or a Westminster Labour Government is good enough for Scotland then my answer to that question is no.”

She was also asked about tax and the UK government plan to cut the basic rate of income tax to 19p.

Sturgeon said Scotland had the “best value” tax rates in the UK.

She said: “We have a well-established budget process in Scotland. “We will take the decision based on a balanced consideration.

“This is a really difficult time for people.

“We are doing things to try and lift the incomes of the lowest. We have a Scottish Child payment In Scotland that nobody else in the UK has, £25 a week, soon, for every child in low-income families. We don’t pay for prescriptions, we have free tuition in Scotland so taxpayers in Scotland get good value for money. Better value for money than anywhere else in the UK.”"
1066762218,20221009,"In remarks at a private fundraiser on Thursday night, Joe Biden claimed the world was facing the prospect of “Armageddon’ if Russian President Vladimir Putin used a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.

Biden got a scolding from French President Emanuel Macron for even discussing the use of nuclear weapons. “We must speak with prudence when commenting on such matters,” Macron said at the European Union summit in Prague on Friday. He’s right, of course. Nuclear diplomacy is best conducted in the shadows, given the stakes involved. In 1962, John Kennedy and Nikita Kruschev established a “backchannel” — a trusted go-between who delivered private messages to the two leaders. As the two sides “negotiated” in public and at the UN, a deal was sealed behind the scenes.

But just because Putin is running off at the mouth about using nuclear weapons doesn’t mean Biden has to play that game. Nor does Biden have to let the world know about how the U.S. intends to get Putin off the perilous ledge he’s on.

“We’re trying to figure out: What is Putin’s off-ramp?” Mr. Biden said in a speech at the home of James Murdoch, the son of Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp.

“Where, where does he get off? Where does he find a way out? Where does he find himself in a position that he does not — not only lose face, but lose significant power within Russia?”

In 1962, Kennedy was confronted with the same problem: how to keep Kruschev in power without emasculating him while preventing World War III. Kennedy chose to give the Russian premiere a bone: removing U.S. missiles stationed in Turkey. (The White House spin at the time was that the Jupiter missiles were “obsolete,” which was ludicrous. They were perfectly good nuclear weapons that would detonate no matter how old they were.)

But it was something for Kruschev, and he and the Russian Politburo accepted it.

Kennedy wasn’t dumb enough to muse out loud about the potential weaknesses of Kruschev — a sure-fire way to undercut him in the eyes of the Soviet elites. Suggesting that Putin needed to “save face” to stay in power no doubt worried Putin as well as Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.

It is hard to translate Mr. Biden’s description of the risks into a strategy that fits the moment. No one in the administration wants to suggest, in public or private, that the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky should avoid chasing Russian troops out of every corner of Ukraine, back to the borders that existed on Feb. 23, the day before the invasion began. But behind closed doors, some Western diplomats and military officials say, that is exactly the conversation that may have to happen if the goal is to balance winning back territory against preventing Mr. Putin from lashing out. William Burns, the C.I.A. director and the former U.S. ambassador to Moscow during Mr. Putin’s rise, said on CBS this week that the Russian leader can be “quite dangerous and reckless” when he feels cornered or “feels his back against the wall.”

Indeed, how much should the United States give Putin to satisfy his appetite for territory while keeping the nuclear genie in the bottle? Do we recognize Putin’s illegitimate claims to Crimea? What about Russian minorities in Donetsk? Putin made things extraordinarily complicated with his fraudulent vote to annex four Ukraine provinces. He’s already made a big deal about them being part of “Mother Russia.”

Mr. Zelensky is not going to like any solution that doesn’t include returning every inch of Ukraine’s territory seized by Russia over the last decade. But if nuclear war is to be averted, that’s a probable outcome. Biden will not be able to satisfy both Putin and Zelensky, which means Putin’s “off-ramp” may end up being a slippery slope to nuclear war after all."
1066772136,20221009,"Egypt and Greece on Sunday said a deal allowing Turkish hydrocarbon exploration in Libya's Mediterranean waters was ""illegal"" as Athens said it would oppose it by all ""legal means"".

On Monday, Turkey said it had signed a memorandum of understanding on exploration for hydrocarbons in Libya's seas with the authorities in Tripoli.

""This agreement threatens stability and security in the Mediterranean,"" Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said in Cairo, where he met his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry.

The deal follows an agreement Turkey signed three years ago with Tripoli that demarcated the countries' shared maritime borders.

Greece, Egypt and Cyprus believe the 2019 agreement violates their economic rights in an area suspected to contain vast natural gas reserves.

""We will use all legal means to defend our rights,"" Dendias added.

He said Tripoli ""does not have the necessary sovereignty over this area"", and that the agreement is therefore ""illegal and inadmissible"".

Shoukry charged that the mandate of the authorities in Tripoli has ""expired"" and that ""the government of Tripoli does not have the legitimacy to sign agreements"".

A rival Libyan administration in the war-torn country's east -- which since March has been attempting to take office in Tripoli and also argues the government's mandate has expired -- has rejected the accord.

Monday's deal builds on an agreement signed between Ankara and a previous Tripoli-based administration in 2019, at the height of a battle for the capital after eastern-based military chief Khalifa Haftar attempted to seize it by force.

The delivery of Turkish drones to Tripoli-based forces shortly afterwards was seen as crucial in the victory over Haftar, who was backed at the time by Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.

The question of rights to Libya's vast hydrocarbon resources has become more urgent this year as global energy prices have soared.

The European Union has denounced the 2019 maritime border deal, while France has said the recent agreement was ""not in accordance with international law""."

1066784476,20221009,"Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen secured a second six-year term in office on Sunday by winning a clear majority of votes in an election to avoid a runoff, according to projections based on a partial vote count.

With 95% of the votes cast in polling stations counted, a projection by pollster SORA based on that count put Van der Bellen on 56.1 percent with a margin of error of 1.1 percentage points. His nearest rival was the FPO's Walter Rosenkranz on 17.9 percent.

""Alexander Van der Bellen really managed to ensure in the first round that he will be the next president. I congratulate him on that,"" Rosenkranz told ORF national broadcaster.

The former leader of the Greens has garnered broad popularity by projecting calm during times of national crisis, including the collapse of the government in 2019 and the resignation of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz a year ago over corruption allegations that Kurz denies.

The far-right Freedom Party (FPO) was the only party in parliament to field a candidate against Van der Bellen, who won a much tighter race against an FPO opponent in 2016.

Grandees from all other parties in parliament backed the president.

""It would be nice if we had clarity today,"" the economics professor said after casting his ballot in central Vienna earlier Sunday, adding, ""Nice for Austria, nice for us -- if we can then fully concentrate on the diverse tasks ahead, the multitude of crises... that we in Austria, in Europe, are facing.""

Polls ahead of the election had suggested the pro-European liberal would secure more than 50 percent of the vote, thus avoiding a run-off.

Some 6.4 million people were eligible to cast their ballots from the European Union country's total population of nine million.

""I am in favor of consistency,"" 73-year-old retiree Monika Gregor told AFP outside a Vienna polling station earlier Sunday, saying she had voted for Van der Bellen and thought he was ""very clever"".

Election night projections in Austria, issued after voting ends and based on the count from the polling stations that close earlier in the day, have proved reliable in the past.

""Van der Bellen stands for integrity and stability, which is very appreciated by voters given the multitude of crises that many European countries are currently facing,"" Julia Partheymueller, a political analyst at the University of Vienna, told AFP.

The last polling stations to close include those in the cities of Vienna and Innsbruck.

The Austrian president performs a largely ceremonial role, but also has sweeping powers that mean overseeing periods of transition and turbulence.

The president is the commander in chief of the army and can sack the whole government or the chancellor."

1066784479,20221009,"The Ukrainian military says its forces have recaptured some 1,200 square kilometers of the southern Kherson region since the start of a counterattack against Russian troops in late August.

Natalia Humeniuk, the Southern Ukraine military command spokesperson, said on Sunday that Kiev was making progress on the Kherson front but much had to be done to secure the newly recaptured territories.

“Work is continuing on consolidation of territory, clearing it and conducting stabilizing operations, as the settlements we enter contain many surprises left by the occupiers,” Humeniuk said on Ukrainian national television.

“As of today, from the beginning of the counter-offensive, over 1,170 square kilometers have been liberated in the Kherson direction,” she added.

Ukrainian officials have for long underscored the priority of recapturing Kherson – a flat, agricultural region that Russia captured in its near-entirety in the early days of its military operation in the former Soviet republic.

Any major territorial losses in Kherson would threaten Russia’s supply lines to the Crimean Peninsula further south, which joined Russia in a 2014 referendum.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military operation in Ukraine on February 24. At the time, Putin said one of the goals of what he called a “special military operation” was to “de-Nazify” Ukraine.

The United States and the European Union have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow since the onset of the Russian operation.

The Western states have also been accommodating Ukraine generously with advanced weapons in a move that Moscow says only draws out the conflict.

In another development on Sunday, Russia’s security service FSB said it had seen a “considerable increase” of Ukrainian fire into its territory in recent days, adding that one person had been killed and five wounded in the past week.

“Since the start of October, the number of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations on Russia’s border territory has considerably increased,” said the FSB, which is responsible for border security.

It said the attacks had concentrated on the Russian region of Belgorod, near the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, as well as Bryansk and Kursk.

“More than 100 bombardments were recorded in 32 localities, with the use of multiple rocket launchers, artillery, mortars and drones” in the past week, the FSB explained.

A child was among those wounded, it said, adding that the attacks also “destroyed two electricity stations, 11 residential buildings and two administrative buildings.”"
1066791322,20221009,"European natural gas prices declined amid growing stockpiles and imports of LNG, while the region tries to ease an unprecedented energy crisis.

European natural gas prices declined amid growing stockpiles and imports of liquefied natural gas, while leaders from the region continue to seek ways to ease an unprecedented energy crisis.

Gas storage levels on the continent are now about 90% full -- higher than last year, but still below inventories in October of 2019 and 2020 -- data from Gas Infrastructure Europe show.

Meanwhile, the European Union is considering a temporary limit on gas prices to ward off a potential recession, though it’s not yet clear what kind of mechanism officials will consider. Industry is concerned that such intervention may hinder supplies to Europe at a time when it needs to replace flows that would ordinarily come from Russia.

European countries have increased their gas stockpiles by ramping up LNG inflows month-on-month since June. European imports of liquefied natural gas may jump by 45-50% this year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. However, LNG may only be able to replace about 30% of pipeline shipments from Russia, BI analysts Talon Custer and Patricio Alvarez said in a research note.

Russian gas exports to the region have diminished to a fraction of their levels in the fallout of the country’s invasion of Ukraine in February. While volumes are still passing through Ukraine, other routes have been halted, including the key Nord Stream link to Germany.

“European nations will likely have to refill gas storage in Summer 2023 without the help of Russian gas supplies, meaning they will become more heavily reliant on imported LNG,” Inspired Energy said in a market report.

A cooler-than-expected winter would accelerate draw-down at gas storage facilities, leaving the continent more vulnerable. Temperatures across northwest Europe are expected to drop in the second half of October, forecaster Maxar said in a report.

Dutch front-month gas, a European benchmark, fell as much as 9.8% and traded 6.8% lower at 163.75 euros a megawatt-hour by 11:30 a.m. Amsterdam time. The UK equivalent dropped by 9.7%. German next-month power prices also slipped.

Germany is likely to consume 20% less gas this winter than last year, Deutsche Bank economists in a note. Even so, “rationing might only be avoided by hair’s breadth, both this year and next,” they added."
1066795054,20221009,"Greece and Albania are heading to the International Court in The Hague after both countries failed to agree on the issue of maritime borders, despite both prime ministers meeting on the sidelines of the European political Community in Prague on Thursday, reports Euroactiv.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said that no consensus was found, and the matter would progress to the International Court in The Hague.

“This is a legal process, there are a number of rules, there are a number of procedures, and we will respect the procedures from the beginning to the end because we have to make our position very clear, we have to make it very clear what we intend in this process and that unified attitude required of this court as to what one side intends and what the other side intends, requires its own time. So, we don’t have a consensus between the parties”, said Rama.

At the first meeting of the European Political Community, Rama announced that the countries of the Western Balkans would be part of the discussion with the European Union to face the energy crisis.

“In the round table where I was together with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the main focus was precisely the energy crisis and how our countries, starting with those negotiating membership, will be able to be helped directly. While I have insisted that there should be no difference here and all countries should be included, all six countries”, emphasising previous calls for EU assistance amid soaring prices.

In 2009, the two countries agreed to delimitate the continental shelf in the waters between them, but Prime Minister Edi Rama, at the time in opposition, took the matter to the Constitutional Court."
