1065557741,20221001,"Russia has vetoed a UN Security Council resolution would have condemned the referendums, declared that they have no validity and urged all countries not to recognise the annexation.

China, India, Brazil and Gabon abstained on the vote in the 15-member council.

Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed treaties for an illegal annexation of occupied Ukrainian territory in a sharp escalation of his seven-month invasion of Ukraine.

He vowed to protect the newly annexed regions by “all available means”, a nuclear-backed threat at a Kremlin signing ceremony where he also railed at the West.

Ukraine’s leader immediately countered with a signing ceremony of his own, releasing video of him putting pen to papers that he said were a formal Nato membership request.

Mr Putin’s land-grab and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s signing of what he said is an “accelerated” Nato membership application sent the two leaders speeding even faster on a collision course that is cranking up fears of a full-blown conflict between Russia and the West.

The Russian leader has repeatedly made clear that any prospect of Ukraine joining the world’s largest military alliance is one of his red lines and it was among the justifications he has cited for his invasion.

In his speech, Mr Putin urged Ukraine to sit down for peace talks but immediately insisted he would not discuss handing back occupied regions — keeping him at odds with the Ukrainian government and its western backers which have rejected his land-grab.

Mr Zelenskyy said there would be no negotiations with Mr Putin, adding: “We are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but… with another president of Russia.” In a Kremlin ceremony at the ornate St George’s Hall to herald the annexation of the occupied parts of Ukraine, Mr Putin accused the West of fuelling the hostilities as part of what he said is a plan to turn Russia into a “colony” and a “crowd of slaves”.

The hardening of his position, in a conflict that that has killed and wounded tens of thousands of people, further cranked up tensions, already at levels unseen since the Cold War.

The European Union responded to Mr Putin’s latest step with a joint statement rejecting and condemning “the illegal annexation” of the four regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

The EU’s 27 member states said they will never recognise the illegal referendums that Russia organised “as a pretext for this further violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

Ukraine vowed to continue fighting, and Mr Zelenskyy announced the “accelerated” Nato application, although it was not immediately clear what that would mean, since it requires the unanimous support of the alliance’s members.

“De facto, we have already proven compatibility with alliance standards. They are real for Ukraine – real on the battlefield and in all aspects of our interaction,” Mr Zelenskyy said.

“We trust each other, we help each other, and we protect each other. This is the alliance.” The Kremlin ceremony came three days after the completion in occupied regions of Moscow-orchestrated “referendums” on joining Russia that were dismissed by Kyiv and the West as a bare-faced land grab held at gunpoint and based on lies.

But Mr Putin, in a fiery speech at the ceremony, insisted that Ukraine must treat the Kremlin-managed votes “with respect”.

After the signing ceremony of treaties to join Russia, Moscow-installed leaders of the occupied regions gathered around Mr Putin and linked hands, before joining chants of “Russia! Russia!” with the audience.

Mr Putin also railed at the West, cutting an angry figure as he accused the US and its allies of seeking to destroy Russia. He said the West acted “as a parasite” and used its financial and technological strength “to rob the entire world”.

He portrayed Russia as being on a historical mission to reclaim its post-Soviet great power status and counter western domination which he said is collapsing.

“History has called us to a battlefield to fight for our people, for the grand historic Russia, for future generations,” he said.

Russia later vetoed a UN Security Council resolution would have condemned the referendums, declared that they have no validity and urged all countries not to recognise the annexation.

China, India, Brazil and Gabon abstained on the vote in the 15-member council.

The separatist Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine have been backed by Moscow since declaring independence in 2014, weeks after the annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.

The southern Kherson region and part of neighbouring Zaporizhzhia were captured by Russia soon after Mr Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24.

Both houses of the Kremlin-controlled Russian parliament will meet next week to rubberstamp the treaties for the regions to join Russia, sending them to Mr Putin for his approval.

He has bluntly warned Ukraine against pressing an offensive to reclaim the regions, saying Russia would view it as an act of aggression – threats that Moscow can back up with the world’s largest arsenal of nuclear warheads.

Russia controls most of the Luhansk and Kherson regions, about 60% of Donetsk and a large chunk of Zaporizhzhia, where it took control of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant.

Mr Zelenskyy vowed to keep fighting, saying: “The entire territory of our country will be liberated from this enemy. Russia already knows this. It feels our power.”"
1065554124,20221001,"The U.S. and its allies have promised to adopt even more sanctions than they've already levied against Russia and to offer millions of dollars in extra support for Ukraine as the Kremlin duplicates the annexation playbook it followed when it incorporated Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

Heightening the tensions are Russia's partial military mobilization and allegations of sabotage of two Russian pipelines on the Baltic Sea floor that were designed to feed natural gas to Europe. Adding to the Kremlin’s woes are Ukraine's success in recapturing some of the very land Russia is annexing and problems with the mobilization that President Vladimir Putin acknowledged Thursday.

Ukraine's Western supporters have described the stage-managed referendums on whether to live under Russian rule as a bald-faced land grab based on lies. They say some people were forced to vote at gunpoint in an election without independent observers on territory from which thousands of residents have fled or been forcibly deported.

In an apparent effort to calm the population in the face of domestic criticism and confusion, Putin told Russia's Security Council on Thursday that mistakes had been made in the mobilization. He said Russian men mistakenly called up should be sent home and that only reservists with proper training and specialties should be summoned to serve.

Finland closed one of the last ways out for Russians. It's banning Russian citizens with tourist visas from entering the country starting Friday. With the exception of Norway, which has only one border crossing with Russia, Finland has provided the last easily accessible land route for Russian holders of Schengen visas, which allow free movement across much of Europe."
1065554131,20221001,"Sanctions, censure and condemnation: Ukraine and its Western allies reacted decisively to Vladimir Putin's move to illegally annex four occupied regions of eastern Ukraine on Friday, amid a chorus of criticism from around the world.

Russia's Baltic neighbour Estonia said it ""will never recognise"" the results of the referendums, adding that ""irresponsible threats against the West will not deter Western countries from supporting Ukraine until Russia has lost the war.""

Another neighbour, Finland, which has the EU's longest border with Russia also strongly condemned Putin's annexation of Ukrainian territory saying the referendums ""don't change the map.""

""Ukraine’s sovereignty and territory is indivisible and inviolable. Finland will not recognise the results of the illegal referenda or annexations,"" said President Sauli Niinistö.

French President Emmanuel Macron said his country would ""continue to stand alongside Ukraine to confront Russian aggression and allow Ukraine to recover its full sovereignty over all of its territory;"" while

Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde said ""We do not and will never recognise the illegal 'referenda' that Russia has engineered"" after a joint press conference with the Nordic nation's prime minister and defence minister.

Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra described Russia's illegal annexation as ""utterly unacceptable"" and said that there was ""no place for this type of violent imperialism in the 21st century.""

And new British Prime Minister Liz Truss said ""Vladimir Putin is once again violating international law with his threats to annex more of Ukraine.""

The European Union External Action Service branded the Russian move as ""bluster and hollow propaganda,"" while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg underscored that all the annexed regions are part of Ukraine, not Russia.

The White House also condemned Russia's ""fraudulent attempt to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory,"" the US national security adviser calling it a ""a flagrant violation of international law"" and insisting it has no legitimacy.

""America and its allies are not going to be intimidated by Putin and his reckless words and threats,"" said President Joe Biden.

A vote in the United Nations Security Council on a draft resolution condemning the annexation of eastern Ukraine did not pass on Friday evening after Russia, a UNSC permanent member, vetoed it.

Ten countries voted in favour, including the US, UK, France, Albania, Ghana, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Norway and the UAE; while four countries abstained: China, Brazil, India and Gabon. Only Russia voted against the measure.

Although the resolution was ultimately vetoed at the Security Council, Britain's foreign minister said the ""efforts to 'annex' the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are a serious breach of the UN Charter.""

""Yet again, Russia has abused its veto to defend its illegal actions,"" said Barbara Woodward, the UK Ambassador to the UN. ""Council members have voted in different ways. But one thing is clear. Not a single other member of this council recognises Russia's attempted illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory. Russia's veto doesn't change that fact.""

Both the UK and US have imposed more sanctions on Russia after the move to annex four Ukrainian regions.

Britain's sanctions include a freeze on the assets of the country’s central bank governor, who has been instrumental in steering the Russian economy since the invasion of Ukraine and extending the ruble into Ukrainian territory under Russian control. She will also be barred from traveling to the UK.

The British government also imposed bans on the export of an additional 700 products to Russia, and UK companies will be barred from providing services such as auditing, advertising, engineering, some types of legal advice and information technology consulting services to Russian firms.

Meanwhile the US is sanctioning more than 1,000 people and firms connected to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including its Central Bank governor and families of Security Council members.

The Treasury Department named hundreds of members of Russia’s legislature, leaders of the country’s financial and military infrastructure and suppliers for sanctions designations. The Commerce Department added 57 companies to its list of export control violators, and the State Department added more than 900 people to its visa restriction list."
1065554133,20221001,
1065554134,20221001,"President Vladimir Putin announced Russia would seize of nearly a fifth of Ukraine on Friday, declaring that the millions of people living there would be Russian citizens “forever.”

Under the annexation process, which is illegal under international law, Moscow will recognize four Ukrainian regions as Russian territory: Luhansk and Donetsk — home to two Russian-backed breakaway republics where fighting has been ongoing since 2014 — as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, two areas in southern Ukraine that have been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began.

Putin’s announcement, made in a formal speech at the Kremlin’s opulent St. George’s Hall on Friday, follows so-called referendums in the regions that were universally dismissed as “shams” by Ukraine and Western nations.

Putin, however, attempted to claim that the referendums reflected the will of “millions” of people, despite reports from the ground suggesting that voting took place essentially — and in some cases, literally — at gunpoint. Western leaders have slammed the polls, saying that they fail to meet internationally recognized standards of free and fair elections.

The annexation announcement was met with a similar outcry. Members of the G7 — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — and the European Union have vowed to never recognize Russian sovereignty over the regions and to impose sanctions on Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington would place visa restrictions on 910 individuals in Russia and Belarus, while a Biden administration official said the White House would impose “swift and severe costs” on Russia. The British government said it would implement services sanctions and an export ban that target “Russian economic vulnerabilities.”

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky called the move a “farce” in a pre-recorded video statement released shortly after Putin’s speech and vowed that “the entire territory of our country will be liberated.” Zelensky also said his country would apply for NATO membership “under an accelerated procedure,” but it’s unclear how long such a process would take. New NATO members must meet a series of criteria for membership and be unanimously approved by current alliance members.

“We see who threatens us,” Zelensky said. “It is in Ukraine that the fate of democracy in the confrontation with tyranny is being decided.

Despite the widespread condemnation, Russia appears committed to forging ahead with its plans to fly its flag over some 100,000 square kilometers (38,600 square miles) of Ukrainian territory — the largest forcible annexation of land in Europe since 1945.

In his speech, Putin framed the annexation as an attempt to fix what he sees as a great historical mistake: Russia’s demise following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and continued Western efforts to keep the country weak.

He repeated his unfounded allegation that genocide was being committed against Russian speakers — one of the false pretenses Russia used to invade Ukraine in February.

The address, on the whole, was a commitment by the Russian leader to continue pursuing his major foreign policy aim: restoring Russia as a major global power charged with protecting the Russian speaking world from the continued threat posed by Western forces.

“We remember the horrible and hungry 1990s, but Russia has survived and became stronger. And it has its place in the world,” Putin said. “But the West is still trying to make us weaker, to split us into parts.”

A new phase of the conflict

The annexations could lay the groundwork for a dangerous new phase in Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have, in recent weeks, successfully expelled Russian forces from parts of Donetsk thanks in part to the advanced weaponry sent by the US and other allies. Kyiv now controls about 40% of Donetsk, though many towns and cities bear scars of war that will take years to heal.

Now that Russia formally recognizes Donetsk as its own territory, the Kremlin is likely to push forward to recapture it using some of the 300,000 Russian citizens who will be conscripted as part of a “partial mobilization” Putin announced last week.

“It will have to be liberated,” said Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, shortly before the speech.

Putin said Friday that while he was willing to negotiate with Ukraine, the sovereignty of those four regions would not be on the table.

“I want the Kyiv authorities and their real masters in the West to hear me. For everyone to remember. People living in Luhansk and Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are becoming our citizens. Forever,” the Russian president said during the annexation ceremony.

Putin has previously vowed to defend Russian territory “with all the means at our disposal,” including nuclear weapons. US officials have said that they don’t believe Putin would resort to tactical nuclear weapons — a type of bomb designed for use on the battlefield that is less powerful than traditional “strategic” nuclear weapons — though they cannot discount the possibility.

“We are looking very carefully to see if Russia is actually doing anything that suggests that they are contemplating the use of nuclear weapons. To date, we’ve not seen them take these actions,” US Secretary of State Blinken said Friday.

Analysts believe that Putin hopes the annexations will help shift public opinion in Russia in favor of what the Kremlin euphemistically calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.

The Russian leader enjoyed stratospheric approval ratings after Crimea was annexed after a similar so-called referendum in 2014, but that was done in a largely bloodless manner using “little green men” — Russian special operations troops who poured over the border into the peninsula ahead of the annexation.

This invasion of Ukraine has proven to be a bloody, seemingly intractable conflict that has cost the Russian military countless lives. Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilization” last week led many Russians who do not support the war to fear that they will be drawn into the conflict.

More than 200,000 people — many of them young men of fighting age — have fled Russia since the partial mobilization began. Several who spoke with CNN voiced fears that the government could impose a draft at a later date.

Inside Russia, the renewed war effort — and its apparent botched rollout — has been met in some corners with anger. Reports emerged of men being improperly conscripted, which Putin appeared to acknowledge on Thursday when he demanded that “mistakes” related to the order be rectified.

Activist groups have said ethnic minorities in Russia are being disproportionately mobilized. Heated protests broke out in several regions with significant ethnic minority populations, including the predominately Muslim region of Dagestan.

Meanwhile, small demonstrations were reported last week in 38 Russian cities — including Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to independent monitoring group OVD-Info. A spokeswoman for the organization told CNN some of the protesters arrested by riot police were being drafted directly into Russia’s military.

1065561766,20221001,"The United States and Russia traded barbs and accusations at a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday about the apparent sabotage to a major gas pipeline that Russia uses to supply Europe.

Between Sept. 26 and 29, explosions caused four leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines that run along the floor of the Baltic Sea.

The United States, European Union, NATO and Russia all agree the damage and gas leaks point to sabotage, but they disagree about who is the likely perpetrator.

Russia requested the Security Council meeting to discuss the pipeline incident.

""It's quite clear to us that carrying out of sabotage of such complexity and scale is beyond the power of ordinary terrorists,"" Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said at the meeting. ""We consider the actions to damage the gas pipelines to be deliberate sabotage against a crucial element of the Russian Federation's energy infrastructure.""

He reiterated Kremlin talking points, saying that it could not have happened without the involvement of a state or state-controlled actors, and that Moscow would ""certainly identify"" the perpetrators.

""I hope, colleagues, that everyone in this room is aware of the dangerous brink to which those who committed this sabotage are leading us,"" he said.

Nebenzia implied that the United States had the most to gain by damaging the pipeline, and directly asked his U.S. counterpart if he could confirm that Washington was not involved.

""Let me be clear: The United States categorically denies any involvement in this incident, and we reject any assertions saying the contrary,"" U.S. envoy Richard Mills responded.

Mills accused Russia of using the Security Council as a platform to launch conspiracy theories and disinformation. He noted that since Russia invaded Ukraine seven months ago, it has repeatedly damaged and destroyed civilian infrastructure there.

""If there is any country, perhaps, that has a record of doing what we are discussing here today, it's not the United States,"" Mills noted.

Some European officials and energy experts have suggested that Russia likely carried out the attacks to benefit from higher energy prices and to create more economic chaos in Europe for its support of Ukraine in fending off Russia's war. But other officials urged caution in assessing blame until investigators determine what happened.

The damage to the pipelines happened off the shores of Sweden and Denmark. Ahead of Friday's meeting, their ambassadors sent a joint letter to the Security Council president. They said at least two underwater detonations occurred on Sept. 26, damaging pipelines on Nord Stream 1 and 2 and causing ""major leaks"" of natural gas several hundred meters wide.

The cause was likely two massive explosions, ""probably corresponding to an explosive load of several hundred kilos,"" which were ""the result of a deliberate act."" The blasts were so powerful, they said, that they measured 2.3 and 2.1 on the Richter scale, which is used to gauge earthquakes.

They warned that the gas plumes pose a risk to both sea and air traffic, and they instituted a navigation warning to ships to maintain a distance of at least 5 nautical miles, or 10 kilometers, from the leaks.

Danish, Swedish and German authorities are carrying out a joint investigation. Russia's ambassador said Moscow would only accept the results of an independent investigation that included Russian experts.

On Thursday, NATO vowed retaliation for attacks on the critical infrastructure of its 30 member states.

""Any deliberate attack against allies' critical infrastructure would be met with a united and determined response,"" NATO ambassadors said in a statement.

The bloc said the four ruptures in the Nord Stream pipelines were of ""deep concern"" and agreed that current information pointed to ""deliberate, reckless and irresponsible acts of sabotage.""

Two of the leaks are on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, where the flow of gas was recently halted, while the other two are on Nord Stream 2, which has never been opened.

Although they were not in operation, both pipelines were filled with methane gas, which has escaped and is bubbling to the surface."

1065572974,20221001,"A network of two dozen organizations has been tasked with the critical role of helping Ukrainians who claim to have been sexually assaulted by Russian soldiers since the start of Vladimir Putin’s devastating war in Ukraine.

The network operates throughout the country, often in some of the war’s most dangerous hotspots, and offers anonymous support to anyone who requests help, ranging from sending rape kits to Russian-occupied villages to providing trauma support to survivors of sexual violence.

“We obtain information about alleged human rights violations including conflict-related sexual violence through a variety of sources,” a spokesperson for the UN’s Human Rights Mission in Ukraine told The Daily Beast. Once the sources are verified, they gather all of the information they have received and use a “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof which, if it meets all of the elements of sexual violence, will be recorded.

Despite the intricate system created by these organization, the number of “verified cases” of sexual violence in the Ukraine war stands at just 43 assaults, 20 of which were reportedly against women or girls, with 23 against men. The number is staggeringly low, and inside Ukraine, the network believes that the true number of rape survivors is likely to be much higher, given that in conflict zones only one in every 10 to 20 rapes are reported.

‘They’ll Give Me a Medal’: The Dark Reality of Russian Troops’ Alleged War-Crime Rapes

Each member of the network plays a different role, and in the early days of the war, one those networks, La Strada Ukraine, established two national hotlines for people to call with reports of possible human trafficking. Since then, the NGO has received calls relating to women, men, and children who have been sexually assaulted by civilians and members of the Russian military. The exact number of people La Strada has helped is unknown, but it receives reports of sexual assault every day.

“[It’s] not limited to rape. It also can take many other forms. Sexual exploitation also takes place because of heightened vulnerability of these women,” Yuilia Ansova, a lawyer for La Strada, told The Daily Beast in an interview.

Recently, La Strada received a call about a 17-year-old girl in foster care who went missing while crossing from Ukraine to Poland alone. The girl had been in touch with her foster family before leaving Ukraine and was supposed to meet a volunteer from Poland to ensure her safe arrival. She has not been heard from since. Ansova said that there is no way to know what happened to her, but there is a possibility that she was a victim of sex trafficking. Since La Strada works anonymously, there is no way to follow up to try to find any new information about the girl.

When speaking with survivors of sexual abuse is possible, another network, Sylini Ukraine, works to cover their medical expenses. Sylini works with victims who remain anonymous and, since the beginning of the war, has funded the cost of recovery for eight women, including dental surgery, STD tests, psychological support, and in some cases, abortions.

The number of requests from survivors has grown in recent months. From May to June, 18 survivors of rape reached out to Sylini for help. Some wanted help covering medical costs, while others just wanted to ask questions, often disappearing once their questions are answered. Sylini might not hear from them again, but if the organization is needed, it is ready to help.

“It’s extremely important to give people information and to remind them that it’s OK if you’re not ready to get help,” Anastasia Krasnoplakhtych, a representative of Sylini Ukraine, told The Daily Beast over Zoom. “People want to forget about this crime, and they want to rebuild their lives. A lot of people who write to us ask, ‘Can you help me with some issue?’ and then they disappear.”

While there is no specific demographic of people Sylini helps, they often receive an influx of requests from territories liberated from Russian occupation. Younger survivors are more likely to choose psychological help over medical, whereas older survivors are more focused on getting rid of all physical evidence of their assault than on speaking with a psychologist.

“People [who] have experienced sexual violence shouldn’t be expected to behave in a way that is typical, or the same for everyone. So someone can be very aggressive, other people can freeze and not be ready to contact at all, and others can cry,” Krasnoplakhtych said.

“But the responses of people who have experienced sexual violence depend on a person’s mental state before sexual abuse, on their age, or past experience of sexual violence in their life,” she added.

Along with financial support and resources set up to support survivors, some NGO workers drive to the homes of survivors in Russian-occupied territories, where communication is scarce. That includes members of SEMA Ukraine, a group made up of survivors of sexual violence, some of whom were assaulted by Russian troops in Crimea in 2014.

SEMA could not be reached directly for comment, but its partner, The International Council of Polish Women+, has worked closely with SEMA, documenting each instance where rape could have been used as a war crime. When SEMA is able to visit small villages on the outskirts of Kyiv, it will often count at least three cases of rape. In the war’s hotspots, such as Bucha and Mariupol, the number is usually much higher.

“They [SEMA] are traveling to small towns themselves, using their own money to meet victims in person and counsel them,” Agnieszka Rutkowska, a member of The International Council of Polish Women+, told The Daily Beast. While women are a primary target of sexual violence in Ukraine, Rutkowska said that the network is aware of instances where men and children are victims as well, though they are often less reported.

The network also offers help and advice to survivors of rape who are now pregnant, including the option of abortion. In the midst of having their homes destroyed, losing loved ones, and being sexually assaulted, survivors must not only process the trauma of the assault but also deal with the physical aftermath. Many of those survivors have fled to Poland for safety, but when they arrive, they are met with some of the strictest abortion laws in the European Union.

In January 2021, Poland’s Constitutional Tribune banned access to abortions in almost all circumstances, except when someone has been raped or their life is at risk. But establishing that a rape has taken place takes time, and abortions are only allowed in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. As a result, only 1,000 legal abortions take place in Poland each year. “Imagine the level of stress that the woman is going through during those few weeks of uncertainty, and she might change her mind several times,” said Rutkowska.

“I think the problem is that Ukrainian women hadn’t expected what they saw when they came to Poland—that they couldn’t have had abortion as they could have in Ukraine,” she added.

In an attempt to get a legal abortion, some Ukrainian refugees have been forced to travel to other European Union countries to terminate a pregnancy. The journey has made some pro-choice activists draw comparisons between abortion access in Europe and the “Post Roe” era in the U.S., where the Supreme Court recently overturned the constitutional right to abortion.

It’s Official: The Supreme Court Has Overturned Roe v. Wade

At the beginning of the war, a Ukrainian woman emailed Cocia Basia, an abortion access group in Berlin made up of Polish-speaking volunteers. The woman said she had just lost her husband and her home in Russia’s invasion. She was pregnant and needed an abortion. “I don’t have a house, I cannot keep this pregnancy,” she wrote, according to Ciocia Basia member Zuzanna Dziuban, who had been reduced to tears after reading the email.

Abortions are technically illegal in Germany, but they can be administered under certain circumstances in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy at doctors’ clinics. Dziuban estimates that Ciocia Basia and its partners have helped at least 500 pregnant people coming from Ukraine get an abortion since March.

“It’s incredibly infuriating because abortion bans are closely associated with stigma, with people doing it in secrecy not being very often not being aware of the fact that they cannot be criminalized for having their own abortions,” Dziuban told The Daily Beast. “They’re often alone when doing this… We didn’t think that [this] still exists in 2022. We have to stay alert. The U.S. shows how easy it is to take things from us that we fought for such a long time, and Poland also shows us how easily those rights can be taken away from us.”

1065572976,20221001,"By attempting to annex further Ukrainian territories, Russia has constituted a new “low point” in its blatant flouting of international law, which should receive a proper assessment of the entire international community.

This is said in G7 Foreign Ministers’ statement on the illegal annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, which was published on the website of the Federal Foreign Office of Germany that took over the G7 Presidency, Ukrinform reports.

The G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, unanimously condemned in the strongest possible terms of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and its continued violations of Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.

“President Putin’s efforts to incorporate Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions into the territory of the Russian Federation constitute a new low point in Russia’s blatant flouting of international law, and yet another example of Russia’s unacceptable violations of Ukraine’s sovereignty, the UN Charter, and the commonly agreed principles and commitments of the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter. We will never recognise these purported annexations, nor the sham ‘referenda’ conducted at gunpoint… We reaffirm that the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya as well as Crimea are integral parts of Ukraine,” the statement says.

The ministers reiterate their call for all countries to condemn unequivocally Russia’s war of aggression and its attempt to acquire territory by force.

“We call on the broader international community to reject Russia’s brutal expansionism, its efforts to deny Ukraine's existence as an independent state, and its blatant violation of the international norms that guarantee international peace, security, and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states,” the statement says.

The G7 countries promise to impose further economic costs on Russia, and on individuals and entities – inside and outside of Russia – that provide political or economic support to these violations of international law.

“We are unwavering in our support for Ukraine’s right to defend itself against Russia’s war of aggression and its unquestionable right to reclaim its territory from Russia,” the statement says.

“Russia must immediately stop its war of aggression, withdraw all of its troops and military equipment from Ukraine, and respect Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders,” the statement says."

SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Azerbaijan’s president said Friday that his country is a reliable partner and will stick to an agreement to double gas exports to the European Union by 2027.

Speaking to reporters in Bulgaria’s capital, President Ilhan Aliyev called a new gas interconnector with Greece “a historic achievement and an opportunity for Azeri gas to reach Europe in larger quantities.”

Aliyev was in Sofia for the official launch Saturday of a new pipeline that will supply natural gas from Azerbaijan to Bulgaria, whose vital supply of Russian gas was cut off in April amid the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine .

At the event on Saturday, he will join heads of state and governments from the region, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The 182-kilometer (115-mile) pipeline is designed to run from the northeastern Greek city of Komotini to Stara Zagora in central Bulgaria. It is expected to start with an initial capacity of 3 billion cubic meters of gas a year, with the prospect of future expansion to 5 billion cubic meters.

Bulgarian President Rumen Radev stressed the importance of the new gas link not only for Bulgaria, but for the continent. “It decisively changes the energy map of Europe,” he said.

The desire for other sources of gas increased significantly after Moscow decided to turn its natural gas deliveries into a political weapon.

In late April, Russia cut off gas supplies to Bulgaria after it refused Moscow’s demand to pay for the deliveries in rubles, Russia’s currency. Relations between the two former Soviet bloc allies have tanked in recent months, and last month Bulgaria ordered the expulsion of 70 Russian diplomats, triggering an angry response from Moscow.

Bulgaria, which has a contract for 1 billion cubic meters of Azeri gas, or one-third of the country’s annual needs, wants to increase the volume by between a half-billion to 1 billion cubic meters more per year following the suspension of Russian gas flows were suspended.

Radev said he received a letter Thursday from gas system operators in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia that offered to transport gas from Azerbaijan using the integrated networks of their countries. He said Bulgaria could host a summit of the four countries to discuss possibilities for such gas transfers.

The topic has become important after Russia said it would suspend some maintenance and repair work of a gas pipeline that supplies Turkey and countries like Serbia and Hungary.

1065583474,20221001,"Far-right leader Giorgia Meloni, who won the Italian election last week, said on Friday Russia’s annexation of occupied Ukrainian regions had no legal or political basis, warning Moscow’s “neo-imperialism” threatens all of Europe. “The declaration of annexation to the Russian Federation of four Ukrainian regions following sham referendums held under violent military occupation has no legal or political value,” Meloni said in a statement. Russian President Vladimir Putin “once again demonstrates his neo-imperialist, Soviet-style vision, which threatens the security of the entire European continent”, she said. “This further violation by Russia of the rules of coexistence between nations confirms the need for unity by Western democracies.” Her comment reflects a joint statement by European Union leaders — including Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi — which said they would “never recognise” the annexation. Meloni’s populist Eurosceptic Brothers of Italy party, which has neo-Fascist roots, won 26 percent of the vote in Sunday’s general election, putting her on course to become prime minister. She has strongly backed EU sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, although her coalition allies, far-right leader Matteo Salvini and ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi, both have a history of warm ties with Moscow."
1065583475,20221001,"The European Union Friday unveiled tighter visa requirements for Russians that would throw difficult — and, for some, impossible — hurdles up for them to enter the bloc except on humanitarian grounds. The move comes as thousands have fled Russia — mainly to its non-EU neighbours — in an attempt to avoid the military mobilisation ordered by President Vladimir Putin as Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has been dealt setbacks.

There have been splits between EU nations over how to deal with Russian draft dodgers as eastern members bordering Russia have taken a tough line and others like Germany offer possible refuge. The updated guidelines presented by the European Commission would subject Russians applying for short-stay Schengen visas to much tougher scrutiny and longer delays.

European border guards would also have more leeway to reassess already issued visas and reject or cancel them after fresh assessment. The changes follow demands from EU member states along the frontier with Russia for an outright ban on visas for Russians.

Finland from Friday closed its border to Russians holding Schengen visas, which are typically issued for tourism purposes for a stay of up to three months in any of the 26 countries making up the internally passport-free zone. The update focuses on “the security threat towards us” as Russia escalates its war footing over Ukraine, which is being strongly supported by the European Union, EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson told journalists. “The security threat is real. The EU will protect itself and our citizens,” she said.

She noted that the European Union has already halted a visa-facilitation agreement with Russia, and stopped issuing visas to Russian officials and figures deemed to be involved with Moscow’s war on Ukraine. The guidelines say Russians wanting a Schengen visa need to apply from their country of residence — usually Russia — and not elsewhere. They must show a pressing reason for travel, otherwise their application will be given less priority in EU consulates that have reduced resources for visa processing.

Documents proving they will leave the Schengen area before the three-month limit will be rigorously studied. And compulsory travel medical insurance underwritten by Russian insurers will not be accepted — a tough criterion for Russians largely excluded from Western markets. Johansson stressed that there were however exceptions for humanitarian reasons, national interest or international obligations. Thus visas for Russian independent journalists, dissidents, pupils, students and researchers could be facilitated, and they could apply outside their country of residence if they qualify."
1065584782,20221001,"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam — Russian birch wood has continued to flow to American consumers, disguised as Asian products, despite U.S. economic sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, a new report says. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), a nonprofit watchdog group based in Britain, has found that most birch products currently being exported from Vietnam to the United States originate in Russia. According to Vietnam customs data, roughly 40,000 cubic meters of birch wood is transported every month from Russia and China into Vietnam, where it’s assembled into furniture and plywood.

The group’s investigators spoke to five Chinese companies accounting for 60 percent of China’s birch veneer exports to Vietnam and concluded that over 90 percent of their birch is sourced from Russia. One Chinese wood factory owner told the group that all of the birch their company uses comes from Russia but is repackaged in China and re-exported to Vietnam with China listed as the country of origin.

In construction, birch harvested from Russia’s vast forests has long been considered the best source of plywood — a material used in floors, ceilings and partitions, as well as for decorative purposes on items such as doors and cabinets.

Before the invasion of Ukraine, the United States imported hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of birch plywood from Russia annually, trade data shows. Driven by strong demand, these imports surged in the early months of 2022 before changing course in April, when the Biden administration raised tariffs on Russian birch from 10 percent to 50 percent. From March to April, even as direct U.S. imports of Russian birch plunged, birch plywood imports from Vietnam grew by 206 percent, said the Decorative Hardwoods Association, which represents American hardwood industries.

Ngo Sy Hoai, vice president of the Vietnam Timber and Forest Product Association, a nongovernmental trade organization in Vietnam, did not respond to questions on where companies are sourcing their birch, saying only that “Vietnamese plywood producers may import certain volumes of birch wood from various sources for plywood surfacing.”

Phuc Xuan To, a senior policy analyst at Forest Trends who has studied Vietnam’s wood industry for years, confirmed the EIA’s findings. Sawed birch timber imports from China to Vietnam increased in the first half of this year, and it’s highly likely that birch originated in Russia, To said.

Russian birch is also appearing under deceptive labels in markets outside the United States, according to advocacy groups. Companies in Britain have recently received more offers of birch “from the Far East,” said Timber Development UK, which represents companies throughout the timber supply chain in Britain.

“Given that birch forests are concentrated in Northern Russia and Eurasia; it is almost certain the birch contained in the plywood being offered has in fact originated in Russia,” the trade association said in a statement warning members against running afoul of British sanctions.

Mining tycoon Alexei Mordashov, who was blacklisted by the European Union in March, holds major assets in Sveza, one of Russia’s biggest exporters of birch plywood, Earthsight said. While Sveza’s direct exports to Europe have declined since the start of the year, company leaders recently told reporters that it has been actively redirecting supply to Asia and Africa. “I have absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension,” Mordashov said in a statement in April.

Telecommunications billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov’s family controls Sistema, parent company of Segezha, a logging firm that exports to the European Union and the United States. In April, after being sanctioned by Britain, Yevtushenkov gave up shareholder control over the Sistema conglomerate by transferring 10 percent worth of assets to his son. The Segezha group released a statement around the same time declaring that it did not consider itself affected by British sanctions. “Segezha Group continues its business as usual,” the statement said."
1065590503,20221001,"Following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of the annexation of four partially-occupied Ukrainian areas, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated on Friday that his nation is submitting an “accelerated” application to join the NATO military alliance.

Zelenskyy stated, “We are taking our crucial move by signing Ukraine’s application for fast membership to NATO. According to a statement made public by the European Council, the Kremlin has been charged with endangering international security. The European Council is an organisation made up of the presidents of the 27 member states of the European Union.

Leaders of the European Union swore not to “ever accept” Russia’s “illegal” takeover of the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

The member nations reportedly stated that they would never recognise the fraudulent and unlawful results of the illegitimate “referenda” that Russia organised to cover up this another violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

The member nations declared the decision to be invalid and said that it was incapable of having any sort of legal impact. “Ukraine includes Crimea, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk. We demand that this unlawful annexation be categorically rejected by all nations and international organisations “the sentence included

The annexation of four regions—Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia—was officially proclaimed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. He said that “this is the choice of millions of people.”

Putin reportedly stated that the inhabitants of the four annexed territories will henceforth be “citizens for life” of Russia.

In a lengthy address at a Kremlin event announcing the acquisition of Ukrainian territory, Putin stated, “There are four new regions of Russia.” According to media reports, the address was replete with harsh criticism of Ukraine and its Western backers.

Putin criticised Western nations, who have imposed severe sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, while simultaneously denying that he was trying to revive the Soviet Union through the aforementioned annexation.

Putin went on to say that Russia will now protect its new territory “with all the tools at its disposal” in a resounding declaration.

According to media reports, the Russian President defended his country’s choice to hold the referendum and declare the annexation of the area by saying that the residents of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia had an “integral right” to become a part of Russia.

Putin went on to say that the residents of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine were “victims of cruel terrorist acts carried out by the Kyiv dictatorship.”

Additionally, he referred to the referendum’s outcome as “the will of millions of people.”

President Putin has issued a proclamation recognising the purported “independence” of the Ukrainian provinces Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, marking a significant move by Russia.

Additionally, according to media sources, the UN Security Council is scheduled to vote on a resolution on Friday that will criticise Russia for holding referenda in four territories that it controls but that Ukraine claims.

Any acquisition of a state’s territory by another state brought about by a “threat or use of force,” according to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, is against international law and the UN charter.

According to reports in the media, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of annexing parts of Ukraine and declared that this was against international law. The senior US ambassador declared that the US will never recognise Moscow’s annexation, calling Moscow’s action a “land grab.”

Blinken stated in a statement that “the Kremlin’s phoney referenda are a failed effort to disguise what amounts to a further attempt at a land grab in Ukraine.”

1065598713,20221001,"“Of course, now there is more schizophrenia in Russia on this topic, (claims) that someone did it insidiously – conspiracy theories, special services,” the diplomat said.

“But in fact, the question is very simple: who benefits from this? Today, it’s beneficial only to the Russian regime.”

According to Klimkin, this is because Russia has realized that it has lost the energy war against Europe.

“And they want to put (an end to the business) right now and say there will be no gas now,” he said.

“After that, they will (attempt to) rock Europe in such a way as to reboot the entire political elite – no more, no less. This is also perfectly clear to the European Union today.”

Klimkin said Russia had already accepted that it would no longer be selling its gas in the European Union.

“Even the Germans are going to Canada, Qatar, and the Emirates and sign contracts for the supply of liquefied gas,” Klimkin said..

“No one wants to depend on the Russian regime anymore. That’s it. This is completely clear even to (Russian dictator Vladimir) Putin.”

According to Klimkin, Russia wants to “create this chaos since they need to reboot Europe this winter” and “first of all, to take revenge.”

“If they don’t do it, they will understand very well that they’ve finally lost out completely against the West,” Klimkin said.

“That’s why these explosions began, and already direct threats with nuclear weapons. Russia perfectly understands the point of no return has really been passed. But I repeat once again: after these explosions, the West is no longer just supporting Ukraine in an allied sense, it’s already a part of this war, but not yet in a military sense.”

During a speech on the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions on Sept. 30, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin accused the “Anglo-Saxons” of causing the gas leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines.

The first report of an incident involving the Russia-Europe Nord Stream pipelines occurred on Sept. 26, when the pressure suddenly dropped in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. On Sept. 27, reports emerged of a similar issue with Nord Stream 1.

Both gas pipelines, passing along the bottom of the Baltic Sea off the coast of Sweden and Denmark, were not operational – but were still filled with technical gas for pressurization.

The pressure drop was recorded at a section of the pipeline located at a depth of about 70 meters near the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea – just outside the territorial waters of Denmark, but in its exclusive economic zone.

In total, three major leaks were recorded in the space of days. On Sept. 29, the Swedish Coast Guard reported a fourth gas leak.

Bjorn Lund, professor at the Swedish National Seismic Center SNSN, said that these explosions were obviously artificial, and not geological in nature.

According to the German media, the German government ruled out the accidental nature of the leaks and considered them deliberate sabotage. The Swedish and Danish authorities also called the leaks the result of “deliberate actions” and possible sabotage.

The German security services assume that both lines of the Nord Stream-1 pipeline, and one line of the Nord Stream-2 pipeline, will never be usable again after these explosions, writes German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sept. 29 that it was still too soon to speculate who might have been behind the Nord Stream pipeline ruptures.

According to CNN, European security officials on Sept. 26-27 observed Russian Navy support ships in the vicinity of leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines, which were likely caused by underwater explosions.

Ukrainian forces on Saturday entered a strategic eastern town after encircling Russian troops, challenging President Vladimir Putin’s claim to have annexed the area the day before. Russia’s defense minister confirmed its forces had pulled out “amid a threat of encirclement.”

Putin said Moscow was annexing four occupied Ukrainian regions “forever” and repeated warnings that he’d use all available means to defend the territories. The US and European Union members denounced the move. The US sanctioned hundreds of Russians, including central bank head Elvira Nabiullina and Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, a key figure in Russian dealings with OPEC.

Russian troops are pursuing attacks against Ukrainian-held areas in the east and south, including civilian housing and infrastructure, Ukraine’s military general staff said Saturday. Over the past 24 hours, Moscow’s forces staged missile, air and artillery strikes against military and civilian targets in dozens of settlements. Ukrainian forces struck Russian weapons complexes and military logistical sites, it said. A power station in the Odesa region and many residences in Mykolaiv were struck with “Iskander” and C-300 rockets Saturday morning, Interfax-Ukraine reported. Smoke billowing near the Belbek airfield in Sevastopol, Crimea, was caused by an aircraft overrunning the landing strip and catching fire, the occupied region’s governor said. Dramatic images of black smoke flooded social media.

Austin Says Retaking of Lyman Is Encouraging (11:30 p.m.)

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Ukrainian forces are creating “some really good effects” as they push to regain Russian-occupied territory, including the recapture of the strategic town of Lyman.

“We’re very encouraged by what we’re seeing right now,” Austin told reporters in Honolulu alongside Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles.

Marles said the war has the potential to turn into a “protracted conflict,” requiring support for Ukraine for an extended time. The “unprovoked aggression” by Russia “must not be allowed stand,” he said.

Australia imposed financial sanctions and travel bans on Russian-appointed officials in response to President Vladimir Putin’s self-declared annexation of parts of Ukraine. “The areas of Ukraine currently occupied by Russian forces are the sovereign territory of Ukraine,” Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a statement.

The measures will target 28 separatists, ministers and other officials, some of whom are flouting international law by seeking to legitimize Russia’s seizing of Ukrainian territory, according to the statement.

Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins’s party won parliamentary elections, an exit poll showed, knocking a political force backed by ethnic Russians from the top spot for the first time in more than a decade.

Bolstered by its opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Karins’s New Unity took 22.5% of Saturday’s vote, while the upstart United List party placed second at 11.5%, according to an exit poll for the Baltic nation’s public broadcasters. Karins has called on NATO to bolster its eastern flank, including Latvia’s 214-kilometer (132-mile) border with Russia.

Attack on Civilians in ‘Gray Area’ Killed 24, Ukraine Says (6 p.m.)

Russian forces attacked a civilian convoy in Kupyhansk district of the Kharkiv region on Sept. 25, shooting people in private cars, Security Service of Ukraine officials said Saturday.

Video from the scene, in the so-called “gray zone” between occupied Svavtov in Luhansk, and liberated Kharkiv, has just come to light. Russian hasn’t commented on the incident.

“Seven cars were shot, 24 people died, including 13 children and one pregnant woman,” Interfax-Ukraine reported.

Moscow’s Troops Out of Lyman in Battle Setback (5:25 p.m.)

Kyiv’s forces on Saturday recaptured Lyman, a strategic town in the country’s east, the second major victory in weeks and one that challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin’s claim to have annexed the area the day before.

The Russian defense ministry said its forces had “pulled out, amid a threat of encirclement, to more favorable positions.”

Retaking Lyman, which Russian troops occupied in May, restores Kyiv’s control over a key road and rail junction. It could pave the way for Ukraine’s military to push deeper toward cities such as Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in the neighboring Luhansk region.

Russia’s Gazprom Cuts Off Supplies of Gas to Italy (3:40 p.m.)

Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom PJSC suspended natural gas deliveries to Italy on Saturday, escalating the energy crisis in Europe.

“As of today Gazprom is no longer delivering gas to Eni,” said a spokesman for Eni SpA, Italy’s largest oil company.

Gazprom supplies Italy with gas through a pipeline that passes through Austria. The cutoff appeared to target just Italy, with Austria continuing to receive gas. Higher volumes of Russian gas were allocated to OMV than had been recently, a company spokesman said.

France is preparing to deliver as many as 12 new Caesar cannons to Ukraine’s force, the French daily reported on Saturday, without saying how it obtained the information. The weapons were initially destined to Denmark.

Technical talks are still ongoing, though an agreement in principle has been found between the French, Ukrainian and Danish governments.

An official at the French Ministry of Armed Forces declined to confirm the details of the report, beyond saying that France has supported Ukraine from the first days of Russia’s invasion. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke Saturday with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.

The Russian who rapped under the name “Walkie” killed himself rather than risk being drafted to fight in Ukraine, after recording an online video telling fans of his decision, according to Russian media reports on Saturday.

Ivan Petunin, 27, said he had an exemption to the call-up because of psychological problems but feared the authorities’ mobilization order would ultimately affect all draft-age men.

Ukraine’s foreign affairs ministry called on the international community -- including the United Nations and its nuclear agency, as well as the Group of Seven nations -- to help secure the release of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant director Ihor Murashov.

A Russian patrol seized Murashov on Friday afternoon and took him to an undisclosed location, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said in a Telegram post. Russian officials haven’t commented on the claim.

Poland plans to end simplified work permits for Russian citizens on the heels of its recent travel-visa ban, according to a draft law.

About 35,000 Russians used the simplified procedure last year, typically to take up seasonal jobs. Poland’s government says Russia’s invasion of requires stricter rules to avoid the risk of hybrid attacks by those allowed easy access to the country.

Russian Troops Said to be Encircled in Lyman (10:08 a.m.)

Some 5,000 Russian troops are said to be surrounded around Lyman as Kyiv’s forces push to recapture the strategic rail hub in Ukraine’s east, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said he’d annexed the region.

The Moscow-backed forces have no way of leaving the town beyond “trying to escape, die or surrender,” Luhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai said on Facebook. If Lyman is liberated, Ukraine’s army may press east toward Kreminna, he said. Five nearby settlements were liberated on Saturday, a military spokesman said.

“Ukraine is about to capture Lyman and it shows its military prowess again by humiliating the Russian army,” Mick Ryan, a defense analyst and retired Australian general, said on Twitter.

Moscow’s troops detained the head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as he was driving to the nearby city of Energodar, the Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom said in a Telegram post.

A Russian patrol seized Ihor Murashov, the plant’s director-general, on Friday afternoon, stopping his car and blindfolding him before taking him to an undisclosed location, according to the post. Russian officials haven’t commented on the claim.

Zaporizhzhia Strike Likely a ‘Long-Range Air Defense Missile,’ UK Says (8 a.m.)

Friday’s strike on a civilian convoy southeast of Zaporizhzhia “was likely a Russian long-range air defence missile being used in a ground attack role,” the UK defense ministry said.

“Russia’s stock of such missiles is highly likely limited and is a high-value resource designed to shoot down modern aircraft and incoming missiles,” the UK said. Moscow is “killing civilians it now claims are its own citizens.”

At least 25 people were killed in the strike, including two children, Ukrainian authorities said. The people were preparing to travel into occupied areas to rescue relatives or deliver aid.

Putin’s Funding Unscathed by Latest US Sanctions (8 a.m.)

The latest measures taken by the US to sanction Russian officials, their families, and others appear likely to have little practical effect on President Vladimir Putin’s ability to sustain his country’s economy with oil and gas revenue.

“To further isolate Russia, there needs to be a serious look at deploying secondary sanctions, rather than just threatening,” said Daniel Tannebaum, a former Treasury Department official. “Secondary sanctions force countries to choose between doing business with the target of sanctions, or those imposing sanctions.”

Adding Ukraine to NATO Is for a ‘Different Time’: US (9:33 p.m.)

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan reaffirmed the Biden administration’s position that Ukraine’s request to join NATO should be considered “at a different time.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier Friday that his country would make an accelerated bid to join the alliance after Russia formally annexed areas of Ukraine. “The best way for us to support Ukraine is through practical, on-the-ground support in Ukraine and that the process in Brussels should be taken up at a different time,” Sullivan said in response.

1065602286,20221001,"Meet the young people from a unionist background who support a united Ireland.

Andrew Clarke, 26, and Peter Adair, 21, grew up with religious and cultural influences associated with a British identity.

But the pair are joining a major nationalist conference being held in Dublin on Saturday to rally support for Irish unity, Belfast Live reports.

Thousands of people are expected to attend the 'Together We Can' event in the 3Arena staged by campaign group Ireland's Future.

Politicians including Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, and actors James Nesbitt and Colm Meaney, are among those scheduled to speak at the conference.

Mr Clarke and Mr Adair, who are set to feature in a video at the event, spoke to Belfast Live about how their nationalist views have developed over time.

The pair both attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution grammar school in the city centre but did not know each other before becoming involved in Ireland's Future.

Both are final-year history students, with Mr Clarke studying at Queen's University Belfast and Mr Adair attending Oxford University.

Mr Clarke said his family is from a Protestant background in East Belfast. When he was younger he attended Twelfth of July parades and Eleventh Night bonfires.

He said the ""eye-opener"" in his thinking was the Union flag protests in 2012 over a council decision to no longer fly the flag from Belfast City Hall all year round.

He said it ""all just seemed bizarre"", adding: ""It shocked me hard enough that it made me question everything.""

Mr Clarke, who was a teenager in school at the time, said: ""I remember we were sitting in English planning, 'Are we going into town for the riots tonight?' From that I kind of debated, 'What am I doing here?'""

Mr Adair, from South Belfast, is the youngest of three boys. His parents are both accountants and growing up he would have attended Fitzroy Presbyterian Church, where his mother is an elder.

He described himself as being from a ""culturally unionist"" background but he ""wouldn't have thought about it"".

""I would say Brexit was definitely the turning point. I definitely would not be in favour of Brexit. For the UK as a whole I don't think it's a good idea but I think it's quite damaging for Northern Ireland,"" he said.

""It has made me question the Union itself because the majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain and I don't see how Brexit can have a good outcome in Northern Ireland.""

He said that when the UK was part of the European Union, people's national identity in Northern Ireland could be more ""fluid"".

""You could be British or Irish or Northern Irish. But since Brexit it has made it more difficult to have that fluid identity,"" he said.

Mr Adair also said he did not feel unionist parties represent his views, citing as examples his support for same-sex marriage and pro-choice position on abortion.

The student, who earlier this year joined the SDLP, said: ""People like (TUV leader) Jim Allister and (DUP leader) Jeffrey Donaldson, I wouldn't say their views are that of most young people by any means.

""I definitely feel they cater for a more older, conservative population in Northern Ireland.""

Mr Clarke shares stories from Irish history on his Instagram account Tanistry, which has amassed almost 30,000 followers.

He said his views have ""moved steadily along to different points in the political spectrum"" over the years and he would now consider himself an Irish republican.

""I would like to see a united Ireland. I have no interest in 'the Republic of Ireland plus the north east'. That doesn't interest me,"" he said.

Mr Adair said: ""I would call myself a moderate nationalist, in that I don't think a border poll should happen tomorrow, but we definitely need to be discussing what a united Ireland would look like.""

He said that in the Census last year he recorded his national identity as 'Northern Irish'' but since then he would consider himself 'Northern Irish' and 'Irish'.

""To be honest I think, studying in England, I wouldn't say I have the same identity of the people who I study with, who are mostly English. So when I meet people I introduce myself as Irish,"" he said.

Mr Adair responded: ""I would say your background doesn't need to determine your views.""

Mr Clarke said: ""I think the message I kind of put out is it's a lot easier than people think to find a voice outside of where you come from.

""I think that being wrong is the fastest way of being right.""

1065603965,20221001,"BERLIN — Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is suing a senior German lawmaker who called him a “sewer rat,” his lawyer said Friday.

Mustafa Kaplan confirmed a report by German weekly Der Spiegel that he had filed a criminal complaint for slander and libel against lawmaker Wolfgang Kubicki on behalf of his client.

Kubicki, a member of the governing Free Democratic Party, told German news agency dpa that he was unconcerned about the lawsuit.

The Turkish government this week sharply criticized Kubicki's comments, made at a recent election campaign event.

Kubicki used the term “sewer rat” in reference to Erdogan while talking about a migration deal between Turkey and the European Union.

The lawmaker later said he considered sewer rats to be “small, cute, but also clever and devious creatures” that sometimes appear as protagonists in children's stories.

Erdogan previously won a case in Germany forbidding a comedian from repeating parts of a crude poem he wrote about the Turkish president."

• This was the second coup in the country in 10 months.
• The seizure of power was condemned by the Economic Community of West African States.

Burkina Faso awoke to fresh uncertainty on Saturday after its second coup this year when junior officers toppled a junta leader, saying he had failed to fight jihadist attacks in the deeply poor and restive West African nation.

An uneasy calm permeated through the capital Ouagadougou where soldiers in armoured vehicles and pickup trucks guarded the national television centre, but traffic slowly resumed on arterial roads.

Shops started reopening in the dusty and spread-out city, where pre-dawn gunfire on Friday around the presidential palace culminated in the latest coup that drew wide condemnation.

The Economic Community of West African States regional bloc ""condemned in the strongest possible terms"" the latest seizure of power, calling it ""inappropriate"" at a time when progress was being made for a return to constitutional order by 1 July 2024.

Burkina Faso's former colonial ruler, France, told its citizens in Ouagadougou, believed to be between 4 000 and 5 000, to stay home, while the European Union expressed ""concern"" at the unfolding events.

The United States called ""for a return to calm and restraint by all actors"".

Just before 8:00 on Friday, more than a dozen soldiers in fatigues appeared on the state television and radio broadcaster to announce the removal of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba.

""We have decided to take our responsibilities, driven by a single ideal: the restoration of security and integrity of our territory,"" they said.

With much of the Sahel region battling a growing Islamist insurgency, the violence has prompted a series of coups in Mali, Guinea and Chad since 2020.

In January, Damiba installed himself as leader of the country of 16 million after accusing elected president Roch Marc Christian Kabore of failing to beat back the jihadists.

But with more than 40% of the country outside government control, the latest putsch leaders said Damiba, too, had failed.



""Far from liberating the occupied territories, the once-peaceful areas have come under terrorist control,"" the new military leaders said.

They then suspended the constitution, sealed the borders, dissolved the transitional government and legislative assembly and instituted a 21:00 to 5:00 curfew.

New strongman Traore was previously head of anti-jihadist special forces unit ""Cobra"" in the northern region of Kaya.

Damiba's Patriotic Movement for Preservation and Restoration (MPSR) said earlier on Friday that there was an ""internal crisis in the army"" prompting troop deployments in key areas of the capital.

Government spokesman Lionel Bilgo said the ""crisis"" concerned an army pay dispute, and that Damiba was taking part in negotiations.

In the morning, shots rang out in the Ouaga 2000 neighbourhood, which houses both the presidential and junta headquarters.

State television was cut for several hours prior to the military announcement, broadcasting just a blank screen with the message ""no video signal"".

Though Damiba had promised to make security his priority when he took charge on 24 January, violent attacks have increased since March.

In the north and east, towns have been blockaded by insurgents who have blown up bridges and attacked supply convoys.

As in bordering countries, insurgents affiliated with Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group have stoked unrest.

Thousands have died and about two million have been displaced by the fighting since 2015 when the insurgency spread to Burkina Faso, which has since become the epicentre of the violence across the Sahel.

In September, a particularly bloody month, Damiba sacked his defence minister and assumed the role himself.

Earlier this week, suspected jihadists attacked a convoy carrying supplies to the town of Djibo in the north of the country. The government said 11 soldiers died and around 50 civilians were missing."

Through their brave protests, the Iranian people are sending a message to the world: the Islamic Republic is repressive and unreformable. Its fearsome security services are the beating heart of the Iranian establishment. Long overdue were the recent U.S. sanctions on the regime’s Morality Police force, which harasses and detains women for purported immodest dress, and in whose custody twenty-two-year-old Mahsa Amini died on September 16. 

But that entity cannot be viewed apart from Iran’s broader command-and-control structure, headed by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Ebrahim Raisi. That’s why America should not lift any sanctions on those two officials in order to revive the Iran nuclear deal. Quite the opposite: the U.S. and European Union need to impose new sanctions on Khamenei and Raisi for abusing the human rights of Iranians. 

Sanctions Need to Hold, and Increase 

The Biden administration sanctioned the Morality Police last week under Executive Order (E.O.) 13553, which then-President Barack Obama issued in 2010. The E.O. authorized freezing property and banning visas for Iranian government officials, or their agents, “responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses” against Iranians, people in Iran, or the families thereof.

Iran’s Police Complex Structure 

The Morality Police reports to the Islamic Republic’s Law Enforcement Forces (LEF), itself sanctioned under E.O. 13553. The LEF, in turn, is technically affiliated with the Interior Ministry, whose head is nominated by the president only after being preapproved by Khamenei. However, in practice, the supreme leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have primary influence over the police enterprise. Further, Khamenei retains approval power over the appointments of the senior brass of the LEF, including its commander—traditionally an IRGC officer—and deputy commander. Likewise, the interior minister chairs the National Domestic Security Council (NDSC)—and holds a seat on the Raisi-chaired Supreme National Security Council (SNSC)—which has executed crackdowns on protests. The SNSC answers only to the supreme leader.

This is why Iranians marching throughout the country are chanting “Death to Khamenei” and “Death to the Dictator.” They know who their ultimate oppressors are—the men giving the orders. 

Biden Administration Still May Lift Sanctions

And this is why lifting existing U.S. sanctions on Khamenei and Raisi—as reports claim the Biden administration might do as part of a return to the nuclear deal—would be a very negative signal to the Iranian people. The regime is reportedly insisting on the rescinding of E.O. 13876, which authorizes sanctions on the supreme leader’s office and appointees. Some of the most repressive regime figures are sanctioned under that order, including Khamenei, his son Mojtaba, and Raisi. And 13876 is a non-nuclear executive order—nowhere in its text is Iran’s nuclear program even mentioned. 

Instead of rescinding 13876, Washington should go even further and sanction Khamenei and Raisi under E.O. 13553 for human rights abuses in addition. Both men should have been sanctioned accordingly years ago, well before Mahsa Amini’s death. 

For example, amid gas protests in 2019, Khamenei reportedly told security officials, “The Islamic Republic is in danger. Do whatever it takes to end it. You have my order.” The regime proceeded to kill as many as 1,500 Iranians. Khamenei could be giving similar directions to suppress the current demonstrations. 

In fact, for years, Khamenei’s direct subordinates in his office have been sanctioned under E.O. 13553. One is Asghar Mir Hejazi, his intelligence and security advisor, who is likely part of the deliberations regarding responding to the protests. Also in this power center is Mojtaba Khamenei, who liaises with the IRGC and its Basij paramilitary force, both of which form the core of Iran’s multilayered domestic security network and are deployed as necessary to reinforce the police. But Mojtaba, like his father, is only sanctioned under E.O. 13876 and not 13553, despite being implicated in grave human rights violations. It’s time to correct that as well. Iranians have been chanting against Mojtaba in the ongoing protests, saying, “Mojtaba, may you die and not become supreme leader.” 

Raisi also merits these same penalties. As first deputy chief justice in 2009, he personally “was involved in the regime’s brutal crackdown” on the Green Movement protests, the U.S. government said. Later, Raisi served as chief justice and a standing member of the SNSC when it coordinated the organized brutality against Iranian citizens during the 2019 gas protests. And now he is signaling that the regime will violently suppress the ongoing marches, saying Iran must “deal decisively with those who oppose the country’s security and tranquility.” 

European leaders should undertake similar targeted sanctions. Since 2013, the EU has levied only two rounds of sanctions on Iran’s security dragnet, undercutting the EU’s stated commitment to human rights. In 2019, it sanctioned Iran’s Intelligence Ministry following an attempted bomb plot in France. Then, in 2021, the EU belatedly applied human rights sanctions to Iranian officials following the state-sanctioned violence against the 2019 protesters. Those designated included the heads of the IRGC, Basij, and LEF—all of whom ultimately report to the supreme leader, whom the EU should therefore sanction as well. The Europeans should list Raisi, too, given that he served on the SNSC during this timeframe, that the EU has sanctioned past chief justices like Sadegh Larijani, and that Raisi’s own role as president places him in a position to crack down on demonstrations through the SNSC. 

As Iranians risk their lives seeking freedom, America and the EU must stand with them. Standing with Iranians means punishing the Islamic Republic—from Khamenei and Raisi down—for human rights abuses, instead of rewarding it with sanctions relief to resuscitate the nuclear deal. It means listening to the demands of the Iranian people, not the demands of their oppressors at the negotiating table.

“But in fact, the question is very simple: who benefits from this? Today, it’s beneficial only to the Russian regime.”

According to Klimkin, this is because Russia has realized that it has lost the energy war against Europe.

“And they want to put (an end to the business) right now and say there will be no gas now,” he said.

“After that, they will (attempt to) rock Europe in such a way as to reboot the entire political elite – no more, no less. This is also perfectly clear to the European Union today.”

Klimkin said Russia had already accepted that it would no longer be selling its gas in the European Union.

“Even the Germans are going to Canada, Qatar, and the Emirates and sign contracts for the supply of liquefied gas,” Klimkin said..

“No one wants to depend on the Russian regime anymore. That’s it. This is completely clear even to (Russian dictator Vladimir) Putin.”

According to Klimkin, Russia wants to “create this chaos since they need to reboot Europe this winter” and “first of all, to take revenge.”

“If they don’t do it, they will understand very well that they’ve finally lost out completely against the West,” Klimkin said.

“That’s why these explosions began, and already direct threats with nuclear weapons. Russia perfectly understands the point of no return has really been passed. But I repeat once again: after these explosions, the West is no longer just supporting Ukraine in an allied sense, it’s already a part of this war, but not yet in a military sense.”

During a speech on the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions on Sept. 30, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin accused the “Anglo-Saxons” of causing the gas leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines.

The first report of an incident involving the Russia-Europe Nord Stream pipelines occurred on Sept. 26, when the pressure suddenly dropped in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. On Sept. 27, reports emerged of a similar issue with Nord Stream 1.

Both gas pipelines, passing along the bottom of the Baltic Sea off the coast of Sweden and Denmark, were not operational – but were still filled with technical gas for pressurization.

The pressure drop was recorded at a section of the pipeline located at a depth of about 70 meters near the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea – just outside the territorial waters of Denmark, but in its exclusive economic zone.

In total, three major leaks were recorded in the space of days. On Sept. 29, the Swedish Coast Guard reported a fourth gas leak.

Bjorn Lund, professor at the Swedish National Seismic Center SNSN, said that these explosions were obviously artificial, and not geological in nature.

According to the German media, the German government ruled out the accidental nature of the leaks and considered them deliberate sabotage. The Swedish and Danish authorities also called the leaks the result of “deliberate actions” and possible sabotage.

The German security services assume that both lines of the Nord Stream-1 pipeline, and one line of the Nord Stream-2 pipeline, will never be usable again after these explosions, writes German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sept. 29 that it was still too soon to speculate who might have been behind the Nord Stream pipeline ruptures.

According to CNN, European security officials on Sept. 26-27 observed Russian Navy support ships in the vicinity of leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines, which were likely caused by underwater explosions.

1065617610,20221001,"A military vehicle is seen in front of Burkina Faso national television in Ouagadougou on October 1, 2022.

Burkina Faso awoke to fresh chaos Saturday with the country facing its second coup in a year. Junta leader Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba was toppled by junior officers led by Captain Ibrahim Traore, who accused Damiba of failing to address the numerous jihadist attacks on the impoverished and restive West African nation.

Angry protesters attacked the French Embassy in Burkina Faso's capital Saturday after supporters of the West African nation's new coup leader accused France of harboring the ousted interim president, a charge French authorities vehemently denied.

Lt. Col. Paul Henri Sandaogo Damiba was overthrown late Friday less than nine months after he’d mounted a coup himself in Burkina Faso, which has been failing to effectively counter rising violence by Islamic extremists.

Comments by a junta spokesman earlier Saturday set into motion an outburst of anger in Ouagadougou, the capital.

“Damiba has tried to retreat to the Kamboinsin French military base to prepare a counteroffensive in order to sow divide amongst our defense and security forces,” said Lt. Jean Baptiste Kabre, reading a statement on behalf of the new junta leadership.

Video on social media showed residents with lit torches outside the perimeter of the French embassy and other images showed part of the compound ablaze.

In Burkina Faso’s second-largest city, Bobo-Dioulasso, angry crowds also vandalized the French institute.

Damiba's whereabouts remained unknown but France’s Foreign Ministry issued a strongly worded statement: “We formally deny involvement in the events unfolding in Burkina Faso. The camp where the French forces are based has never hosted Paul Henri Sandaogo Damiba nor has our embassy.”

French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre later told FRANCE 24 Saturday night that it was a “confusing situation” in Ouagadougou and she urged French citizens to stay at home.

Traore, the 34-year-old army captain who was named in charge after the Friday evening coup was announced on state television, said in interviews that he and his men did not seek to harm Damiba, who unlike other deposed leaders in the region has yet to give a resignation.

“If we wanted, we would take him within five minutes of fighting and maybe he would be dead, the president. But we don’t want this catastrophe,” Traore told the Voice of America. “We don’t want to harm him, because we don’t have any personal problem with him. We’re fighting for Burkina Faso.”

He later told Radio Omega: “We have no intention to bring Damiba to justice. We only wish that he would go rest because he is tired, and as for us we are going to continue to do the work.”

As uncertainty prevailed, the international community widely condemned the ouster of Damiba, who himself overthrew the country’s democratically elected president in January.

U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Saturday that the United States “is deeply concerned by events in Burkina Faso.”

“We call on those responsible to de-escalate the situation, prevent harm to citizens and soldiers, and return to a constitutional order,” he said.

The African Union and the West African region bloc known as ECOWAS also sharply criticized the developments.

“ECOWAS finds this new power grab inappropriate at a time when progress has been made,” the bloc said, citing Damiba's recent agreement to return to constitutional order by July 2024.

After taking power in January, Damiba promised to end the Islamic extremist violence that has forced 2 million people to flee their homes in Burkina Faso. But the group of officers led by Traore said Friday that Damiba had failed and was being removed.

The new junta leadership said it would commit “all fighting forces to refocus on the security issue and the restoration of the integrity of our territory.”

But it remains to be seen whether the junta can turn around the crisis. Concerns already were mounting Saturday that the latest political volatility would further distract the military and allow the jihadis to strengthen their grip on the once-peaceful country.

Still, to some in Burkina Faso's military, Damiba was seen as too cozy with former colonizer France, which maintains a military presence in Africa's Sahel region to help countries fight Islamic extremists. Some who support the new coup leader, Traore, have called on Burkina Faso's government to seek Russian support instead.

“One point of contention that has divided the MPSR (junta), the army and indeed the population for months is the choice of international partners,"" said Constantin Gouvy, Burkina Faso researcher at Clingendael, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations.

“Damiba was leaning toward France, but we might see the MPSR more actively exploring alternatives from now on, with Turkey or Russia for example,"" Gouvy added.

In neighboring Mali, the coup leader has invited Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group to help with security, a move than has drawn global condemnation and accusations of human rights abuses.

Mali also saw a second coup nine months after the August 2020 overthrow of its president, when the junta’s leader sidelined his civilian transition counterparts and put himself alone in charge.

Chrysogone Zougmore, president of the Burkina Faso Movement for Human Rights, called the latest overthrow “very regrettable,” saying the political instability would not help in the fight against Islamic extremist violence.

“How can we hope to unite people and the army if the latter is characterized by such serious divisions?” Zougmore said."

The coup ""puts in danger efforts to supervise a transition, undertaken for several months, notably on the part of the ECOWAS"" regional grouping, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement.

The bloc called for authorities to respect agreements undertaken on July 3 ""in order to accompany Burkina Faso to a return to constitutional order no later than July 1, 2024"".

1065624465,20221001,"The United Nations took a cautious stance after the nearly one-and-a-half crore fake voters and the BNP’s election conspiracy came to light. On January 22, 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon vowed to cancel all technical assistance for the BNP-Jamaat monopoly elections. They also closed the office in Dhaka to observe the election. The European Union also announced not to monitor this rigged election.

The Prothom Alo published the report on January 12, 2007, citing United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the European Union Commissioner for External Relations Dr Benita Ferrero Waldner. In addition, UN Resident Representative in Dhaka, Renata Lock issued a statement raising the question of deploying the army in the elections on January 22 and warning that Bangladesh's military role in UN peacekeeping missions might be affected.

Earlier, BNP-backed president Iajuddin Ahmed had illegally occupied the post of chief adviser to the caretaker government at the behest of Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman. He bypassed the Election Commissioner, unconstitutionally reshuffled the secretaries and changed the returning officers. According to the constitution, no one else has the authority to do these things except the Election Commission after the announcement of the election schedule.

Also, according to Tarique Rahman’s advice and Iajuddin’s orders, the police spread panic through mass arrests of Awami League supporters across the country. Moreover, one crore and 23 lakh fake voters were created to ensure the victory of BNP-Jamaat. But as it was exposed, the international community opposed this rigged and violent election. President Iajuddin Ahmed was forced to resign from the post of chief adviser on January 11.

In the meantime, Awami League and other parties voiced their demand for a voter list with pictures and fair voting in transparent ballot boxes. As a result, President Iajuddin made a statement admitting the issue of fake voters amid public pressure and the leak of the conspiracy before the international community. He said free and fair elections were not possible within 90 days with fake voters."
1065624466,20221001,"Although carbon dioxide is the primary culprit for global warming, methane also packs quite the punch. It’s the second-most emitted greenhouse gas, and ton for ton, CH has a warming potential some 30 times that of CO on century time scales.

At the 26th Conference of the Parties meeting on climate change in Glasgow, UK, in November 2021, the US, European Union, and 11 other countries announced a Global Methane Pledge. The 121 participants have agreed to collectively reduce CH emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Those reductions would come from all CH sources and would reduce the global temperature rise by 0.2 °C by 2050. But some of the largest fossil-fuel emitters, including China, India, and Russia, haven’t joined the pledge.

Methane is emitted from oil and gas wells, agricultural activity, natural biological processes, and other sources. Emissions from the oil and gas industry are easier to detect and control than those from other sources because they come from well-defined locations. Some one-third of anthropogenic CH emissions come from the production and transport of fossil fuels.

A May 2022 report from the American Physical Society (APS) and Optica explored how best to reduce CH emissions in the oil and gas industry. Researchers have started to develop and demonstrate the CH detection and pipe-repair technologies necessary to hit the emissions-reductions targets specified by the United Nations (UN).

Methane remains in the air for about a decade, unlike the hundreds or thousands of years that CO lingers. The short lifetime of atmospheric CH paired with its high warming potential means that any emissions reductions of CH will have an outsize effect on air temperatures. In recent years, however, global CH emissions have been rising by 0.5% per year, according to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “We need to prioritize methane…. If you manage to decrease emissions, you’ll see the effect in a decade,” says William Collins, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who was a lead author for the intergovernmental panel’s last three reports and cochair of the committee that wrote the APS–Optica report. emissions come from the oil and gas sector. The APS–Optica report ( emissions in that region. Similar CH super emitters exist in Algeria, Iran, Kazakhstan, and Russia, according to a 2022 paper coauthored by Thomas Lauvaux of France’s Laboratory for Sciences of Climate and Environment. Globally, 30% of CHemissions come from the oil and gas sector. The APS–Optica report ( https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.464421 ) concludes that more than half of those emissions come from leaks or deliberate releases, predominantly from up to a tenth of the oil and gas wells in operation. Targeted policies that focus on that handful of locations could substantially reduce emissions. A 2015 study by Steven Hamburg of the Environmental Defense Fund and colleagues, for example, found that at any given time, 2% of the oil facilities in the Barnett Shale oil and gas field in Texas were responsible for half of the CHemissions in that region. Similar CHsuper emitters exist in Algeria, Iran, Kazakhstan, and Russia, according to a 2022 paper coauthored by Thomas Lauvaux of France’s Laboratory for Sciences of Climate and Environment. The search for CH emissions and leaks occurs on three spatial scales. At the ground level, technicians may inspect individual pipes or specific locations at an oil well to pinpoint small leaks or deliberate releases. But that’s unrealistic for monitoring thousands of wells and millions of kilometers of pipeline. Remote methods use spectrometers to monitor the IR wavelengths that CH absorbs. The characteristic spectral lines can be used to identify and quantify CH leaks. The active-sensing approaches on low-flying airplanes use onboard light sources to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of CH measurements. Those aircraft can detect small CH leaks, with a discharge rate as low as 1 kg/h. The largest leaks—those that spew more than 30 kg/h—contribute 60–80% of the CH emissions from oil and gas production and are detectable with satellites. Satellite detection relies on passive radiation from the Sun to record the spectrum of atmospheric CH . Although satellite and airplane methods can scan far larger areas than ground-based approaches, they may miss intermittent leaks. The APS–Optica report calls for a cohesive, multiscale system for monitoring CH from the oil and gas industry: Measurements would be collected continuously, and the data would ideally be freely available so that outside parties could ensure that companies are complying with regulations. In support of that vision, the US Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management announced in August that it will award $32 million toward developing such a monitoring system.

Methane may have only five atoms, but the four carbon–hydrogen bonds add many degrees of freedom in which the molecule can vibrate. The many molecular motions translate to various rotation–vibration states, which can be excited when a molecule absorbs IR light. To obtain a meaningful CH observation in the field, researchers typically compare spectral measurements with known absorption features of the molecule for which temperature, pressure, and other properties are carefully controlled in a lab setting. One of the APS–Optica report’s coauthors, Michelle Bailey, works as a research chemist in the optical measurements group at NIST. She and her colleagues measure the spectral features of well-characterized CH and other gas samples with ultrasensitive techniques offering high spectral resolution. The intrinsic physical parameters that Bailey and her collaborators—and other groups worldwide—collect are used to benchmark theoretical models. The data and models are disseminated in an open-access database called HITRAN; scientists can then use the data to simulate the behavior of atmospheric CH . But clouds, aerosols, atmospheric mixing, and other environmental conditions complicate field measurements and their comparisons with theoretical CH spectra. “As you increase your path length from near surface to the upper atmosphere, the instrument is subjected to a number of potential interferences,” explains Bailey. Nearby non-point-source emissions, particularly agricultural ones, are another challenge to collecting meaningful measurements of CH emissions from oil and gas point sources. Isotope fingerprinting may help. Methane produced from an agricultural source, for example, contains a different mixture of carbon isotopes than CH from an oil and gas source. The difference in molecular mass affects the frequencies of absorbed light, so IR optical-sensing methods can distinguish CH sources.

In addition to detection improvements, researchers have also been developing technologies to quickly and autonomously repair leaks from oil and gas operations. DOE launched its Methane Mitigation Technologies program in 2016 with the goal of eliminating emissions from the oil and gas supply chain by 2030. The program’s priority is to develop technologies that could later be commercialized. For example, the DOE collaborated with the Southwest Research Institute to repurpose a fixed-laser sensor to scan for CH leaks at wells. The upgraded sensor is mounted on a drone to autonomously estimate emissions. A research manager of the program interviewed for this story said that a lot of R&D has focused on repair technologies for the over 3 million kilometers of pipeline that crisscross the US. In collaboration with Oceanit Laboratories, headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, the DOE program has supported the development of DragX—a friction-reducing, corrosion-resistant, and nontoxic coating that could be applied to existing pipelines. The 100-micron-thick film can reduce surface roughness by some 50% and improve the pipeline’s durability. Many of the coating’s technical details are confidential, although preliminary analysis indicates it can last for years. The DOE program is also supporting the development of robotic repair devices with ULC Technologies in New York. They’re designed to travel the length of a pipeline and measure localized pressure changes, which are used as a proxy for material defects. If such a defect is found, the robot magnetically applies a temporary patch, which technicians later replace with a permanent one during a routine evacuation of the pipeline section. Although many prototype technologies have been evaluated in laboratory settings and have seen success in limited field testing, they may not ultimately be deployed by oil and gas companies. “We do systems analysis to consistently evaluate technical feasibility and cost effectiveness but we don’t pick winners,” says the DOE program manager for methane-mitigation technologies. “You can’t force commercialization on industry, and most all technologies will commercialize as a function of market forces.”

Besides emissions from undetected or unrepaired leaks, oil and gas companies routinely emit CH intentionally. Oil extracted from below the surface often contains CH , sometimes referred to as associated natural gas. Even though CH has several uses—either as fuel or as a chemical feedstock in various industrial processes—a pipeline may not be available to transport the gas to a refinery or chemical-processing facility. Instead, in a process known as flaring, companies burn CH and other unwanted by-products associated with oil extraction. The practice is responsible for up to 20% of the total CH emissions from oil and gas operations, according to the APS–Optica report. To limit flaring, governments, companies, and other stakeholders are exploring economically viable alternatives. Some flares are large enough to be observed from space by satellites. Oil producers can also self-report them. But the two data sources are often inconsistent. Discrepancies, the APS–Optica report concludes, arise from incomplete monitoring. Many states do not require producers to report flaring activity to regulators, and independent satellite-measured flaring is episodic. Only a few observations can be made per month at a given location because of satellites’ orbits. To limit and eventually stop the practice of routine flaring globally, the World Bank has set up the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, made up of governments, oil and gas companies, and nongovernmental organizations. The partnership launched the Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative in 2015. Signatories make a nonbinding pledge to not flare in any newly developed oil fields and to commit to ending routine flaring in legacy locations by 2030. During the oil-extraction process, the pressure in a well can vary dramatically, and a sudden pressurization can cause an explosion. Gas flaring in those nonroutine situations and in response to immediate safety concerns is excluded by the initiative. Some 34 governments—including Iraq, Nigeria, Russia, and the US, which are among the top flaring countries—and more than 50 oil companies, including BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, SaudiAramco, Shell, and TotalEnergies, have signed on to the initiative. A 2018 study by the World Bank estimated that the total cost to end routine flaring by 2030 would be at least $100 billion. A May 2022 press release from the World Bank said that “2021 showed disappointing progress” toward meeting the 2030 target. Among the contributions to the sticker price are the costs of separating CH from other hydrocarbons and transporting it to energy markets, where it can displace coal and other more-polluting fuels. Zubin Bamji, the program manager of the World Bank partnership, says financing comes from various sources, including project developers, equipment suppliers, strategic investment funds, commercial banks, and private capital funds. Investing in pricey infrastructure has its own business risks, especially given the strain on energy supplies because of the war in Ukraine. Still, says Bamji, “governments and companies remain committed to zero routine flaring by 2030, and some have even more ambitious targets. We can’t lose sight of the need to decarbonize global energy supplies.” Bamji also cites an encouraging statistic: Although the past 26 years have seen a 20% increase in oil production, associated gas flaring has fallen by 13% in that time."
1065625284,20211001,"HELSINKI (AP) — Latvia held a general election Saturday amid divisions over Russia's attack on Ukraine among the Baltic country’s sizable ethnic-Russian minority. An exit poll predicted that the center-right will win the most votes but whoever forms the next government will face huge war-induced energy concerns.

A joint exit poll forecast that center-right New Unity party of Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins would win the election, capturing 22.5% of the vote. The poll was done by the Riga Stradins University, the SKDSA research center. the LETA newswire, Latvian Television and Latvian Radio.

The poll also predicted that a new centrist party that favors green development — United List — would be second with 11.5% of the vote and the opposition Greens and Farmers Union would come in third with 10.9% support. Only eight parties are predicted to pass the 5% barrier and secure representation at the 100-seat Saeima legislature.

A total of 19 parties had over 1,800 candidates running in the election. Official results are expected Sunday morning.

Initial voter turnout was 59%, the Central Election Committee said, an increase from 54.5% in the 2018 election.

Karins, who became head of Latvia's government in January 2019, currently leads a four-party minority coalition that along with New Unity includes the center-right National Alliance, the centrist Development/For!, and the Conservatives.

Karins, a 57-year-old dual Latvian-U.S. citizen born in Wilmington, Delaware, told Latvian media that it would be easiest to continue with the same coalition government if New Unity wins. He has excluded any cooperation with pro-Kremlin parties.

Support for parties catering to Latvia's ethnic-Russian minority, who make up over 25% of Latvia's 1.9 million people, is expected to be mixed; some loyal voters have abandoned them since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

This election is likely to be the death knell for the opposition Harmony party, whose popularity has steadily declined. The Moscow-friendly party traditionally served as an umbrella for most of Latvia’s Russian-speaking voters, including Belarusians and Ukrainians. In the 2018 election, Harmony received almost 20% of the vote, the most of any single party, but was excluded by other parties from entering the government.

However, Harmony's immediate and staunch opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused many voters who still back Russian President Vladimir Putin to desert it. Those opposed to the war, meanwhile, tended to move toward Latvia’s mainstream parties, who condemned the invasion.

A recent poll by Latvian public broadcaster LSM showed Harmony trailing in fifth place with 5.1% support.

“I think the Russophonic part of the population is very fragmented,” Pauls Raudseps, a columnist at the Latvian news magazine IR, told The Associated Press. “You can’t say it’s unified on anything. Some part is pro-Putin. But what we’ve seen is that the war in general has changed attitudes. And it has happened fairly rapidly.”

Long lines were reported outside polling stations in several places Saturday, including the capital, Riga. Many voters said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine affected their attitudes.

“People are getting more active, and as you see, there is a queue already. So, hopefully some of the pro-Russians have switched to the more European parties now,” IT engineer Ratios Shovels, 38, said at a Riga district polling place.

Elena Dadukina, a 43-year-old lawyer said, said she wasn't sure if the healthy turnout was ""due to the war or whether people want greater responsibility in choosing their candidates because of how they will influence our domestic politics.”

Since Russia's war on Ukraine started in February, Latvian officials have banned Russians from entering the country with tourist visas and dismantled a prominent Soviet monument in Riga.

This week, the Latvian government announced a state of emergency at certain border areas as a precaution following Russia’s partial military mobilization. Like Baltic neighbors Estonia and Lithuania, Latvia is refusing to grant political asylum to Russian military reservists escaping conscription.

Latvia, which joined the European Union and NATO in 2004, also plans to reintroduce military conscription next year after a hiatus of over 15 years.

• The AU has condemned the ""unconstitutional change of government"" in Burkina Faso.
• They alleged that the leader had failed to fight jihadist attacks in the west African country.

The African Union on Saturday condemned the ""unconstitutional change of government"" in Burkina Faso, a day after the second coup this year in the deeply poor and restive West African country.

Junior officers toppled a junta leader on Friday, saying he had failed to fight jihadist attacks in the country.

""The chairperson calls upon the military to immediately and totally refrain from any acts of violence or threats to the civilian population, civil liberties, human rights,"" the AU said in a statement, calling for the restoration of the constitutional order by July 2024.

AU chief Moussa Faki Mahamat said he was deeply concerned about the resurgence of unconstitutional ousters in the West African nation and elsewhere on the continent.

In Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, an uneasy calm reigned as soldiers in armoured vehicles and pickup trucks guarded the national television centre but traffic slowly resumed on arterial roads.

Shops slowly started reopening in the dusty and spread-out city, where pre-dawn gunfire on Friday around the presidential palace culminated in the latest coup, that drew wide condemnation.

The Economic Community of West African States regional bloc ""condemned in the strongest possible terms"" the latest seizure of power, calling it ""inappropriate"" at a time when progress was being made for a return to constitutional order by 1 July 2024.

Burkina Faso's former colonial ruler France told its citizens in Ouagadougou, believed to number between 4 000 and 5 000, to stay home, while the European Union expressed ""concern"" at the unfolding events.

The United States called ""for a return to calm and restraint by all actors"".

Just before 20:00 on Friday, more than a dozen soldiers in fatigues appeared on the state television and radio broadcaster to announce the removal of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba.

""We have decided to take our responsibilities, driven by a single ideal: the restoration of security and integrity of our territory,"" they said.

""Damiba failed. Since he came to power, the zones that were peaceful were attacked. He took power but then he betrayed us,"" Habibata Rouamba, a trader and activist said on Saturday.

With much of the Sahel region battling a growing Islamist insurgency, the violence has prompted a series of coups in Mali, Guinea and Chad since 2020.

In January, Damiba installed himself as leader of the country of 16 million after accusing elected president Roch Marc Christian Kabore of failing to beat back the jihadists.

But with more than 40 percent of the country outside government control, the latest putsch leaders said Damiba, too, had failed.



""Far from liberating the occupied territories, the once-peaceful areas have come under terrorist control,"" the new military leaders said.

They then suspended the constitution, sealed the borders, dissolved the transitional government and legislative assembly and instituted a 21:00 to 05:00 curfew.

New strongman Traore was previously head of anti-jihadist special forces unit ""Cobra"" in the northern region of Kaya.

In the morning, shots rang out in the Ouaga 2000 neighbourhood, which houses both the presidential and junta headquarters.

State television was cut for several hours prior to the military announcement, broadcasting just a blank screen with the message ""no video signal"".

Though Damiba had promised to make security his priority when he took charge on 24 January, violent attacks have increased since March.

In the north and east, towns have been blockaded by insurgents who have blown up bridges and attacked supply convoys.

As in bordering countries, insurgents affiliated with Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group have stoked unrest.

Thousands have died and about two million have been displaced by the fighting since 2015 when the insurgency spread to Burkina Faso, which has since become the epicentre of the violence across the Sahel.

In September, a particularly bloody month, Damiba sacked his defence minister and assumed the role himself.

Earlier this week, suspected jihadists attacked a convoy carrying supplies to the town of Djibo in the north of the country. The government said 11 soldiers died and around 50 civilians were missing."
1065626790,20221001,"The president of the European Union's executive arm travelled Saturday to Bulgaria for the opening of a natural gas link between the country and Greece, emphasising the EU's determination to stop relying on Russian energy imports.

Speaking at a ceremony in Sofia, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the pipeline as an important contribution to limiting opportunities for Russia to use its gas and oil reserves to blackmail or punish the EU.

This pipeline changes the energy security situation for Europe. This project means freedom, von der Leyen told an audience that included heads of state and government from the region.

The European Commission committed nearly 250 million euros to finance the project, von der Leyen said.

The importance of the Gas Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria pipeline, which was completed in July, has significantly risen after Moscow decided to turn its natural gas deliveries into a political weapon.

A second European pipeline started operating Saturday when fuel flowed through the new Baltic Pipe, which was built to carry gas from Norway's North Sea deposits, through Denmark and across the Baltic seabed to a compressor station in northwestern Poland. It's full capacity is expected to be reached next year.

Polish, Danish and Norwegian officials opened the pipeline Tuesday in northern Poland, stressing its role for the region's independence from Russian natural gas.

Russia has cut some of its gas deliveries to Europe to demonstrate its opposition to sanctions the EU imposed over the war in Ukraine. Unusual leaks this week on the two Nord Stream pipelines that carry Russian gas to Germany exacerbated concerns about safeguarding Europe's energy supplies.

In late April, Russia cut off gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland after they refused Moscow's demand to pay for the deliveries in rubles, Russia's currency.

Relations between the former Soviet bloc allies have tanked in recent months over the war in Ukraine.

Last month Bulgaria ordered the expulsion of 70 Russian diplomats, triggering an angry response from Moscow.

People in Bulgaria and across Europe are feeling the consequences of Russia's war. But thanks to projects like this, Europe will have enough gas for the winter, von der Leyen said.

""Europe has everything it needs to break free from our dependency on Russia. It is a matter of political will.

The 182-kilometer conduit runs from the northeastern Greek city of Komotini, where it links to the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, up to Stara Zagora in central Bulgaria. Plans call for an initial capacity of 3 billion cubic meters of gas a year, and the prospect of future expansion to 5 billion cubic meters.

The Bulgarian executive of the project, Teodora Georgieva, said the pipeline would help supply other countries in southeastern Europe.

We have the opportunity to supply gas to the Western Balkans, to ensure supplies to Moldova and Ukraine, Georgieva said.

Planned on and off since the early 2000s, the Baltic Pipe received the green light in 2016 under Poland's current right-wing government, which wants to make the country fully independent of Russian energy sources.

The expansion in Denmark consists of an approximately 210-kilometers pipeline, a new compressor station and an expansion of a receiving terminal.

The project received financial support from the ."

On Saturday, several witnesses told AFP they heard gunfire in the centre of the capital Ouagadougou, after which troops once again blocked the main roads in the city, including around the presidency.

1065632876,20221001,"On Friday 30 September 2022, Luxembourg's Minister for Energy, Claude Turmes, participated in the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the European Union (EU) energy ministers.

The ministers reached an agreement on emergency measures to help households and businesses in the EU in the face of soaring energy prices. The proposals presented by the European Commission, aiming to recover part of the superprofits of energy producers to redistribute them to consumers and to impose a reduction in the demand for electricity at peak times, were approved.

Minister Turmes praised the fact that the EU Council of Ministers reached a political agreement: ""This agreement introduces emergency measures, which aim in particular to reduce electricity consumption at peak times. I am also particularly pleased with the capping of excessive market revenues for electricity producers who have benefited from abnormally high prices. This is a measure of social justice"".

The revenue cap is aimed at producers of electricity from nuclear and renewable energies (wind, solar, hydroelectric) who benefit from exceptional profits by selling it at a price much higher than their production costs. The cap will be set at €180 per megawatt hour (MWh) and the difference between this rate and the wholesale market price must be recovered by the States to be redistributed to households and businesses. For Luxembourg, which is a major electricity importing country, the text provides a legal framework for concluding a bilateral agreement with Germany in order to achieve a fair cross-border distribution of income, in application of the principle of solidarity.

Minister Turmes also called for the establishment of a European platform for joint gas purchases as quickly as possible in a spirit of European solidarity. He recalled: ""In the longer term, we must accelerate structural measures that will improve our security of energy supply and bring down prices: the reduction of energy consumption and the rapid deployment of renewable energies""."
1065635093,20221001,"Burkina Faso's new self-declared leader Ibrahim Traore has accused the president he deposed in a military coup on Friday of plotting a counterattack, blaming him for the violence which continued on Saturday.

Traore said that ousted President Paul-Henri Damiba was responsible for the gunfire reported earlier in the day in the capital Ouagadougou. He added that Damiba has taken refuge at a French base.

""We have managed to calm the situation,"" Traore said.

The French Foreign Ministry denied the Burkinabe coup leader’s claims of any French involvement.

Traore's statements came in the midst of an outpouring of condemnation for the military coup, the second to take place in the West African state this year. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged ""all actors to refrain from violence and seek dialogue.""

A group of Burkina Faso army soldiers announced late Friday that they ousted junta leader Paul-Henri Damiba, who had himself come to power through a military coup last January.

The soldiers introduced Captain Traore as the West African nation's new strongman. They blamed Damiba for failing to put an end to the Islamist insurgency the country has been witnessing.

Damiba's whereabouts were unknown following the military takeover.

On Saturday afternoon there were still signs of violence in the capital Ouagadougou, despite a relative calm in the early hours of the day.

Gunshots in the city center were reported. Security forces drove around in a convoy, while helicopters hovered above. Military troops blocked some of the city's main roads, including the vicinity of the presidential palace.

The AFP news agency said that shops were soon to shut their doors after initially opening for business in the morning.

The French embassy advised its citizens to limit their movements, saying that ""the situation remains tense in Ouagadougou."" French nationals in the country are believed to range between 4,000 and 5,000.

Several international organizations in the African continent and beyond were wary of this second coup's impact on the country's already glacial return toward a constitutional government.

The UN Secretary General's statement said that ""Burkina Faso needs peace, stability and unity to fight terrorist groups and criminal networks operating in parts of the country.""

The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell deplored in a statement ""the degradation of the security and humanitarian situation in the country.""

The African Union called for an immediate and total abstention of acts of violence or threats to civilians, civil liberties or human rights. The AU statement also urged for free and fair elections to be held by July 2024, as per the initial plan set out by the deposed Damiba.

AU chief Moussa Faki Mahamat described the coup as an ""unconstitutional change of government."" The union had already suspended Burkina Faso after the January coup.

The Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS), the political and economic union of fifteen countries in the region, echoed similar sentiments.

Equally keen to reestablish democratic governance, it said it found ""this new power grab inappropriate at a time when progress has been made.""

The United States called on all actors involved to return to ""calm and restraint.""

What was the political situation in Burkina Faso?

Friday's coup came eight months after the military junta seized power on January 24, overthrowing President Roch Kabore, and dissolving the government.

At the time, Damiba vowed to restore security, blaming the civilian government rather than his own military for years of violence perpetrated by Islamist militants linked to al-Qaida and the so-called Islamic State (IS) armed group. But attacks have persisted, and the army remained in disarray having seized power.

However, new data provided to TechRadar Pro by digital intelligence platform SimilarWeb indicates that the growth of veteran privacy-focused and is stalling.

A rough estimate of Opera’s user acquisition rate (based on traffic to the browser installation page) suggests June was an especially low point, marking a 23.1% decrease in pace of growth since the start of the year. There have been minor gains since then, but Opera appears to be becoming less and less attractive to new users.

Meanwhile, Firefox has fared even worse, perhaps as a consequence of the decision to focus on and other privacy products. In August, visits to the browser’s install page were down 7% on January, and its (opens in new tab) (which once sat at 30%) has fallen to just 3.35%.

The raw data shows that Firefox currently attracts only a few hundred thousand new users each month, while Opera is drawing in circa two million. Market leader Google Chrome, however, is thought to be used by more than 3.1 billion (opens in new tab) people.

The rise of the “big default browser”

The release of the figures by SimilarWeb coincided with a (opens in new tab) published by Mozilla in late September 2022 that accused Google, Microsoft and Apple of “abusing their privileged position” to make it “difficult or impossible” for users to change the browsers set as default by the operating system.

Battle lines have already been drawn this year with targeting Google, Apple and Meta’s stranglehold in browsers, search engines and other markets. Google also recently relating to restrictions on manufacturers of Android devices designed to “consolidate the dominant position of its search engine”, according to a spokesperson for the EU’s General Court.

Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are both overwhelmingly popular defaults that trade almost entirely on brand recognition and their status as default options across multiple operating systems (Chrome on and Android, and Edge on ). Other “big defaults” include the macOS and iOS versions of .

“Default settings can create burdens for consumers who prefer to use a browser other than the default, but who are unable to or unaware how to change their default. We know from our research that some consumers adopt unnecessarily cumbersome workarounds to stick with their preference,” the Mozilla report claims.

Mozilla’s report offers some explanation as to why operating system providers pursue these kinds of strategies, stating that the developers of “big default” browsers stand to profit from user data.

“Although consumers don’t pay to use browsers, their browsing history is valuable data for platforms with advertising businesses like Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft. It is not coincidental that many of these companies have yet to implement robust anti-tracking technologies in their browsers or deprecate third-party cookies,” said Mozilla.

However, the firm also acknowledged that Big Tech’s motives extend beyond data collection: the operators of the “big default” browsers make significant sums through advertisements served to users locked into their proprietary search engines.

“Google Chrome is captive to Google Search (powered by Google advertising) and Microsoft Edge is captive to Bing search (powered by Microsoft advertising). Independent browsers are the only companies able to freely consider search defaults on behalf of their consumers. They are also among the few companies to encourage discovery, evaluation, adoption and innovation of alternative search and advertising experiences.”

Although the likes of Mozilla and Opera have struggled of late, an enduring demand for “alternative” web browsers is supported by separate data from SimilarWeb.

From January through August, privacy-focused Brave Browser saw its estimated monthly downloads surge 272%. Admittedly, Brave saw just 17,827 and 66,340 hits to its installation page during these months, respectively, but that’s a significant rate of growth nonetheless.

These numbers suggest the continued success of “big default” browsers likely isn’t just the result of the suppression of alternatives, but also a function of user apathy and brand recognition.

While Big Tech seeks pure profit, privacy-focused browsers may simply be fighting amongst themselves. The growth in installs Brave has seen this year suggests Mozilla Firefox and Opera are losing market share to newer options, such as Brave and DuckDuckGo’s new Privacy Browser (for which we don’t currently have any data).

Crucially, the statistics also suggest that the push for web browser privacy may be a small movement, but one that’s still capable of gaining traction.

Apple’s decision to let users change their default browser in iOS 14 is a welcome one in the fight to get consumers to care about their online privacy, but the first step towards total browser independence is to abolish the idea of defaults completely - something that may never happen with Apple maintaining its own “big default” on the most popular mobile operating system in the US .

As things stand, Mozilla may have made the mistake of assuming that every ”big default” browser user is a potential convert. User apathy will always play into the hands of large and powerful companies; even minus suppression tactics, “big default” browsers would still trounce independent alternatives in monthly growth.

With a solution like inviting users to choose their own default browser from a list of privacy-focused alternatives, alongside simple, reasoned arguments for doing so, that apathy could wane. It’s just that legislating for something like this seems unthinkable to most lawmakers outside the European Union.

Mozilla, DuckDuckGo, and eleven other companies did recently lobby the US Congress to table a data privacy bill that would address Big Tech monopolies, default browsers, and unfettered data collection, but the chances of the move leading anywhere are slim, thanks to Big Tech’s lobbying resources.

In addition, the lack of regulations surrounding “revolving doors” (whereby politicians leave office, often for corporate positions, and use their connections to curry favor with lawmakers) in territories such as the and mean that legislating for web privacy and freedom of choice for anonymous browsers there may turn out to be an extremely slow process, if not a completely insurmountable problem.

 

 Would privacy-focused browsers see more even growth if users were given the option to make an informed choice between them? The problem, right now, is that we might never get to find out.

President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered Russia’s first mobilization since World War Two, warning the West that if it continued what he called its “nuclear blackmail” that Moscow would respond with the might of all its vast arsenal.



The partial mobilization significantly escalates the conflict over Ukraine and comes as Russia battles a Ukrainian counter-offensive that has forced its troops to retreat and surrender some occupied territory.

He restated his aim was to “liberate” east Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland region and that most people in the region did not want to return to what he called the “yoke” of Ukraine.



Russia already considers Luhansk and Donetsk, which together make up the Donbas region Moscow partially occupied in 2014, to be independent states. Ukraine and the West consider all parts of Ukraine held by Russian forces to be illegally occupied.

Speaking at a ceremony in Sofia, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the pipeline as an important contribution to limiting opportunities for Russia to use its gas and oil reserves to blackmail or punish the EU.

“This pipeline changes the energy security situation for Europe. This project means freedom,“ von der Leyen told an audience that included heads of state and government from the region.

The European Commission committed nearly 250 million euros to finance the project, she said.

The importance of the Gas Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria pipeline, which was completed in July, has risen significantly after Moscow decided to turn its natural gas deliveries into a political weapon.

A second European pipeline started operating Saturday when fuel flowed through the new Baltic Pipe, which was built to carry gas from Norway’s North Sea deposits through Denmark and across the Baltic seabed to a compressor station in northwestern Poland. It’s full capacity is expected to be reached next year.

Polish, Danish and Norwegian officials opened the pipeline Tuesday in northern Poland, stressing its role for the region’s independence from Russian natural gas.

Russia has significantly cut some of its gas deliveries to Europe to demonstrate its opposition to sanctions the EU imposed over the war in Ukraine. In addition, huge methane leaks this week due to sabotage on the two undersea Nord Stream pipelines between Russian and Germany have exacerbated concerns about safeguarding Europe’s energy supplies.

In late April, Russia cut off gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland after they refused Moscow’s demand to pay for the deliveries in rubles, Russia’s currency. In June, Bulgaria ordered the expulsion of 70 Russian diplomats, triggering an angry response from Moscow.

“People in Bulgaria and across Europe are feeling the consequences of Russia’s war. But thanks to projects like this, Europe will have enough gas for the winter,” von der Leyen said. “Europe has everything it needs to break free from our dependency on Russia. It is a matter of political will.”

The 182-kilometer (115-mile) conduit runs from the northeastern Greek city of Komotini, where it links to the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, up to Stara Zagora in central Bulgaria. Plans call for an initial capacity of 3 billion cubic meters of gas a year, and the prospect of future expansion to 5 billion cubic meters.

The Bulgarian executive of the project, Teodora Georgieva, said the pipeline would help supply other countries in southeastern Europe.

“We have the opportunity to supply gas to the Western Balkans, to ensure supplies to Moldova and Ukraine,” Georgieva said.

Planned since the early 2000s, the Baltic Pipe received the green light in 2016 under Poland’s right-wing government, which wants to make the country fully independent of Russian energy sources.

The entire offshore route is 275 kilometers (170 miles) long. The expansion in Denmark consists of an approximately 210-kilometer (130-mile) pipeline, a new compressor station and an expansion of a receiving terminal. The project received financial support from the EU.

This story corrects that 70 Russians were expelled in June, not last month.

1065639339,20221001,"At the cusp of the 2022 presidential elections, Brazilian politics stands polarised between Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Jair Bolsonaro. The urgency to defeat the latter has been evoked to shut down critical thinking. However, Bolsonaro embodies social forces that will not go away with an electoral defeat even as an eventual Lula comeback would only respond in part to popular aspirations.

In order to avoid illusions and find alternative paths, it is necessary to look at social dynamics beneath the political surface. Critical thinking cannot be replaced by wishful thinking. This is the context in which we have drafted our note. We are a group of professors, researchers and artists who are also activists, and gather regularly to discuss Brazil and the world we live in, as part of an effort to devise new landscapes for Left politics.

Those signing this piece are for Bolsonaro’s defeat. So we want Lula to win in the October election. But everything indicates that this is not a conventional election, because its outcome may lead to developments well beyond what we might normally expect from the electoral process.

A Bolsonaro victory could open the doors for a coup – as could his defeat. Nothing is certain. And yet, Bolsonaro’s electoral defeat would at least guarantee that any coup-mongering would remain illegitimate and illegal.

In defence of legality, a new consensus has emerged within civil society – one in which the political spectrum represented is even wider than that seen in the campaign for re-democratisation that birthed the New Republic in the 1980s.

Parties, trade unions, social movements, personalities, a large part of the media and the bosses’ associations – and, indirectly, the US government, as various authorities there have stated that the result of elections must be respected – have united in defence of democracy and the rule of law. This consensus has surfaced in political gatherings, manifestos and other public stands – both collective and individual.

Why has this happened so late in the day, given that Bolsonaro has never concealed his contempt for democracy? Our impression is that this consensus, in defence of institutions that have long been under threat, signifies a general accord to endorse a Lula presidency.

The aspirations of a significant part of society to oppose Bolsonarism and its coup-mongering speeches and demonstrations are understandable and legitimate. A wide consensus can provide a feeling of relief in the face of the far-right avalanche of recent times. The more support against Bolsonaro, the better.

However, it was only when the economic elite took a stand – with the backing of the mainstream media as well as the United States’ seal of approval – that a national campaign against Bolsonaro’s coup-mongering began. This only took place in the final stretch of Bolsonaro’s term. Nevertheless, in contrast to the diretas já pro-democracy campaign of the 1980s, this campaign has not been accompanied by mass awareness-raising and support.

Meetings take place indoors, sometimes in exclusive places. It seems that this “democratic consensus” has been stitched together in the upper reaches of Brazilian society. If Lula wins, he will have wide support from the establishment. This is a very different scenario compared to his first candidacy at the eve of the New Republic in 1989, when the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) had a wide popular constituency but no support from the establishment.

The new democratic consensus can be seen as an accord signed by political leaderships and elites. Its electoral effect is to undersign a probable Lula victory. But why? It was with elite support that Bolsonaro accelerated various destructive and uncontrollable tendencies – ones which have now become counterproductive to the smooth functioning of Brazilian capitalism. Burning the Amazon has hindered a deal with the European Union (EU); defaming the Chinese has hurt agro-business exports; overall, political instability has contributed to devalue the Brazilian currency and inhibit foreign investment.

As it was starkly put by one of the organisers of the “Charter for Democracy” (launched at the University of São Paulo’s law school, a bastion of the establishment): “The chaos in the country is making the business world lose money.”

Could it be that in the name of fighting authoritarianism, there is an attempt to put a stop to this self-destructive tendency, at least temporarily? Behind the new consensus, is there not a new attempt to contain Brazil’s crisis? Is it possible that capitalists in Brazil and elsewhere can unite to save capitalism from governments like Bolsonaro’s?

Who will pay for the consensus?

It may be that the strength and breadth of the new consensus is actually a symptom of its weakness. This is because the country is faced with short and long term economic and social degradation on a scale that will restrict the room for manoeuvre of any new consensus. In this context of ongoing devastation, it is possible that even very limited social policies, such as those Lula promises, will have a major effect.

There are many indeterminate elements in the short term – and the election itself is undecided. But nothing indicates the return of the favourable international winds that benefited Lulismo in the 2010s, when the commodities supercycle favoured win-win policies: business made money but those from below also had benefits. Hence our unease, caused by the feeling that we’re dealing with an “unrealistic pragmatism”: an attitude that ignores what needs to be done in the face of a crisis that cannot be resolved at the ballot box.

Who will pay for this indifference in the face of crisis?

From the point of view of elites, the new consensus may be a tactical repositioning in pursuit of pacification: an indication of conciliatory politics that seeks to remedy the immediate ills of the country. But this accord does not represent a return to the New Republic. Instead it looks like a moment for reorganisation. Something, it seems, is being cooked up. In the long run, an agenda similar to Bolsonaro’s might come back, but in different political hands.

The return of the Lulista consensus may be a step back, by a ruling class seeking a way out of the New Republic. In essence, it would be the antechamber of new battles. The new consensus seems to be a truce, in view of then returning to the inevitable war.

The dynamic of war emerges out of the forms of reproduction of Brazilian life. There is a war from above, against those below. There is a war by the state against the black and poor population. But, above all, there is a daily war, because we have a form of life based in competition: the unemployed compete with the unemployed, and also with the employed. In turn, the employed compete with their work colleagues. On TV, Big Brother reflects this dynamic of competition and exclusion: without the spectre of eviction, there is no spectacle. In sum, daily life is lived as a war: “I’m struggling.”

This war has not been voted for: it doesn’t matter who wins the election, the war will continue. But what political forms will this dynamic take? Which political bodies will clash?

Two worlds unknown to each other

For the vast majority who experience this war, democracy seems like a concern of the upper reaches of society. There are two worlds mobilising, but which ignore each other. In the world ignored by those above, the social imaginary is that of a political battlefield. Police officers and pastors see themselves as defenders of the fatherland and of good against evil, while Christians give themselves up to an eternal war for the redemption of a corrupt world and of the evils that, one day, will disappear. These desires go well beyond the immediate needs of material survival. One of the keys to the far right’s success appears to be their embrace of these desires that mobilise the popular imagination.

We are faced with two paths. On one side, where the masses barely figure, there’s a campaign for legality and for the defence of institutions, rooted in conciliation. On the other path there is a torrent crossing through the elections, carrying political mobilisation. It fills the streets with Marches for Jesus (a yearly evangelical demonstration that draws millions) and other events in which change is understood as coming through salvation – the outcome of the war. Although not organised by Bolsonaro, they have been staunch supporters of his politics.

From their point of view, with Lula’s win, a battle would be lost but not the war. On the fringes of the liberals and progressives who have now joined hands are those who are also preparing for an inevitable war. But their war appears to be against both sides: the liberals and the PT.

Does a war of all against all produce society? Or does it produce a violent social dynamic that appears ungovernable? For many, the ungovernable demands order – at any price. It provokes a desire for a violence that orders. Bolsonaro can be seen as one iteration of this politics. It is likely that other, more capable versions will be developed. The future of this present will be contested by these new iterations.

The world in crisis is here, and our politics have little to say

We are facing a total environmental crisis, in relation to which Brazil’s responsibilities are decisive. A change in the energy paradigm is urgently needed, and there are risks of planetary food shortages. There is a global crisis of investment and in the production of wealth – a crisis that has now reached the proportions of a European war, and which threatens to become a world war.

China’s industrial might and its emerging technological supremacy is leading to the threat of an embargo by, and even war with, a US that is unable to revive its economy. Authoritarian, fascist and regressive tendencies are appearing in various places around the world. This all indicates a social and economic crisis of the system itself, one which exceeds the capacities of national responses. And yet we must respond, on the basis of our national experiences and powers, to this universal impasse.

We live in a world that produces abundance, but this abundance is experienced as scarcity. This curse has a name: the commodity. We must recognise that scarcity, which puts us in competition with each other, is a political construct. Is it not of the utmost urgency that we politically confront this politics?

The Brazilian electoral debate does not go beyond the surface of the problems society confronts. Politics beyond election might be needed to change what elections do not.

It is technically possible to liberate people from alienating work and to share social wealth. But it is politically impossible at the present moment. And yet, it appears that only such an impossible politics is capable of disarming the war.

So, doesn’t the impossible need to become possible?

The path on the other side

It is unclear whether peace has a future. But what is clear is that we will only have an emancipated future to match our imaginations if we are able to escape from the politics of the commodity. Elections, at our current stage, serve only to disguise this fact. On the other side of the elections, perhaps we will be able to find a path.

1065646869,20221001,"Thirty Council of Europe member states have committed to a “Dublin Declaration” outlining a series of steps to promote gender equality in order to help prevent domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.

The declaration was adopted by Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine and the United Kingdom following a two-day conference of justice ministers organised by Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of Europe.

Inspired by the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention on violence against women, and expert findings on the implementation of the convention so far, states backing the declaration committed to:
• actively promoting, at the highest level, an institutional and political culture which rejects gender-based discrimination and violence, sexism, gender stereotypes and gendered power dynamics in the public and private sector
• ensuring that strategies aimed at preventing and combating violence against women also address the specific role of men and boys in preventing violence against women
• systematically including awareness-raising campaigns as an integral and fully funded part of long-term action plans on violence against women
• taking measures to include in the official curriculum, of all levels of education, teaching material on issues such as the principle of equality between women and men, non-stereotyped gender roles, mutual respect, non-violent conflict resolution in interpersonal relationships, gender-based violence against women and the right to personal integrity
• providing guidelines for educational material in this area and the training of educational professionals, as well as the creation of knowledge platforms to share best practices
• encouraging initial and in-service training of all relevant professionals, including within the criminal justice system
• taking all possible measures to ensure that episodes of violence are taken into consideration by courts when deciding upon custody and visitation rights
• increasing the provision of perpetrator programmes for domestic violence and for sexual violence operating on the standards and principles set out in the Istanbul Convention
• asking the Council of Europe to carry out a comparative study in member states on the existing models and approaches taken to perpetrator programmes and their results
• inviting states that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Istanbul Convention and reinforce efforts to implement existing international legal standards in the area of gender equality and violence against women

To date, 37 Council of Europe member states have ratified the Istanbul Convention, enabling its entry into force in those countries. Armenia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania the Slovak Republic – and the European Union as a whole – have signed, but not yet ratified, the convention. Azerbaijan has not yet signed the convention and Türkiye denounced it in March 2021."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 01st October, 2022) The Netherlands regrets Nicaragua's decision to sever diplomatic relations and will discuss further steps with the European Union, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said on Saturday.

""The Netherlands regrets the disproportionate decision by Nicaragua to break off diplomatic relations. We take a firm stand on the worsening democratic structures and human rights violations in Nicaragua. But a critical discussion is always better than ending relations,"" Hoekstra wrote on Twitter.

The Netherlands will also discuss its further steps with the European Union, according to Hoekstra.

The minister stated that other countries had also had ""difficulties in maintaining an open dialogue"" with Nicaragua.

On Friday, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega condemned the Netherlands' alleged interference in his country's affairs and said that he did not want to maintain relations with ""this interventionist government.

"" This happened after Dutch Ambassador to Central America Christine Pirenne visited the Nicaraguan capital of Managua and spoke with local residents ""as if Nicaragua were a Dutch colony,"" as described by the Nicaraguan president.

In 2013, the Netherlands optimized its diplomatic presence in Central America by closing its embassy in Nicaragua. The Dutch ambassador to Central America, based in Costa Rica, was in charge of relations with this country since then.

For many years, Nicaragua has been criticized by Western countries for violations of human rights and the oppression of political opposition. Ortega is currently serving his fourth term as the country's president."

1065655374,20221001,"OUAGADOUGOU — Burkina Faso’s self-declared leader says the man he ousted a day ago in a coup is plotting a counter-attack.



Col. Ibrahim Traoré also accused the French army of harboring Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba at one of its bases — but France denies any involvement.



Gunshots have been heard in Burkina Faso’s capital city Ouagadougou and helicopters have circled overhead.



Witnesses say troops have blocked main roads around the city and shops that had opened earlier are now shut.



Demonstrators started a fire outside the French embassy in Ouagadougou, Radio France International (RFI) reported on Saturday.



The gate of the French Institute in the second city, Bobo-Dioulasso, was also set ablaze by protesters, RFI added.



Friday’s apparent takeover had been announced on national TV and was the second time this year that the country’s army had seized power.



On both occasions the coup leaders said they had to step in because national security was so dire.



Burkina Faso controls as little as 60% of its territory, experts say, and extermists violence is worsening. Since 2020 more than a million people have been displaced in the country due to the violence.



The African Union has demanded the return of constitutional order by July 2023 at the latest, agreeing with the regional group ECOWAS that the ousting of leader Lt. Col. Damiba was “unconstitutional”.



ECOWAS earlier said it was “inappropriate” for army rebels to seize power when the country was working towards civilian rule.



The latest international criticism has come from the UN, whose chief António Guterres said he “strongly condemns” the coup.



For the second time in under 24 hours the coup leaders have issued a statement on national TV, signed by their leader Col. Ibrahim Traoré.



This time they claimed Lt. Col. Damiba was planning a counter-attack because of their own willingness to work with new partners in their fight against the extremists.



The statement did not name these potential new partners, but rights groups say troops in neighboring Mali have been working closely with Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group — although both nations deny this.



On Friday evening flanked by rebel soldiers in fatigues and black facemasks, an officer had read an announcement on national TV stating that they were kicking out Lt. Col. Damiba, dissolving the government and suspending the constitution.



That statement was also read on behalf of an army captain called Col. Traoré, who said Lt. Col. Damiba’s inability to deal with an insurgency was to blame. “Our people have suffered enough, and are still suffering”, he said.



Little is known about Col Traoré, the 34-year-old soldier who led an anti-extremist unit in the north called Cobra.



His statement effectively declared himself the interim leader of Burkina Faso. But in Friday’s announcement came the promise that the “driving forces of the nation” would in time be brought together to appoint a new civilian or military president and a new “transitional charter”.



Lt. Col. Damiba’s junta overthrew an elected government in January citing a failure to halt terrorists attacks, and he himself told citizens “we have more than what it takes to win this war.”



But his administration has also not been able to quell the violence. Analysts told the BBC recently that insurgents were encroaching on territory, and military leaders had failed in their attempts to bring the military under a single unit of command.



On Monday, 11 soldiers were killed when they were escorting a convoy of civilian vehicles in Djibo in the north of the country.



The United States said it was “deeply concerned” by events in Burkina Faso and encouraged its citizens to limit movements in the country. France issued a similar warning to its more than 4,000 citizens living in the capital city Ouagadougou.



“We call for a return to calm and restraint by all actors,” a US State Department spokesperson said.



In January, Lt. Col. Damiba ousted President Roch Kaboré, saying that he had failed to deal with growing militant Islamist violence.



But many citizens do not feel any safer and there have been protests in different parts of the country this week.



On Friday afternoon, some protesters took to the capital’s streets calling for the removal of Lt. Col. Damiba. The country has experienced eight successful coups since independence in 1960.



The European Union on Saturday denounced the new coup in Burkina Faso after soldiers announced on Friday night that they have overthrown the Burkina Faso military government in the country’s second coup this year.



EU High Representative Josep Borrell in a Declaration on behalf of the 27-bloc said the coup jeopardizes the efforts undertaken for several months, in particular by ECOWAS, (Economic Community of West African States) to supervise the Transition.



The EU called for compliance with the commitments made, which formed the basis of the agreement reached with ECOWAS on July 3, in order to support Burkina Faso towards a return to constitutional order no later than July 1, 2024.



The EU also deplored the deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in the country, and said it remains at the side of the people of Burkina Faso in these difficult times. — BBC"
