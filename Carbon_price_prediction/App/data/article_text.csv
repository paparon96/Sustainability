1064721372,20220926,"UNITED NATIONS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 26th September, 2022) Venezuela welcomes the wider use of the ruble at its resorts and hopes that tourist flows from Russia will rebound in the nearest future, Foreign Minister Carlos Faria told Sputnik.

""It is no secret that Russia seeks to expand the use of the ruble, bringing it to other countries... As for Venezuela, this would benefit the development of our tourism, because, as we know, hundreds of Russian tourists are flying to Margarita Island,"" Faria said on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

The minister noted that the number of Russian tourists visiting Venezuelan resorts is in the thousands.

""This process was suspended due to the sanctions imposed against Russia, which is preventing Russia from using the usual routes to send planes to our continent. It will restart. This will greatly help the development of tourism in our country,"" Faria noted.

Tourists flows have been disrupted worldwide due to the pandemic. Moreover, in February 2022, the European Union closed its airspace to all Russian flights as part of sanctions against Moscow over the country's special military operation in Ukraine."
1064726300,20220926,"Britain's new prime minister said she would prefer a negotiated solution with the European Union to issues relating to the Northern Ireland protocol, the deal negotiated as part of Brexit that Britain has tried to override.

Prime Minister Liz Truss, who has been accused of having a tense relationship with the E.U. while serving as British foreign secretary, told CNN's State of the Union on Sunday in her first U.S. television interview since taking office that she was still seeking such a solution. Truss formally became prime minister earlier this month, leaving her in charge of addressing the Northern Ireland matter, which stems from decades of bloodshed between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and thus Catholics and Protestants, respectively.

""Well, President Biden and I both agree that what is vital is to protect the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement,"" Truss told CNN's Jake Tapper when asked what compromises she was willing to make in negotiations with the E.U. ""But what's important is that we protect and respect the positions of both the nationalist community in Northern Ireland, as well as the unionist community in Northern Ireland. So, what I want to do is find a way forward. And my preference is a negotiated solution with the EU that protects that North-South relationship, but also protects the East-West relationship.""

The Good Friday Agreement was approved in 1998, ending decades of deadly fighting between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The two nations share a border, though Northern Ireland is a part of the U.K. while Ireland is part of the E.U., giving the body a say in post-Brexit decisions on the matter. Negotiators have failed to make a deal that does not violate the accord or create a situation where a hard border or no border would be placed between the two countries. Global onlookers have cautioned that any alterations to the Good Friday Agreement could put peace between the two countries at risk.

Truss served as foreign secretary under her predecessor, Boris Johnson, before taking on her new role. In that position, she unsuccessfully tried to engage with the E.U. over the Northern Ireland issue, which had reached a stalemate, before pushing unilateral changes through British parliament to ease the flow of goods within the U.K. Truss also went as far as to try to dissolve the Northern Ireland protocol altogether through parliamentary measures, though that effort failed.

The E.U. has insisted that the U.K. should maintain an internal border on its own territory so as to avoid having one between the U.K. and the E.U. in Ireland. Both Brexit negotiators and Truss have been unable to move them on the issue.

President Joe Biden, who Truss referenced, as well as other top U.S. leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have warned against making any moves that disrupt peace in Northern Ireland. Both have said publicly they would not approve a new U.S.-U.K. trade agreement without guarantees that the border issue would be addressed.

Truss discussed her views on the United States and the U.S.-U.K. relationship with Tapper, after he asked her to address concerns that she was not as committed to maintaining it as her predecessors had been.

""I think that the U.S. is an incredibly close partner of the U.K. I do think our relationship is special,"" the British prime minister said. ""And it's increasingly important at a time when we're facing threats from Russia, increased assertiveness from China. We are both freedom-loving democracies. We have such a strong connection.""

Pressed further on the matter, Truss dug in, saying: ""I'm personally a huge fan of the United States of America. And it's a country I've traveled a lot in. It's a country that we share so many values and core beliefs in, and I'm determined that we make the special relationship even more special over the coming years.""

1064727364,20220926,"On the margins of a summit meant as a show of force for a Russian leader seeking a turnaround on the battlefield, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India leaned in with a different message.

“Democracy, diplomacy and dialogue” — not war — is the answer, he told Russian President Vladimir Putin as the cameras rolled on Sept. 16, before declaring that the two would speak more about how to bring peace in Ukraine.

That assured interaction in Uzbekistan was the latest display of India’s rise under Modi. An ambitious and assertive power, India has become increasingly indispensable in the search for answers to some of the world’s most pressing challenges, from diplomacy to climate change to technology and trade to efforts at diversifying supply chains to counter China.

It is India’s credentials as the world’s largest democracy that Modi rides on the global stage. But at home, diplomats, analysts and activists say, Modi’s government is undertaking a project to remake India’s democracy unlike any in its 75 years of independence — stifling dissent, sidelining civilian institutions and making minorities second-class citizens.

While past Indian leaders exploited religious divisions and weaponized institutions to stay in power, Modi’s focus has been more fundamental: a systematic consolidation of power achieved not through dramatic power grabs but through more subtle and lasting means, aimed at imprinting a majoritarian Hindu ideology on India’s constitutionally secular democracy.

Modi has bent to his will on the courts, the news media, the legislature and civil society — “referee” institutions that guarded India’s democracy in a region of military coups and entrenched dictatorships. As he has done so, the country’s indispensability on major global issues, coupled with challenges to democracy in both the United States and Europe, has ensured little pushback from Western allies.

The question for India and the world is whether the country can remain an engine for growth and a viable partner even as its heavy-handed marginalization of minorities, particularly its 200 million Muslims, stokes cycles of extremism and perpetual volatility at home.

The contradictions of India’s rise were crystallized in Germany in late June when Modi stood alongside the leaders of the Group of 7 major industrialized nations as his public relations team worked to document his seeming intimacy with his counterparts: a shared laugh with President Joe Biden, an interlacing of fingers with Justin Trudeau of Canada.

But just as Modi was joining his hosts in signing a statement urging the defence of democracies and affirming ideals like “freedom of expression” and the “independence of civil society,” his government was continuing a crackdown on dissent back home.

Indian authorities arrested an activist critical of the prime minister’s past record on human rights and a fact-checker who had highlighted disparaging comments about Islam by a governing party spokesperson. Days earlier, officials had again rolled in bulldozers to raze the homes of Muslims as part of a campaign of “instant justice,” this time targeting activists accused of leading sometimes violent protests against the provocative remarks.

For now, Modi’s focus is on leveraging India’s strengths. As the global order has been disrupted by Covid, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and an expansionist Beijing, Modi’s lieutenants have made clear that they see this as their moment to establish India, on their own terms, among the foremost powers.

India is a rising economic force, having just passed Britain, its onetime colonial overlord, as the world’s fifth-largest economy. It is well positioned to prosper with its improving trade ties, large youth population and expanding technological infrastructure — a potential alternative, in the eyes of some democracies, to a future dominated by China.

Modi’s diplomats are emboldened to overcome seeming contradictions, such as holding military exercises with both Russia and the United States and increasing purchases of Russian oil despite American and European pressure.

India’s Western allies have shown little appetite to challenge the Modi government as it diverges from some of their professed democratic values.

A focus on trade and geopolitics has often pushed human rights to the back burner, analysts and diplomats said. With the European Union fast-tracking negotiations on a free-trade agreement with India, the talk is all “this deal, this deal, this deal,” one European diplomat in New Delhi said.

The United States, which two years into the Biden administration still does not have an ambassador in New Delhi, is reeling from former President Donald Trump’s assault on its democratic system. Its seriousness about a foreign policy that prioritizes human rights was questioned as the quest for cheaper oil took Biden this summer to Saudi Arabia, where he fist-bumped with the crown prince implicated in a journalist’s murder and dismemberment.

“The U.S. also has lost some of its authority to criticize other countries on their records on democracy,” said Lisa Curtis, a former senior U.S. national security official who leads the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.

In many ways, diplomats, officials and analysts said, India’s rise brings together two unique developments: a natural opening in the country’s often-uncertain post-colonial trajectory, and the emergence of a leader at the peak of his power who has spent half a century pursuing his vision from the ground up.

After India’s violent founding as an independent nation in 1947, the country remained consumed for decades with questions of whether it would remain intact and whether its economy could feed an enormous population. The moment to define itself, and its relations with the world, has come only after those questions have largely been settled.

Modi, 72, has spent his life in the trenches of a right-wing movement that calls India’s founding as a secular republic a grave injustice that accommodated minorities like Muslims and Christians at the cost of what they see as the Hindu majority’s rightful claims.

Modi’s political consolidation at the top, coupled with extensive welfare projects to maintain a strong voting base, has given India’s right-wing its most effective formula yet to bring about the cultural and systemic changes the movement has long fought for on the streets.

The country’s central investigating agencies have become willing levers of intimidation against dissenting voices, analysts say. Journalists and activists face frequent harassment, are mired in lengthy court cases or are thrown in jail under laws that make bail difficult. Independent institutions — from courts to parliament to the national human rights commission and the elections body — have been overwhelmed or have largely retreated, as the compliant are rewarded and detractors are punished.

Modi is not the first Indian leader to capture institutions and unleash them on political opponents, said Josy Joseph, who has chronicled a long history of abuses in his book “The Silent Coup.” The closest the country’s democracy has come to fracturing was in the 1970s when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared an emergency to jail opponents and censor the media in a bid to remain in power.

Joseph said Modi had been much more effective than Gandhi in achieving his aims, aided by an unparalleled propaganda operation — allied broadcast media and newspapers, and a social media machine reaching into every phone — that provides cover both at home and abroad.

Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party “have very cleverly combined India’s traditional democratic credentials and autocratic controls,” Joseph said.

Gopal Krishna Agarwal, a BJP spokesperson, attributed criticism of the government’s human rights record to politics and an unnamed “nexus globally” that cannot stomach India’s ascension.

“Our rise at the international level is because India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is looking out for Indian interests, taking independent decisions,” Agarwal said. “We are leveraging the strengths of India — whether it is the large youth population, resources, manufacturing strength, IT strength, human resource strength.”

Agarwal said the government’s approach to law and order should not be “classified as human rights violations.” He rejected the contention that Modi was deploying investigating agencies against his opponents, saying the raids were intended to clean up corruption.

“If somebody has objection to the investigation agency, there is courts, etc., which takes care of the balance of power,” he said.

But local courts, analysts and activists say, often act as a stamp for the executive’s abuses. The already-clogged higher courts struggle to keep up and are at times accused of aiding the executive by ignoring important cases of constitutional overreach. There are nearly 6 million cases pending in India’s high courts and more than 70,000 in the Supreme Court.

One tactic the governing party deploys is to jail critics under strict laws against terrorist activities and money laundering. The conviction rate is abysmal, but the process of exoneration serves the political purpose of spreading fear, critics say.

Siddique Kappan, a journalist, and his taxi driver were arrested in October 2020 as he tried to report on the government’s efforts to contain the blowback over a gruesome rape case. Before Kappan had even reached the village, the government charged him with intending to hurt local communal harmony. He was repeatedly denied bail.

When the Supreme Court of India finally heard his appeal this month, the judges took less than 30 minutes to rule that the government’s case for denying Kappan his freedom was flimsy at best and granted him bail. Both Kappan and the taxi driver had already spent nearly two years in jail. But even the highest court’s intervention did not free Kappan: He remains in jail under another pending case against him, while the driver has been freed.

“In our criminal justice system, the process is the punishment,” N.V. Ramana lamented before his retirement as India’s chief justice last month.

Modi’s confidence at home has extended into confidence abroad.

Officials in his government often denounce international indexes rating countries on key indicators like health or press and religious freedom, dismissing them as products of colonial agendas or foreign naivete on India’s civilizational approach — an attitude that reminds many diplomats of the stance often taken by authoritarian China.

“Shall we not set our own standards?” Modi said last month at an event marking his country’s 75 years of independence, as helicopters showered rose petals. “We want freedom from slavery.”

In April, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a rare public comment on India’s domestic policies that the United States was “monitoring some recent concerning developments in India, including a rise in human rights abuses by some government, police and prison officials.”

His Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar, fired back. “I would tell you that we also take our views on other people’s human rights situation, including that of the United States,” Jaishankar said during a visit to the United States. “So, we take up human rights issues when they arise in this country.”"

1064736426,20220926,"ROME — As Italians went to the polls on September 25, they cast their ballots against the backdrop of an unprecedented energy and climate crisis. Winter is fast approaching, and the next government will confront the tough task of protecting citizens and businesses while also setting Italy on a path to strengthen climate resilience and deliver its fair share of emissions reductions.

This summer's extreme weather was just a preview of the climate-driven turmoil that awaits us. Abnormal temperatures, drought and catastrophic flooding have killed several people and caused massive economic losses and damage. Italians would do well to remember that they reside in what climate scientists call a climate-change“hotspot”. With temperatures rising 20 per cent faster than the global average rate, the Mediterranean is one of the world's most climate-affected regions.

Italy itself has already experienced warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and the human and economic costs of its past emissions and short-term infrastructure choices are mounting. Between 1980 and 2020, Italy recorded more than 21,000 deaths due to extreme weather events, following only Germany and France in Europe. And in the last 50 years, landslides and flooding have forced more than 320,000 people to evacuate their homes, and eroded some 40 million square meters of beach front. Now, 91 per cent of Italy's cities and 12,000 cultural assets are at risk of landslides and floods.

The future looks ominous. Between now and 2100, Italy's summer temperatures could increase by up to 6°C, and summer rainfall could decrease by up to 40 per cent. Without urgent mitigation, heatwave days per year are expected to increase by an average of 400 per cent by 2050, and by up to 1,100 per cent by 2080. For a city like Rome, that could mean experiencing up to 28 days of extreme heat every year.

The economic costs will increase exponentially as the temperature rises, primarily affecting the most fragile segments of the population. According to some estimates, climate change could reduce Italy's per capita GDP by 8 per cent by 2100. Infrastructure losses could exceed 15 billion euros ($14.8 billion); the costs from rising sea levels and coastal flooding could reach almost €6 billion; agricultural land value could fall by over 160 billion euros; and the contraction of demand in the tourism sector could cost 52 billion euros (in part because only 18 per cent of resorts in the Italian Alps will still have natural snow cover suitable for the winter season).

Recent tragedies like the Marmolada glacier collapse and extreme flooding in Marche are emblematic of the new risk environment. They show how the socioeconomic and political consequences of climate change could trigger mass migration and new tensions over water, food, and energy resources.

Obviously, climate change is a major national-security threat for Italy. But one wouldn't know it from following Italian politics. While Italian voters are becoming more aware of the problem and are demanding action, very few options on the ballot channel these views. For decades, Italian governments and political parties have largely neglected the threat that climate change poses to the country's security and prosperity.

The failure to formulate credible plans for the energy transition reflects a broader refusal even to acknowledge the climate implications of Italy's current energy sources. In a country that has long been dominated by the natural-gas industry, both the political establishment and the mainstream media remain unwilling to question the state-controlled gas companies. As a result, only one-third of Italians recognize natural gas as a source of greenhouse-gas pollution, even though it is the country's largest source of emissions.

A new government offers a chance to change course; but the window for action is quickly closing. To avoid warming pathways that will eventually render large parts of the country unsafe for habitation or tourism, the next government must recognise that there is no climate security without the European Union.

The faster the world's major economies decarbonize, the better off Italy will be. The next government must support the EU's climate agenda and do its part to make it a success. It also must support investments in climate resilience around the world, particularly in Africa and the Mediterranean region, where climate-driven events are poised to become a major cause of mass migration.

Moreover, Italy needs major new public investments in decarbonisation; but because it must also abide by the principles of debt sustainability, it also will need innovative policies to mobilise the private sector behind climate action.

At the same time, the next government should recognise that attempting to achieve climate security through simple technological fixes or a top-down, command-and-control approach would inevitably provoke a political backlash. Democracy thrives on its capacity for innovation, accountability, transparency, and inclusion. Italian policymakers can no longer afford to leave the country's energy strategy in the hands of just a few companies, even if they are state-controlled.

Finally, the next government must appreciate the myriad interdependencies between the economy and the environment. There cannot be a safe economy without a safe climate, but nor can climate stability be achieved without a strong, fair economy. At the end of the day, there can be no choice between economic and environmental goals.

It remains to be seen what path the next government will take. While public opinion polls have been pointing to a victory for far-right parties, Italians of all political persuasions would support a program to preserve Italy's security and prosperity in a warming world.

1064742748,20220926,"On 24 September 2022, in New York, during the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia, Edgars Rinkēvičs, met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of South Africa (RSA), Naledi Pandor. The Ministers discussed bilateral relations, relations between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa, and cooperation in international organisations.

Edgars Rinkēvičs expressed his hope that the planned political consultations between the Foreign Ministries in Pretoria this coming October will provide an opportunity for identifying cooperation areas of mutual interest.

“We are interested in developing business contacts in information technology, education and science, and in the logistics and transport sector, making use of advantages offered by Latvia’s ports and its airport. Signing of a convention on the prevention of double taxation, an air transport agreement, or a memorandum on economic cooperation would facilitate the unlocking of cooperation potential,” Edgars Rinkēvičs underlined.

The Latvian Foreign Minister called on the RSA to consider applying to the citizens of Latvia the same entry conditions as to the largest part of EU citizens. This would make it possible to stay in the RSA visa-free for up to 90 days.

The Ministers also exchanged positions concerning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Latvian Foreign Minister drew attention to the fact that in 2025, for the first time, Latvia would stand as a candidate in elections to the United Nations Security Council for the term of 2026–2027.

Carry the voice of the Iranians' as she stands in front of riot police during a demonstration in support of Iranian protesters in Paris on September 25, 2022. Protests flared again in Iran on September 24, 2022 over the death of a woman in morality police custody, despite a crackdown by security forces in which at least 41 people have died, according to official figures. (Photo: AFP)

PARIS, France (AFP) — Iranians took to the streets for a 10th consecutive night Sunday, defying a warning from the judiciary to protest the death of young Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in morality police custody.

At least 41 people have died since the unrest began, mostly protesters but including members of the Islamic republic's security forces, according to an official toll, although other sources say the real figure is higher.

Oslo-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) on Sunday evening said the death toll was at least 57, but noted that ongoing Internet blackouts were making it increasingly difficult to confirm fatalities in a context where the women-led protests have spread to scores of cities.

Echoing an earlier warning by President Ebrahim Raisi, judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei on Sunday ""emphasised the need for decisive action without leniency"" against the core instigators of the ""riots"", the judiciary's Mizan Online website said.

Hundreds of demonstrators, reformist activists and journalists have been arrested amid the mostly night-time demonstrations since unrest first broke out after Amini's death on September 16.

Amini, whose Kurdish first name was Jhina, was detained three days before that for allegedly breaching rules mandating tightly-fitted hijab head coverings and which ban, among other things, ripped jeans and brightly coloured clothes.

Images circulated by IHR showed protesters on the streets of Tehran, shouting ""Death to the dictator"", purportedly after nightfall on Sunday.

Witnesses told AFP that protests were ongoing in several locations. Video footage showed demonstrations in Tabriz and Shiraz, among other places, with women removing their headscarves and protesters shouting against the authorities.

Iran's largest protests in almost three years have seen security forces fire live rounds and bird shot, rights groups charge, while protesters have hurled rocks, torched police cars and set ablaze State buildings.

Some women protesters have burnt their hijabs in the rallies and cut off their hair, some dancing near large bonfires to the applause of crowds that have chanted ""Zan, zendegi, azadi"" or ""Woman, life, freedom"".

Video of demonstrations on Saturday, verified by AFP, showed students ripping down a picture of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei outside a university in the northern province of Mazandaran.

Protests abroad have been held in solidarity with Iranian women in Athens, Berlin, Brussels, Istanbul, Madrid, New York and Paris, among other cities.

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell deplored the security forces' response to the unrest as ""disproportionate... unjustifiable and unacceptable"".

Iran, which has been hit with tough economic sanctions over its nuclear programme, has blamed ""foreign plots"" for the unrest.

Iran's foreign ministry said Sunday it had summoned Britain's ambassador over what it described as an ""invitation to riots"" by Farsi-speaking media based in London, and Norway's envoy over ""unconstructive comments"" made by his country's Parliament speaker."
1064754029,20220926,"Military-aged Russians have poured into Georgia by cars in a column stretching for some 20 kilometres, by bicycles and some even by foot

Kazbegi (Georgia) (AFP) – Nikita spent two days in traffic before he made it to Georgia, one of the thousands of Russian men seeking to evade the Ukraine war draft.

The latest wave of Russian exiles since the war began in February has seen military-aged men pour into the Caucasus country -- by cars in a column stretching for some 20 kilometres, by bicycles and some walking kilometres by foot to the border crossing.

""I have no choice but to flee Russia,"" Nikita told AFP standing outside the Georgian side of the Kazbegi border crossing in a narrow rocky ravine.

""Why on earth would I need to go to that crazy war?"" the 23-year-old added ""I am no cannon fodder. I am not a murderer,"" he said as a vulture circled overhead, high in the clear sky.

Like the majority of men who talked to AFP, he declined to give his last name fearing retribution.

Denis, 38, said: ""Our president wants to drag all of us in the fratricidal war, which he declared on totally illegitimate grounds.""

""I want to escape,"" he said with a sad smile. ""To me, this is not a nice Georgia holiday, this is an emigration.""

Alexander Sudakov, a 32-year-old production manager, said ""The mobilisation was the final straw"" to him after twenty years of living under President Vladimir Putin's increasingly authoritarian rule.

""Ukrainians are our brothers, I don't understand, how could I go there to kill them, or to be killed.""

He said Georgia was the top choice for those fleeing the draft because Russians can enter and stay up to a year without a visa.

He said he would mull seeking asylum in a European Union country once his wife and baby son, whom he left behind in his native Saint Petersburg, join him.

The influx of Russian immigrants has sparked mixed feelings in a country where painful memories of Russia's 2008 invasion are still fresh.

The five-day war left Georgia partitioned, with Russian troops stationed in its two separatist regions which the Kremlin recognised as independent after the EU brokered a ceasefire.

Nearly 50,000 Russians have fled to Georgia over the first four months of the war, the tiny Black Sea nation's statistics office said in June.

Some 40,000 more fled over the same period to Armenia, another top destination that also has no visa requirement for Russians.

On Saturday, Russian authorities acknowledged for the first time that there was a significant outflow of travellers from the country.

The local interior ministry in a Russian region that borders Georgia said there was a congestion of around 2,300 cars waiting to reach the border.

The ministry urged people ""to refrain from travelling"" in the direction of Georgia, saying the movement towards the checkpoint was ""difficult"" and that additional traffic officers had been deployed.

But Nikita said ""wild corruption"" was to blame for the traffic jam.

He said police periodically closed traffic and artificially created congestion ""to extort money from desperate people.""

""It takes currently up to three days to drive 20 kilometres to the Georgian border, but if you pay the police a bribe, then it's a matter of just several hours, they would escort you to the border,"" he said, adding that he knew cases where people paid hundreds of dollars.

Alexander said he paid police $1,200 and it still took him some 30 hours to reach the Georgian border.

Nikita said the wave of Russian emigration seen so far was just a beginning of a mass exodus.

""Millions will follow, nobody wants to go to this war -- even those Russians who are poisoned by government propaganda and like the idea of Russia again becoming the dominatrix on the post-Soviet space.""

Igor, 32, is one of such people.

""I am a patriot, I support Putin and the special military operation in Ukraine,"" the 32-year-old IT specialist said.

""But personally, I can't go to the war because I am the sole breadwinner in the family and I've got that bloody mortgage.""

He said he plans to work remotely for a Russian IT company from Georgia, but will be forced to return to Russia when his passport expires in six months.

""I'll be alive for another six months, until March, that's all I know for sure."""

Domicile, legal form, LEI, jurisdiction of incorporation and country of operation The Issuer is incorporated in Ireland with its registered address in Ireland and its legal entity identifier is 549300FXP9JMVJDIO346. The Issuer was registered and incorporated in Ireland as a public company limited by shares on 21 May 2018 under the laws of Ireland, registration number 627079. The Issuer has been established as a special purpose vehicle for the purpose of issuing asset backed securities. The Issuer has an authorised share capital of €1,000,000. The Issuer has issued 25,000 ordinary shares, all of which are fully paid. All of the issued ordinary shares of the Issuer are held by Wilmington Trust SP Services (Dublin) Limited on trust for charitable purposes. What is the key financial information regarding the Issuer? The Issuer has most recently prepared audited financial statements for (i) the period from 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020 and (ii) the period from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021. The financial year of the Issuer ends on 30 September. Such financial statements are incorporated by reference into and shall form part of the Base Prospectus, and are available from the registered office of the Issuer. A summary of the key financial information of the Issuer is set out below: What are the key risks that are specific to the Issuer? The Issuer is a special purpose vehicle with no assets other than its paid-up share capital, and the assets on which the ETC Securities are secured. C. KEY INFORMATION ON THE SECURITIES What are the main features of the ETC Securities? Currency, denomination, par value, number of securities issued and duration The ETC Securities are denominated in Euro (the ""Specified Currency""). The ETC Securities are in bearer global form. The scheduled maturity date (the ""Scheduled Maturity Date"") of the ETC Securities is 21 May 2080. As at the issue date of the above tranche of ETC Securities, there will be 26,598,841 ETC Securities of the Series in issue. The ETC Securities do not have a denomination but are treated by the Issuer as having a denomination of less than €100,000. Rights attached to the ETC Securities The ETC Securities are designed to provide investors with exposure to a metal without having to take physical delivery of the metal. The underlying ""Metal"" for the ETC Securities is: gold. Each ETC Security relates to a specific amount in weight of Metal, specified in the Final Terms, known as the ""Metal Entitlement per ETC Security"". On any particular day, the ETC Security can be viewed as giving an exposure to that ------amount of Metal as the amount payable in respect of each ETC Security and the value per ETC Security (the ""Value per ETC Security"") is linked to the value of the Metal, subject to an adjustment for any foreign exchange gains or losses between the Metal Currency (as defined below) and the Specified Currency. In order to back its obligations under the ETC Securities, the Issuer will seek to hold enough Metal to meet its obligations under the ETC Securities. The precise amount it holds at any time may be more or less than the aggregate amount of the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security to reflect the periodic payment of product fees and an adjustment for any foreign exchange gains or losses. The proceeds from the disposal of the underlying Metal, plus any interest received on the proceeds of such disposal less any negative interest, net of any deductions (and converted into the Specified Currency at the rate the Metal Agent determines would be obtainable at the time of conversion which shall be on or about the day of such sale (or, if such day is not an FX business day, the immediately following FX business day, and which may take into account a bid/offer spread quoted by a dealer), will equal the amount due under the ETC Securities (subject to certain minimum amounts owed). The Metal will be held for the Issuer by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (or any successor or replacement) (the ""Secured Account Custodian"") and will be generally held on an ""allocated"" basis. This means that specifically identifiable physical items of the Metal are allocated to the Issuer and are segregated from metal held for other clients of the custodian. However, for operational purposes, small amounts of Metal may be held on an ""unallocated"" basis. This means that the Secured Account Custodian maintains an account in the name of the Issuer which shows them as being entitled to delivery of a particular amount of the Metal but without specific physical metal having been identified. Where Metal is held on an ""unallocated"" basis the right to delivery is a purely contractual right and, as such, the Issuer is an unsecured creditor of the custodian and is exposed to the credit risk of the custodian. The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and any underlying Metal. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as ""Secured Property"" for this Series. Securityholders will not, by reason of holding such Series, have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities. The security will become enforceable if payment of the redemption amount in respect of such ETC Securities is not made when due on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the Scheduled Early Redemption Date (defined below) (if applicable). On the Scheduled Maturity Date, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Final Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Final Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount (defined below) and (ii) 10 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security as at the series issue date (the ""Minimum Debt Principal Amount "") plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Final Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Final Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the volume-weighted average prices per metal unit at which the Metal Agent (defined below) is able to sell the underlying Metal (""Average Metal Sale Price"") during the Final Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Final Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Final Redemption Valuation Date. ""Final Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date specified in the Final Terms or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. ""Specified Interest Amount"" is the amount of interest per ETC Security equal to that ETC Security's pro rata share of the amount of interest which has accrued (if any) on the proceeds of realisation of the underlying Metal deposited into the Series Cash Account (defined below) during or relating to the relevant redemption disposal period. Whilst interest may accrue at a positive, zero or negative rate on the Series Cash Account, the Specified Interest Amount is subject to a minimum of zero and any negative interest shall instead be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the underlying Metal. If any of the early redemption events occur, each ETC Security will become due and payable at an amount (the ""Early Redemption Amount"") equal to the greater of (i) the Early Metal Redemption Amount (defined below) plus the Specified Interest Amount and (ii) the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount. The ""Early Metal Redemption Amount"" is determined by multiplying (i) the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security as at the Early Redemption Valuation Date (defined below); and (ii) the Average Metal Sale Price during the Early Redemption Disposal Period (defined below). The ""Early Redemption Disposal Period"" is the period which lasts for the number of days specified in the Final Terms, which shall start from (but exclude) the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the Early Redemption Valuation Date, save where the Issuer has suspended the determination of the value and Metal Entitlement per ETC Security and no replacement Series Counterparty is appointed, in which case the date falling four non-disrupted business days following the end of such suspension period. The ""Scheduled Early Redemption Date"" is the 8th business day following the Early Redemption Disposal Period. The ""Early Redemption Valuation Date"" is the date of the occurrence of an early redemption event or the date on which the Trustee gives notice that, due to the occurrence of an event of default, the ETC Securities shall become due and payable at their Early Redemption Amount on the Scheduled Early Redemption Date, or, if such day is not a business day, the next following business day. There can be no assurance that the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, will be greater than or equal to the amount invested by any securityholder. If the Final Metal Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, plus the Specified Interest Amount falls below the Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount, then due to the limited recourse nature of the ETC Securities, securityholders are unlikely to receive payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, in full and may receive zero. The Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount per ETC Security, as applicable, will be determined by reference to the Average Metal Sale Price of the underlying Metal held in respect of the ETC Securities sold during the Final Redemption Disposal Period or Early Redemption Disposal Period, as applicable, by JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (or any successor or replacement) as ""Metal Agent"", net of associated deductions and taxes. The Issuer will, on or prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date or Scheduled Early Redemption Date, publish the determination of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, (which shall include publication of the price, volume and date of each sale of underlying Metal during the relevant redemption disposal period, including information on any fees, deductions and/or taxes imposed on such sale, and the determination of the Average Metal Sale Price) on the website maintained on behalf of the Issuer at www.etf.dws.com (or such other website notified by the Issuer for the ETC Securities from time to time). The Metal Agent will pay the aggregate proceeds of such disposals (converted, if necessary, into the currency of the ETC Securities) to the cash account for the Series (the ""Series Cash Account"") maintained by J.P. Morgan SE as ""Account Bank"" as directed by the Programme Administrator (defined below). The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest. On early or final redemption of the ETC Securities, a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security, as the case may be. The foreign exchange hedge seeks to reduce the exposure of the ETC Securities to exchange rate fluctuations between the currency in which the ETC Securities are denominated and the currency in which the Metal is quoted. The currency in which the Metal is quoted is known as the ""Metal Currency"". It does this by reflecting the effect of a notional forward sale of the Metal Currency and a corresponding forward purchase of the currency in which the ETC Securities are denominated. The foreign exchange hedge may result in gains or losses to the Issuer. Such gains or losses will result in an increase or decrease in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security and will therefore impact the Value per ETC Security. The Metal Currency for the Series is: U.S. dollar. The foreign exchange hedge is entered into by the Issuer with J.P. Morgan SE as the ""Series Counterparty"". In such role, it enters into a balancing agreement with the Issuer in relation to the ETC Securities (the ""Balancing Agreement"") which provides for deliveries of metal to or by the Issuer to reflect an adjustment for any foreign exchange gain or loss realised by the Issuer. Where there are foreign exchange gains and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security consequently increases, the Series Counterparty will deliver additional Metal equivalent to such increase. Where there are losses and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security consequently decreases, the Issuer will be required to deliver Metal equivalent to such decrease to the Series Counterparty under the Balancing Agreement. All such payments will be in the form of Metal and will settle no later than the second business day after the relevant valuation day. The ETC Securities are subject to a product fee that accrues on a daily basis. Accrued product fee is paid by a daily reduction in the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security which, as a result of such reduction, operates as a charge on securityholders. The Issuer will, using the Metal Agent, periodically realise Metal equal to such charge and the proceeds will be credited to the Series Cash Account maintained by the Account Bank in relation to the ETC Securities and used by the Issuer to pay the product fee to the Programme Administrator in accordance with the Programme Administrator Agreement . Such realisation will happen on a periodic (typically weekly) basis. The Programme Administrator Agreement provides that the Programme Administrator will use the product fee in relation to each Series of ETC Securities to pay on behalf of the Issuer the costs of the Programme (as set out in the Schedule to the Programme Administrator Agreement) relating to such Series of ETC Securities and the Issuer more generally. The ETC Securities may become due and payable prior to their Scheduled Maturity Date in connection with the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) certain legal or regulatory changes occur in relation to the Issuer and the Issuer gives a notice of redemption; (ii) the Balancing Agreement is terminated in connection with an event of default, a termination event or the valid delivery of an optional termination notice under such Balancing Agreement (and to the extent the optional termination notice is delivered by the Series Counterparty, no replacement is put in place (as discussed further below under ""Optional Termination"")); (iii) any agent in relation to the ETC Securities resigns or their appointment is terminated and the Issuer gives notice that no successor or replacement has been appointed within a 60 calendar day period; (iv) the Value per ETC Security is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price as at the series issue date for two consecutive valuation days and the determination agent gives the relevant notice; (v) the Issuer will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, be required to make a payment in respect of VAT or be required to account for VAT in respect of a delivery of Metal from or to an authorised participant (whether or not such VAT is recoverable); (vi) an Issuer Call Redemption Event occurs (as discussed further below under ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""); (vii) the Issuer becomes entitled to serve a VAT redemption event notice or a termination notice under the Balancing Agreement following a tax event or illegality under the Balancing Agreement and the Trustee gives the relevant notice as directed by the requisite number of securityholders; or (viii) an event of default occurs under the ETC Securities. These include certain breaches by the Issuer of its obligations that are not cured within the applicable cure period and certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer. The Issuer may elect to redeem the ETC Securities early on giving not less than 30 calendar days' notice to securityholders (an ""Issuer Call Redemption Event""). The Issuer or the Series Counterparty may, on giving not less than 30 calendar days' prior notice, terminate the Balancing Agreement. Termination of the Balancing Agreement may result in an early redemption of the ETC Securities if such notice is given by the Issuer, or, in respect of an optional termination notice validly delivered by the Series Counterparty, a replacement Series Counterparty is not appointed within the time specified the terms and conditions. The ETC Securities will rank equally amongst themselves. The rights of securityholders are limited in recourse to the Secured Property. As such, once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed, none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors, officers, members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and, therefore, the rights of securityholders will rank in accordance therewith. As a result of such provisions, the securityholders may not receive in full the final redemption amount or early redemption amount payable in respect of an ETC Security. All payments in respect of the ETC Securities shall be made net of and after allowance for any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes. In the event that any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes applies to payments in respect of the ETC Securities, securityholders will be subject to such tax or deduction and shall not be entitled to receive amounts to compensate for any such tax or deduction. No event of default will occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction. The ETC Securities will be governed by the laws of Ireland. There will be two security deeds relating to the ETC Securities; one will be governed by the laws of Ireland and the other will be governed by English law. Rank of the ETC Securities in the Issuer's capital structure upon insolvency The ETC Securities are secured, limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and the ETC Securities rank equally amongst themselves. The Issuer's obligations thereunder are secured over the underlying Metal and over the rights of the Issuer under the main agreements entered into by it for the ETC Securities. Such security will become enforceable if payment of the redemption amount is not made when due or if the Issuer becomes insolvent. Restrictions on free transferability of the securities Interests in ETC Securities traded in any clearing system will be transferred in accordance with the procedures and regulations of that clearing system. The ETC Securities will be freely transferable. Investors should note that the ETC Securities have not been, nor will be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") or under the securities law of any state or political sub-division of the United States of America or any of its territories, possessions or other areas subject to its jurisdiction including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The ETC Securities include ETC Securities in bearer form that are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. No person has registered nor will register as a commodity pool operator of the Issuer under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the ""CEA"") and the rules thereunder (the ""CFTC Rules"") of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the ""CFTC""). Any offer or sale of the ETC Securities must be made in an offshore transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Regulation S thereunder (""Regulation S""). The Issuer has imposed a selling restriction on the authorised participants and any other Authorised Offerors (defined below) that the ETC Securities may not at any time be offered, sold or otherwise transferred in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, persons who are either (A) U.S. Persons as defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act or (B) persons who do not come within the definition of a Non-United States person under CFTC Rule 4.7 (excluding for the purposes of sub-section (D) thereof, the exception to the extent it would apply to persons who are not non-United States persons). Where will the ETC Securities be traded? Application has been made for the ETC Securities to be admitted to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana and for the ETC Securities to be admitted to trading on the regulated markets and/or other main market(s) thereof with effect from or around the series issue date. What are the key risks that are specific to the ETC Securities? · The amount payable in respect of the ETC Securities is linked to the performance of the underlying Metal. Prices of precious metals are generally more volatile than prices in other asset classes. If the value of such underlying Metal falls, that will reduce amounts payable in respect of the ETC Securities. · The Value per ETC Security, secondary market price and the redemption amount of ETC Securities will primarily be affected by the performance and level of the underlying Metal, rate movements, market perception, the performance and price of foreign exchange futures contracts, the creditworthiness of the Metal Agent and the Series Counterparty, the creditworthiness of the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian and any applicable sub-custodian and liquidity in the ETC Securities. · The foreign exchange hedge does not fully eliminate exchange rate risks or fluctuations and, depending on movements in exchange rates, such currency hedging might have a negative impact on the Value per ETC Security. · The securityholders and other transaction parties will have recourse only to the Secured Property in respect of the ETC Securities and not to any other assets of the Issuer. If, following realisation in full of the Secured Property relating to the ETC Securities, any outstanding claim remains unpaid, then such claim will be extinguished and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect thereof. · The Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is subject to the deduction of the product fee and to any gains or losses incurred by the Issuer in connection with the foreign exchange hedging component. · The Minimum Debt Principal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount (if any) operates as a minimum repayment amount on the early or final redemption of the ETC Securities. However, in the event that the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is insufficient to fund the Minimum Debt Principal Amount payable in respect of each ETC Security to all securityholders on such early or final redemption, such securityholders may not receive payment of the Minimum Debt Principal Amount in full and may receive substantially less. · The Issuer and securityholders are exposed to the credit risk of the Metal Agent, the Programme Administrator (defined below), the Series Counterparty, the Secured Account Custodian, the subscription account custodian, the Account Bank, and any sub-custodian and the authorised participants. · Any disruption to a price source or relevant association may affect the Value per ETC Security and the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security. · Certain events may lead to an early redemption of the ETC Securities. · ETC Securities may have a long term and the only means through which an investor can realise value from an ETC Security prior to its Scheduled Maturity Date is to sell it at its then market price in a secondary market transaction. While each authorised participant may make a market for the ETC Securities, no authorised participant is obliged to make a market for any series of ETC Securities and an authorised participant may discontinue making a market at any time. Furthermore, any market in ETC Securities may not be liquid and the secondary market price (if any) for ETC Securities may be substantially less than the price paid by the investor. · With respect to any redemption disposal period, if the proceeds from the realisation of the underlying Metal would cause the balance standing to the Series Cash Account to exceed the maximum amount that can be held during the period between December and January of each calendar year (such amount and such period to be agreed from time to time between the Issuer, the Programme Administrator and the Account Bank (the ""Year-End Period"")), then the Programme Administrator may postpone the redemption date until after the Year-End Period, during which time the Metal Agent will not deposit such proceeds into the Series Cash Account and interest equal to the Specified Interest Amount will not accrue on such proceeds for so long as they are not deposited into the Series Cash Account. D. KEY INFORMATION ON THE ADMISSION TO TRADING ON A REGULATED MARKET Under which conditions and timetable can I invest in this security? Upon initial issue, the ETC Securities are being made available by the Issuer for subscription only to entities (the ""Authorised Participants"") allowed to buy and sell ETC Securities directly from and to the Issuer pursuant an authorised participant agreement with the Issuer. Authorised Participants will pay for any such subscriptions by delivering Metal equal to the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security of the ETC Securities being subscribed. Authorised Participants may also act as market makers, i.e. they buy and sell ETC Securities from and to investors on an over-the-counter basis or via a stock exchange. However, not all market makers need to be Authorised Participants. Any offer or sale of ETC Securities to an investor by an Authorised Participant or other distributor or broker authorised to use the Base Prospectus (each, an ""Authorised Offeror"") will be made in accordance with any terms and other arrangements in place between such Authorised Offeror and such investor including as to price, allocations and settlement arrangements. It will be the responsibility of the applicable financial intermediary at the time of such offer to provide the investor with that information and neither the Issuer nor any other person has any responsibility or liability for such information. Why has the prospectus been produced? Reason for the offer and use of proceeds The ETC securities are designed to provide investors with exposure to the underlying Metal without having to take physical delivery of the Metal and to reduce the exposure of the ETC Securities to exchange rate fluctuations between the Specified Currency and the Metal Currency. The net proceeds from the issue of this tranche of ETC Securities will be an amount of unallocated Metal which, in accordance with the custody agreement for secured accounts will, to the extent possible, be allocated to physical metal bars or other metal shapes and be held in the secured allocated account. Any remaining Metal shall be held in the secured unallocated account. Such underlying Metal shall be used to meet the Issuer's obligations under the ETC Securities and the Balancing Agreement. Material conflicts of interest pertaining to the offer or admission to trading As at the date of the Base Prospectus, DWS International GmbH is the ""Programme Administrator"". However, in connection with ongoing or future restructuring and/or reorganisations within the DWS group, it is possible that some of the roles currently performed by DWS International GmbH may be novated, delegated or otherwise transferred to a different entity within the DWS group without the prior written consent of securityholders or the Trustee, provided that it is legally permitted to make such novation, delegation or transfer. DWS International GmbH acting through any of its branches or affiliates may also be an Authorised Participant in relation to a series of ETC Securities. DWS International GmbH has been, or may be, appointed to act as a distributing entity in respect of the ETC Securities. Where DWS International GmbH also acts as a distributing entity on behalf of other products, it may lead DWS International GmbH to prefer the execution of placement business in respect of those other products. The Programme Administrator has certain discretions to adjust the levels of the Base Fee Percentage and the FX Hedging Fee Percentage from time to time (and, therefore, the Product Fee Percentage and the Product Fee). This may potentially result in higher fees being applied which would reduce the return for Securityholders. Subject always to their regulatory obligations in performing each or any of these roles, DWS entities do not act on behalf of, or accept any duty of care or any fiduciary duty to, any Securityholder. Each relevant DWS entity will pursue actions and take steps that it deems appropriate to protect its interests without regard to the consequences for the purchasers of the ETC Securities or any other person. A DWS entity and/or its affiliates may engage in trading and market-making activities and may hold long or short positions in any metal, other instruments or derivative products based on or related to the metal, metal for their proprietary accounts or for other accounts under their management. DWS entities may also issue securities or enter into financial instruments in relation to any metal. To the extent that any DWS entity, directly or through its affiliates, serves as issuer, agent, manager, sponsor or underwriter of such securities or other instruments, its interests with respect to such products may be adverse to those of the securityholders. Such activities may have an adverse effect on the Value per ETC Security and/or the value of the underlying Metal relating to the ETC Securities.

""Romania and Japan have a duty to continue all the political and business projects they have started. That is the message I sent to the Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, during the meeting I and Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca had with him. The most important objective is to succeed in speeding up making formal the strategic partnership between our two countries, a solid partnership based on four main directions: politics, security, economy, and culture and science. I am convinced that this partnership will strengthen the direction of Romania to be a strong and credible partner of Japan, both in advancing bilateral relations and in terms of its ties with NATO and the European Union,"" Ciolacu wrote on Facebook, told Agerpres.

He told Kishida that he would like one of the stations that will make up the future Bucharest subway line to Otopeni to bear the name of late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, ""as a sign of respect and gratitude for the intense efforts he has made to over time in the consolidation of relations between Romania and Japan.""

""Furthermore, I welcomed Prime Minister Kishida's message of unity regarding the need for democratic states that share common values and visions to act in one voice internationally to give a strong and firm retort to all those who dare disregard peace, democracy and freedom,"" Ciolacu said.

1064771872,20220926,"September 26, 2022 [RIGZONE] – The Netherlands is purchasing millions of barrels of diesel in preparation for what is set to be a winter like no other.

The country’s petroleum stockpiling agency, COVA, has issued tenders seeking more than three million barrels of diesel for delivery before the end of the year, with potentially more to come. That comes as the European Union prepares to cut-off seaborne supplies from Russia, amid a broader energy crunch.

Earlier this year, the Netherlands was part of a globally coordinated release of crude and oil products in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and sold about 180,000 tons of diesel from its strategic inventories. Now, the Dutch government wants to rebuild its diesel stockpiles, requiring the replacement of barrels previously sold, along with millions more.

The decision to boost stockpiles is in preparation for both winter and the forthcoming EU sanctions, according to a person familiar with the matter. COVA was asked by the Dutch government to restore the volumes that were distributed in April-May and boost inventories, if possible, to do so without disturbing markets, the person said. The Dutch government declined to comment.

From early February, almost all seaborne cargoes into the bloc from Russia — still the continent’s biggest external supplier — will be banned. That will clash with Europe’s consumption of diesel-type heating fuel surging in the coldest months of the year. This year, there’s also the added pressure of so-called gas-to-oil switching, whereby businesses burn diesel and other fuels instead of costly natural gas.

COVA has been instructed by the government to return its stocks to the original levels, according to a statement on its website. The agency also has been told to expand temporarily its diesel holdings by 500,000 tons — enough to supply the whole of Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, for almost four days.

1064779299,20220926,"In a recent landmark ruling, the African Court denounced the Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara as a serious violation of the right to self-determination.

BIR LEHLOU, WESTERN SAHARA, September 26, 2022 / EINPresswire.com / -- On 22 September 2022, the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights issued a landmark ruling, unprecedented on the African continent, condemning the illegal presence of Moroccan forces in Western Sahara as a military occupation, in violation of international law.This was the first time that the Court had dealt with a case dealing with the right to self-determination and independence, and the Court gave full importance to this principle which has been a constituent part of states in Africa, as part of the vast decolonisation movement.The Court considers that this right, enshrined in Article 20 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, constitutes a peremptory norm of international law, falling within the scope of jus cogens, which does not tolerate any derogation. This entails an obligation erga omnes for all states not to recognise a situation created in violation of this right. Similarly, States must assist oppressed peoples. In this regard, they must refrain from any act incompatible with the nature of the right to self-determination or the full enjoyment of this right by the peoples concerned.Having established this principle, the Court ruled that “both the UN and the AU recognise the situation of the SADR as one of occupation and consider its territory as one of those territories whose decolonisation process is not yet fully completed”. This is why direct negotiations between the two AU members SADR and Morocco should be concluded, with the sole purpose of “organising a referendum to guarantee the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara”.From this reality, which is obvious to all, the Court finds that the Moroccan occupation of part of the territory of the SADR seriously violates the right to self-determination and independence of the Sahrawi people. Consequently, the Court finds, AU Member States have an obligation to assist the Sahrawi people in the realisation of their right to self-determination and not to recognise the situation and violations resulting from this illegal occupation.Indeed, the right to self-determination and independence “imposes an international obligation on all States Parties to take positive steps to realise this right, including assisting oppressed peoples in their struggle for freedom and refraining from actions incompatible with the nature or the full enjoyment of this right. The Court emphasises that “in view of the fact that part of the territory of SADR is still occupied by Morocco, there is no doubt that the States Parties to the Charter have an obligation, individually and collectively, towards the people of SADR to protect their right to self-determination, in particular by assisting them in their struggle for freedom and by not recognising the Moroccan occupation and any violation of human rights which may have resulted from that occupation”.The Court concludes that the admission of the Kingdom of Morocco to the African Union does not confer any legality on the occupation of Western Sahara, and on the serious violations of fundamental rights required by its maintenance. Indeed, the Kingdom of Morocco made no reservation in Article 4(b) of the Constitutive Act as to “respect for the inherited borders existing at the time of accession to independence”. Consequently, having been admitted within its internationally recognised borders, excluding Sahrawi territory, the Kingdom of Morocco sits in the continental organisation alongside the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, which is a founding member of the African Union.The Court concludes, “all AU member states have a responsibility under international law to find a permanent solution to the occupation and to ensure the enjoyment of the right to self-determination of the Sahrawi people and to do nothing that would recognise such occupation as legitimate or impede the enjoyment of that right.”Femi Falana SAN represented the Applicant, Bernard Anbataayela Mornah, a Ghanaian national and National Chairman of Convention of People’s Party of Ghana who filed the case on behalf of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.Quoting Dr Femi Falana SAN, who represented the Applicant in this case: ""With this epochal judgment the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights has joined the International Court of Justice and the Court of Justice of the European Union in giving judicial endorsement to the right of the people of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic to independence and self-determination. No doubt, the judgment of the African Court has denounced the illegal occupation of the territory of Western Sahara by the Kingdom of Morocco. It is particularly gratifying to note the Court has reminded the members of the African Union of their legal obligation under international law to find a permanent solution to the illegal occupation of the territory and to ensure the enjoyment of the right to self-determination of the Sahrawi people and to do nothing that would recognise such occupation as legitimate or impede the enjoyment of that right.Therefore, Morocco and its few allies in the African Union and the members of the European Union as well as the Governments of United States must adopt urgent measures to comply with the judgment of the African Court by according recognition to the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic without any delay.""The Respondents' States were represented by the following lawyers:1.

1064779302,20220926,"(Yicai Global) Sept. 26 -- China’s Hello Tech Energy has secured a large order for portable solar energy storage units from Lidl Stiftung, the German discount store chain operator. Its shares rose.

Hello Tech’s German unit will supply Lidl with Jackery-branded products to sell online and in its stores across Europe, the Shenzhen-based company said on Sept. 23. The units are small solar energy storage devices used to supply electricity outdoors and when power to homes fails, according to the firm’s website.

Demand for China-made portable generators and power stations has soared as Europe faces an energy shortage this winter due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Twenty-seven European Union countries imported 1.3 million electric blankets from China in July, up nearly 150 percent from the previous month, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs.

Lidl has about 12,000 stores and over 300 logistics centers in 31 countries, Hello Tech noted, adding that the deal will help the Chinese supplier expand its sales channels and raise its market share in Europe.

Shares of Hello Tech [SHE: 301327] closed 0.7 percent up at CNY232.22 (USD32.47) each today, after jumping as much as 4.9 percent in the morning. The stock landed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Sept. 19 priced at CNY237.50.

Net profit at Hello Tech rose 2.2 percent to CNY160 million (USD22.3 million) in the six months ended June 30 from a year earlier on a 36 percent jump in revenue to CNY1.3 billion (USD181.5 million), per its latest earnings report."

 “We call on the Iranian authorities to allow peaceful protests and to not deploy further violence — in particular not fatal violence — against protesters,” the ministry said on Twitter. “We also communicated that directly to the Iranian ambassador in Berlin today.”

 Asked about the possibility of further sanctions on Tehran in response to the violence, a ministry spokesperson had earlier said, “we will consider all options” with other European Union states.

 Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on Iran’s morality police over allegations of abuse of Iranian women. Washington said it held the unit responsible for the Sept. 16 death of the 22-year-old Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini after she was detained by morality police enforcing the Islamic Republic’s strict restrictions on women’s dress."

As a result of the cooperation between Acba bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) USD 25 million will be directed at the development of Armenia’s economy through financing micro, small and medium enterprises, as well as companies led by women. Financing will be provided via Armenian drams or U.S. dollars.

Acba bank has attracted around USD 7 million from the mentioned funds in the framework of EU4Business-EBRD credit line program. Thanks to this, the bank will help the local companies increase their competitiveness through raising the quality of their products and services, as well as making investments in ""green"" technologies. European Union will also provide incentive grants and free technical support to sub-borrowers in the framework of EU4Business initiative. As part of the US$ 25 million financial package, US$ 4 million will fall under the Women in Business (WiB) programme that promotes women’s participation in business and it supported by the EU. Frank Hess, Head of Cooperation of the Delegation of the European Union to Armenia, attended the signing ceremony.

“Acba bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have a rich history of cooperation. We have started our strong partnership with EBRD in 2003. Now we are signing new financing agreements of USD 25 million, and a part of it is in local currency. With these resources Acba bank will finance Armenian SMEs and the business will receive an opportunity to involve necessary technology and equipment corresponding to EU standards. Fostering women entrepreneurship is an important component of the program”, mentioned the CEO of Acba bank Hakob Andreasyan.

“Acba bank is a vital partner for us in Armeina. We are proud for our nearly 20-year-long cooperation. We want to create new opportunities for the development of SMEs in Armenia; it is also important to support the companies lead by women. We will continue supporting the private sector of the economy and fostering the development of Armenia. We are grateful to the European Union for the cooperation, for contributing to the financing process. Apart from all this, I would also like to congratulate Acba Bank for conducting an initial public offering of its shares in the local market. This was very important both for the development of the bank and for the country's economy,"" said EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso.”

Acba bank is one of the leaders of the Armenian banking system, the absolute leader in financing the country's agricultural sector. After the initial public offering (IPO) in 2021, Acba Bank has more than 5,200 shareholders. Thanks to the implementation of the latest digital solutions, as well as the use of new technologies, the bank continuously develops the quantity and quality of the provided financial services.

1064789272,20220926,"The mobilisation of 300,000 reservists, referenda in occupied territories and a nuclear threat are the three cards Vladimir Putin has just pulled out of his hand to create a new status quo in the war in Ukraine. By “escaping forward” he is undoubtedly attempting to avoid military defeat on the front lines and a brewing crisis within the country.

Putin’s sudden turnaround has come as a result of intense pressure from both inside and outside. The so-called party of war, or siloviki (members of the army and security services), for months has been urging popular mobilisation. They claim that enacting it is the only way Russia will manage to stop the Ukrainian counteroffensive and avoid losing the war. Even more radical criticism came from the “ultra-patriots” camp, which include veteran circles, Russian neo-Nazis and fascist groups fighting in Donbas (such as the Rusich group and the Russian Imperial Legion). The loudest of such voices has been the vociferous Igor Girkin (aka Strelkov) who is among the four accused over the downing of the MH17 Malaysian Airliner in 2014. The “ultra-patriots” have demanded punishment for the frontline defeats of the corrupt generals and for the army’s abysmal equipment. They even accuse Putin himself for meddling in military decisions. In their eyes, Putin, despite being the commander-in-chief, is merely a former officer of the civilian FSB. From their perspective as military experts, the attack on Kyiv was an unnecessary operation imposed by a politician.

Furthermore, the Russian society, which for years has been inundated and inspired by imperial ideology and superpower resentment, expects more success from the Kremlin. Yet unlike in the 2014 annexation of Crimea, this time will not be so easy to seize the so-called Novorossiya. The invasion, which was supposed to last three days, at worst a week, and finish with a victory parade in the centre of Kyiv has been taking place for more than six months and has managed to disgrace the Russian army. The myth of the world’s second military power, which turned out to be an army that murders and rapes civilians (Bucha, Irpin and others), with fatally low morale, has been exposed. Therefore, Putin felt forced to placate the domestic mood, both the ultranationalist critics and the general population – fearful of popular mobilisation at the same time demanding victory.

Likewise, pressure has been growing from Russia’s foreign partners who have so far kept their distance from the war. During the Shanghai East Cooperation Organisation summit held in Samarkand on September 15th and 16th, Putin heard from his “allies” concerns about the war’s consequences for energy security, food supplies, foreign trade and the continued growth of the global economy. Chinese leader Xi Jin Ping expressed “several questions and concerns”, while the prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, put it bluntly: “This is not the time for war!”

Lastly, the Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine alarmed the Kremlin that if Russia does not hold referenda immediately in the territories conquered by Russia after February 24th to annex them to the Russian Federation, there will be nothing soon to annex.

Just a day before Putin’s announcement on mobilisation, the Kremlin adopted a plan for referenda on September 23rd-27th in parts of the four occupied Ukrainian territories, namely the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, as well as parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Their outcome was expected to be similar to the support of locals announced by a poll delivered by the Crimean RIPSI institute – 94 per cent in the so-called DNR; 93 per cent in the so-called LNR; 87 per cent in the Zaporizhzhia region and 80 per cent in Kherson. By annexing another 15 per cent of sovereign Ukraine, Putin anticipates two important outcomes. First is the ability to satisfy public expectations through further territorial conquest. The 2014 annexation of Crimea propelled public support for Putin to a record high of 87 per cent.

Second, Putin expects that the new red lines outlined in his announcement would be respected by Ukraine and the West. Certainly Putin believes the Ukrainian army will refrain from a counteroffensive in the annexed territories, a significant miscalculation based on past experience. Today neither Kyiv nor the West aims to repeat the same failures as 2014. The Ukrainian government has warned Russia that it will not stop reclaiming all its sovereign territory occupied by Russia, including Crimea. Meanwhile western countries like Germany, France, the United States and Poland have declared recognising the so-called referendum as illegal. In response, NATO and the European Union announced in tandem another package of sanctions on Russia, as did the US.

The logic behind Putin’s September 21st address indicates an interest in a ceasefire which could bring either a peaceful solution or freeze the war as a minimum option. Yet if Ukraine decides to continue its counteroffensive (all indications are it will) and the West continues to supply and rearm Kyiv, then the Kremlin will reach for its other two cards: the mobilisation of 300,000 troops, which would mean a long-lasting, bloody war, and a strategy of nuclear blackmail. The latter would be used if the Ukrainian army crosses Putin’s redline and attempts to liberate the Luhansk and Donetsk regions together with Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. After the sham referenda, Russia will recognise them as part of its own territory. Under its war doctrine Russia would defend them “by all means”, including the use of nuclear weapons.

While mobilisation is undoubtedly a convenient bargaining chip, it comes at a high social price. This is why Putin had avoided making this decision for months. Before now, the Russian forces were largely made up by paid volunteers and contract soldiers; some recruitment even took place in penal colonies. Unwilling to admit to the unpopular decision, Putin twice stressed in his address that he had decided to introduce not a full but partial mobilisation. As defence minister Sergei Shoigu explained after Putin’s speech the potential of reservists is 25 million, and “only slightly more than one per cent are subject to mobilisation”.

The authorities were right to expect protests. The Vesna organisation, which was among the first to call for them, published a proclamation on its website: “Mobilisation continues throughout the country. Soon thousands of our men may march to the front. We can and should speak out against it!” Supporters of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny have also called for protests. They argued that the choice is either to become cannon fodder at the front and return from the war as Gruz-200 (in a coffin), or rebel for which one faces only a few years in prison.

For the first time in six months Russians took to the streets in large groups when compared to more broadly individual anti-war picketing since February 24th. Frankly speaking, they are indeed against the mobilisation rather than against the war itself. Since Russia invaded Ukraine the public support for the aggression remained stable, and according to the independent Levada Center already three-quarters of Russians were backing the decision of its “special operation” against Ukraine.

On September 21st demonstrations were held in 38 Russian cities, with traditionally the largest in Moscow and St Petersburg. Protests also took place in Yekaterinburg, Perm, Voronezh, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, Ufa and others. In St Petersburg the crowd chanted “Putin to the trenches”; in Moscow “No to war!” and “Let our children live!” According to watchdog OVD-Info, more than 1,400 people had been detained by 2am on September 22nd. Some of them were handed mobilisation documents at the police station. Such cases were confirmed by OVD-Info activists, in particular in Voronezh and Moscow.

However, the protests have neither been massive nor widespread. They do not resemble those of 2018 when Putin announced an unpopular pension reform, causing the authorities to back down on some of their most controversial proposals. Nor do they look like the crowds that came out in defence of Navalny after his imprisonment last winter, not to mention massive demonstrations at the beginning of 1990. For now, they do not have the potential to create any crisis of power. Yet, it cannot be ruled out that they could escalate in the future, but most quickly as a result of Russia’s ultimate military defeat or the collapse of its economy.

The previously-introduced restrictions limiting the right to demonstrate together with effective wartime propaganda and general apathy means that Russians are either trying to avoid mobilisation by other means (emigration, corruption or looking for an exception) or are giving themselves obediently to be sent to the front.

Ultimately, the mobilisation and so-called referenda will not change the difficulties Putin continues to face. First of all, the mobilised soldiers will unlikely reach the front for several more weeks. As we know from leaks from the replenishment commands (voyenkomats), mobilisation is scheduled in three stages: by October 10th, October 25th and November 10th. The reservists’ training is scheduled for three weeks which means the earliest they will arrive in Donbas is November. Given the systemic difficulties of the Russian army, such as logistics, organisation, equipment, morale and pervasive corruption, the mobilisation may not change the situation on the front very much at all.

When adding the economic and social costs of the war, which are growing at an alarming rate, Putin may have gained some time, but he has not solved the problem. There is still a long way to go to win on the front lines and it is Ukraine that is increasingly confident that it will be able to regain the territories seized by Russia, and possibly Crimea as well. To make matters worse for Putin, Russia’s ability to restore its combat capability has been increasingly limited, while Ukraine is being equipped with more and more modern and effective weapons.

What is most important, Ukrainians are fighting for their lives and the survival of their state. Russians, on the contrary, are being forcibly conscripted into the army. And when the economic implosion occurs, the anti-mobilisation protests may turn into anti-war and even anti-government. If the situation is even more complicated and Putin loses control, then the crisis at the highest levels of government will be revived, making Putin responsible for Russia’s multi-faceted failure (military, economic and international).

At that point, a similar scenario to that in 1999 which led to a change of power comes into play. Paradoxically, it was Boris Yeltsin who appointed then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as acting president in exchange for security guarantees. Thus, Russian political scientists like Andrey Piontkovsky and Vladimir Pastukhov may be right in predicting the twilight of the Putin era. However, this does not mean a new perestroika or democratisation. It rather would be the continuation of the regime at the expense of a change only at the top. In any case, Putin’s announcement gives him some much needed time. The only question is how much is now left?

""We call on the Iranian authorities to allow peaceful protests and to not deploy further violence - in particular not fatal violence - against protesters,"" the ministry said on Twitter. ""We also communicated that directly to the Iranian ambassador in Berlin today.""

Asked about the possibility of further sanctions on Tehran in response to the violence, a ministry spokesperson had earlier said, ""we will consider all options"" with other European Union states.

Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on Iran's morality police over allegations of abuse of Iranian women.

Washington said it held the unit responsible for the Sept. 16 death of the 22-year-old Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini after she was detained by morality police enforcing the country's strict restrictions on women's dress."
1064797088,20220926,"Iran accused the United States on Monday of using unrest triggered by the death of a woman in police custody to try to destabilise the country, and warned it would not go unanswered, as the biggest protests since 2019 showed no signs of abating.

Iran has cracked down on nationwide demonstrations sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini after she was detained by morality police enforcing the Islamic Republic’s strict restrictions on women’s dress.

The case has drawn international condemnation. Iran said the United States was supporting rioters and seeking to destabilise the Islamic Republic.

“Washington is always trying to weaken Iran’s stability and security although it has been unsuccessful,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani told Nour news, which is affiliated with a top security body, in a statement.

On his Instagram page, Kanaani accused the leaders of the United States and some European countries of abusing a tragic incident in support of “rioters” and ignoring “the presence of millions of people in the streets and squares of the country in support of the system”.

Germany summoned the Iranian ambassador in Berlin on Monday over the crackdown, a German foreign ministry spokesperson said.

Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on Iran’s morality police over allegations of abuse of Iranian women, saying it held the unit responsible for the death of Amini.

Iran summoned the British and Norwegian ambassadors on Sunday over what it called interference and hostile media coverage of the unrest.

The anti-government protests are the largest to sweep the country since demonstrations over fuel prices in 2019, when Reuters reported 1,500 people were killed in a crackdown on protesters – the bloodiest bout of internal unrest in the Islamic Republic’s history.

At least 41 people have been killed in the latest unrest that started on Sept. 17, according to state TV.

President Ebrahim Raisi has said Iran ensures freedom of expression and that he has ordered an investigation into Amini’s death.

A main Iranian teachers’ union, in a statement posted on social media on Sunday, called for teachers and students to stage the first national strike since the unrest began, on Monday and Wednesday.

Women have played a prominent role in the protests, waving and burning their veils.

In a video circulating on social media, the sister of a man killed in the anti-government demonstrations, Javad Heydari, cut her hair on his grave in defiance of Iran’s conservative Islamic dress code. Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the video.

The state has organised rallies in an attempt to defuse the crisis.

Although the demonstrations over Amini’s death are a major challenge to the government, analysts see no immediate threat to the country’s leaders because Iran’s elite security forces have stamped out protests in the past.

Iran has blamed armed Iranian Kurdish dissidents of involvement in the unrest, particularly in the northwest where most of Iran’s up to 10 million Kurds live.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guards launched an artillery and drone attack on Iranian militant opposition bases in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported."
1064794630,20220919,"United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that Washington would be providing Afghanistan with $327 million in much-needed aid. The aid comes as the country’s humanitarian crisis has continued for more than one year since the Taliban took over.

Blinken issued a statement Friday last week announcing the additional $327 million in aid the US will be providing to further support humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan.

Blinken said the additional humanitarian assistance would be used to support the humanitarian response in Afghanistan as well as its neighboring countries through international organizations.

Some Western countries have raised concerns about the presence of extremist groups in Afghanistan, saying the Taliban have not upheld its counter-terrorism pledges when they retook control of the country following the West’s military withdrawal last year.

Last week, the special representatives of Afghanistan from the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the US issued a joint communique Thursday following their meeting the week prior.

The envoys said the presence of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was killed by a US drone strike back in July, was a sign that the Taliban was not upholding its commitment to the international community.

The concerns by the West also come as Afghanistan has suffered attacks claimed by extremist groups in the country. The latest attack took place Friday last week when a bomb exploded in a mosque in the capital Kabul. At least seven people were killed, and 41 were wounded in the blast, according to a Taliban official, but Afghan media outlets reported nine fatalities.

The explosion in Kabul was at the Wazir Akbar Khan, an area in the capital where the “green zone” – the location of many foreign embassies and NATO – is located. The insurgent group now controls the area.

“After prayers, when people wanted to come out from the mosque, a blast happened,” said Kabul police spokesperson Khalid Zadran. “All casualties are civilians.”

The Italian NGO-Emergency Hospital said it received 14 people from the bombing. Among the 14 people, four were pronounced dead on arrival. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan said the latest bombing was another indication that terrorist activities remain in the country."
1064795134,20220926,"That terrorist organization broke the ceasefire agreement and started the third phase of the war it provoked itself and now calls for peace to confuse all countries and the international organizations, Mahi said.

Our Government is ready for peace while the TPLF deploys its belligerent agenda in the country’s northern region, the ambassador said during a meeting with European Union representative in South Sudan Timo Olkonen.

He also considered unreliable and unethical the recent report about the war between the federal authorities and the Front, issued by the group of experts of the International Human Rights Commission.

Ethiopia does not recognize it and urged “Western nations and bodies to play a constructive role instead of looking at the conflict negatively,” according to an account of the meeting published by the Ethiopian Embassy.

The two representatives discussed the implementation of the South Sudan peace agreement, and Mahi explained Ethiopia’s contribution to achieving it definitively and thus helping stability in East Africa."

1064801308,20220926,"Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard on Monday unleashed a wave of drone strikes and artillery, targeting what Tehran says are bases of Iranian Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq, a semiofficial news agency reported.

It was the second such cross-border assault since the weekend, at a time when Iran is convulsing with protests over the death of a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman who was been detained by the nation's morality police.

On Saturday, the Guard said it targeted bases and training camps of Kurdish separatist groups in northern Iraq, claiming it inflicted serious damage.

Protests over the death of Mahsa Amini have spread across at least 46 cities, towns and villages. Iranian state TV has suggested that at least 41 protesters and police have been killed since the protests began Sept. 17. An Associated Press count of official statements by authorities tallied at least 13 dead, with more than 1,200 demonstrators arrested.

In Monday's report, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency said the Guard's attacks were in response for the support that the separatists have allegedly provided for the unrest inside Iran, as well as their attempts to smuggle in weapons.

Last year, the Guard similarly attacked what it called bases of ""terrorist groups"" in northern Iraq.

There was no immediate comment from the Iraqi government. The two neighboring countries have close political and military ties, and Tehran had provided extensive military support for Baghdad, during its yearslong war against the extremist Islamic State group.

The German foreign ministry said Monday it has summoned Iran's ambassador following the protests in Iran and especially regarding the brutal actions of police there.

A spokesman for German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Berlin that there were consultations within the European Union as well on how to respond to the regime's brutal reaction to the protests."

1064802848,20220919,
1064805549,20220926,"When we talk about #NoMore, we need to separate its intellectual leaders who frame the ideological undergirds of the movement’s narrative structure, and its social media connoisseurs who choreograph the chorus of its protest voices and the art of its street defiant dances. The movement’s problem resides in its intellectual genesis and theology that see the West as Ethiopia’s adversary, if not an outright enemy. This has prohibited the movement from developing diplomatic strategy and skills to influence geopolitical developments and capitalize on global opportunities. Time has proven that the movement’s underlying narrative is misguided. The movement needs to rebrand itself with a robust narrative and sound guiding principles.

One example suffices to make the case for transformation. Before the TPLF triggered the third war on August 24, the IMF and the Paris Club were finalizing a debt relief and restructuring program for Ethiopia. Ethiopia is one of the only three African countries that is under consideration for such a generous initiative. In addition, the IMF was ready to disburse a new and unprecedented multibillion dollar loan. After the war, some countries, including the US put the break on the IMF and Paris Club initiative to use it as a leverage of influence to get Ethiopia agree to a ceasefire.

The #NoMore movement has two options: To continue its protest, accusing the US as an enemy or adopting a strategic campaign to influence its decisions. In choosing its options, it needs to look at historical data. During the TPLF era, Ethiopia received $2.2 billion annual average in development assistance and official aid. For the years 2018 to 2020 (since PM Abiy took office) the annual average was $5.0 billion per year, significantly more than twice the figure during TPLF’s era.

Net Official Development Assistance data is not available for 2021. However, in 2021 Ethiopia is the number one aid recipient from the US ($1.13 billion) followed by Jordan ($1.03 billion) and Afghanistan ($860 million). The #NoMore narrative that the West has harmful intentions toward Ethiopia is divorced from reality.

This proposal offers an alternative narrative that can help the #NoMore movement to transform itself from an impassioned and reflexive protest platform to a reflective and adoptive influence maker. The movement has a powerful platform and capable social media connoisseurs. What it needs is to repurpose its to advance Ethiopia’s geopolitical and diplomatic interests. Put differently, it needs to free itself from አቱቶ ቡቱቶ peddling intellectuals whose paranoic hysteria leads them to see foreign powers as Ethiopia’s natural enemies. Only then the movement can play a pivotal role to pave the path for peace in Ethiopia and leverage Ethiopia’s geopolitical engagement as a resource base for its development.

The proposal is based on my forthcoming article that will appear in . It argues “A lasting peace can come only if the international community takes deliberate actions to alter the TPLF’s political calculus.” The article makes the case that the international community must recognize that its bothsidesism has created false equivalency and encouraged the TPLF to stay the course of destruction. The international community does not have leverage against the TPLF, but it has the threat of sanction against the government of Ethiopia. The TPLF is capitalizing on this asymmetry of international peace enforcement mechanisms. In a sort of a subversive way, by delaying the IMF’s debt restructuring process and withholding critically needed international loans to Ethiopia, organizations like the IMF are doing the TPLF’s bidding.

Ethiopians need to go beyond protest rallies and articulate Ethiopia’s narrative. The thinking that the world knows the truth and therefore there is no need to spend time and energy reiterating its story is otherworldly and detached from global practice in the 21st century. spend billions annually in advertisement to protect their brands and control their narratives – Coca Cola ($4 billion), Toyota ($3.6 billion) and Apple ($1.7 billion). Nations do the same. They hire lobbyists, international PR houses and media influencers to narrate and propagate their profiles and national interests. On this front the Ethiopian government lost to the TPLF by forfeiture. The #NoMore movement was born out of this vacuum to lash out against the international community.

The Misguided Ideology that Pushed the #NoMore Movement into a Rabbit Hole

Allow me to summon Professor Al Mariam as an alibi. : “The U.S. and E.U. want a weak, famine-stricken, ethnically fragmented vassal state in Ethiopia. That is why they are desperate to restore the TPLF regime.” : “What is happening in the relationship between Ethiopia and the U.S. is a clash of civilizations. It is a clash between a civilization founded on white European supremacy and an African civilization deeply rooted in black independence.” In May 2022, he added : “US Senator Jim Risch is doggedly committed to destroying Ethiopia because he wants to avenge the humiliating and devastating double loss of a white army in Africa in recorded history.”

Professor Al is not an exception. He is a reflection of the general sentiment. accused the US of trying “to reinstate TPLF in Ethiopia at the expense of the life of tens of thousands of Ethiopians.” Ambassador Mohamed Hassan held Biden responsible for “instigating the TPLF to start [the] war in November 2020.” Others see the US’s intervention as an attempt to keep the TPLF strong enough to use it as a check against PM Abiy.

Young leaders of the #NoMore movement relied on such groundless and irresponsible narratives to build a powerful social media platform to fight back. #NoMore became a protest movement when it could be a force of influence. The young activists lost themselves in a hall of mirrors, becoming a reflection of አቱቶ ቡቶቶ intellectuals who are themselves a reflection of hermitized souls from centuries past – a reflection of a reflection of reflection.

The TPLF Sees the West’s Interest as “Saving Aby”

What does the TPLF want and where does the West stand? Let us hear what the military and political leaders of TPLF and pro TPLF Tigrayan and foreign intellectuals say.

: “The Tigray Central Command pursued the war in order to compel the government to negotiate on equal terms and, failing that, to replace it with an all-inclusive Transitional Government. Washington DC openly opposed the advance of the Tigray Defense Force (TDF) to Addis Ababa, threatening the government of Tigray with sanctions if our forces approached the city… Tigrayan people do not even receive humanitarian aid… They appealed for a cessation of hostilities and for humanitarian access, but in practice these were empty gestures.”

: “Most ‘peace initiatives’ are mainly about saving Abiy, not about addressing the most critical political challenges in the country. Efforts that fail to address our conditions & the tendency to conflate humanitarian issues with political ones are doomed to fail!”

“There is something worse than #Ethiopia’s Abiy regime. It is the people at @StateDept, @AsstSecStateAF, @WHNSC, @UN, @_AfricanUnion, @WorldBank, & elsewhere who enable his reign of terror. #Tigray isn’t the only casualty either. The entire country is on fire. May God judge you.”

: “The European Union was right to criticize @WorldBank funding to #Ethiopia. Sadly, the United States did nothing to block the vote at the Bank’s board meeting, a decision that was advocated by Germany, Italy, and France. #Tigray”

: “Despite 13 Security Council meetings, 4 Special Envoys, over 500,000 deaths, 5.4 million IDPs and refugees, International Community failed to end the siege, ensure full access, and prevent relapse to war. It is criminal for Council members to continue to arm the regime in Addis.”

: “In Ethiopia, international peace diplomacy now driven exclusively by realpolitik. No one gives a fuck about 2 years of world’s deadliest conflict, mass rape, mass starvation, genocidal siege. That is the depressing reality.”

What is the Source of TPLF’s and Its Advocates’ Frustration?

For starters, let us divide the timeframe since the war started into five blocks: (1) November 2020 to January 2021 when Ethiopian and Eritreans forces were obliterating TPLF forces; (2) January 2021 to November 2021 when TPLF gained momentum, forced the Ethiopian and Eritrean forces to leave Tigray, and marched toward Addis reaching Debre Sina; (3) November 2021 to March 2022, when ENDF inflicted heavy damage to TPLF forces and compelled them to retreat to Tigray; (4) March 2022 to August 2022 when both parties agreed to a ceasefire; and (5) August 2022 to present days when the TPLF got defeated in the war it triggered and proposed a unilateral ceasefire but the Ethiopian government ignored it and continued pushing deep into Tigray territories.

TPLF is frustrated because the West is relatively quiet when TPLF is losing the war as was (and still is) the case in the first and fifth blocks of time noted above. In both cases the TPLF appealed to international military interventions and no fly zone to no avail. On September 15, 2022, René Lefort, a lifelong TPLF advocate , tweeting: “Finally, the first international reaction to the bombings in Mekele, but very soft. The EU “regrets” the bombing (and not “denounce” or “condemn” for example) and “encourages” (and not “urges” for example) the two parties to negotiate.”

On the other hand, the US’s pressure on Ethiopia to engage in a negotiated settlement was the loudest during the time when TPLF was advancing toward Addis, not when Ethiopia is winning. This can easily be verified by comparing the number of press releases, tweets, and sanction threats during the five blocks of time. For example, the US Senate S.3199 – Ethiopia Peace and Stabilization Act of 2022 was introduced on November 4, 2021. The bill was shelved after TPLF’s advance was thwarted. Though there is the AGOA sanction laid on Ethiopia in January 2021, it was no more than symbolic. Ethiopia continues to get billions in aid and new loans.

As The TPLF marched toward Addis, the US went as far as threatening to send American troops to Ethiopia to stop the TPLF from entering the capital under the guise of forming a provisional government consisting of various tribal opposition forces. We have not heard the US threatening to send troops after the TPLF lost the momentum and retreated to its regional enclave. The US was unequivocally and publicly opposed to TPLF’s advance and TPLF’s attempt to form a provisional government with OLF-Shene and others. Here are some examples.

– “Prosperity Party has significant support across Ethiopia as reflected in the election results… The PM indeed has a mandate he can draw upon, and a new cabinet composed of hand-picked, trusted allies and partners.”

General William Zana, Commander of Joint Task Force for the HOA, November 12, 2021 : “What happens within Ethiopia is inexplicably tied to the security and the safety of the rest of the region. The crisis can change the regional political calculus with respect to GERD. There is a risk that other countries may look at Ethiopia’s internal focus as an opportunity to take whether a military action or strong political action… The US forces are ready to respond.”

: “I denounce the threat to ‘oust Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed – through political negotiation or military force if necessary – and install a transitional government’ made by the alliance of the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front with the Oromo Liberation Army and other opposition groups throughout Ethiopia.”

– “it is very important that the differences, the conflicts be resolved by people sitting down at the table, talking, discussing, negotiating. And that needs to be done, in my judgment, pursuant to the constitutional order, including with the duly elected leaders of the country – Prime Minister Abiy.”

“In #Ethiopia, the best that the #TPLF can expect from an African Union peace process will be the dissolution of the movement and amnesty for the leadership. The cost of rebuilding the Tigray state will be formidable.”

How Can Both Ethiopia and TPLF Fail to Understand US’s Strategic Interests?

The TPLF thought the public relations victories it gained through lobbyists and hired international media were strategic victories against Ethiopia. Its leaders believed international condemnations against Ethiopia and press releases and bills introduced by US lawmakers signified an opportunity to overthrow the Abiy administration and establish the EPRDF 2.0. The US’s threat to sanction TPLF and send American troops threw a wet blanket on their hopes and enthusiasms.

On the Ethiopia side, the apprehension and confusion come from a disconnect between the US’s strategic interests and policy actions during the Biden administration. In my 14-page article titled “ I started with factors that DO NOT explain the US intervention. These are: Thwarting China’s influence in Ethiopia; doing Egypt’s bidding in the Nile conflict; destabilizing Ethiopia, fearing its potential in becoming a black power; and planting TPLF back to power as an agent government to exploit Ethiopia’s resources. None of these explain the Biden administration’s interventions.

Those who are not well versed in geopolitics and lack a clear understanding of American policy making processes may wonder what explains the Baden’s seemingly pro TPLF policy in 2020 and 2021. The issue is two layered. To understand Biden’s seemingly counterintuitive policy we need to tease out and separate strategic and tactical factors. For an in-depth explanation, see my article titled “ .”

What Needs to be Done?

The first task is to develop a narrative upon which the #NoMore movement can rebuild its campaign to become a platform of influence. I hope my forthcoming article in can serve as a starting point. If not, I hope the movement develops its own narrative. Once the movement reinvents itself, its first campaign should be exerting pressure on the IMF to approve the debt restructuring and relief. May God help the brilliant young activists to free themselves from hermitized intellectuals who have deafened themselves with the cacophony their own አቱቶ ቡቶቶ."

A proposed natural gas pipeline running from Tanzania to Uganda may have a positive environmental impact in a region where the majority of households still cook using charcoal or wood, according to Patrick Mweheire, Standard Bank Group’s regional chief executive officer for East Africa.

“One of the biggest issues in Uganda is that you know, 70% of cooking is still done by charcoal and firewood, so they’re cutting trees down,” Mweheire said in an interview Friday.

The line, if built, would run parallel to the $4 billion East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) currently under construction. The EACOP, being developed by a group including TotalEnergies SE, will transport crude from Uganda’s oil fields to Tanzania’s coastline.

The oil pipeline is opposed by environmentalists and the gas line may face similar resistance. But Mweheire said the projects would have “huge benefits” for both nations. The gas pipeline, in particular, would help curb deforestation, he said.

Uganda intends to proceed with the EACOP, which will transport oil 900 miles from the shores of Lake Albert on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Tanzania’s Tanga port on the Indian Ocean.

The European Union has urged the governments to stop work on the pipeline on the grounds that it threatens fragile wildlife habitats.

Mweheire said the EACOP will require $15 billion of investment in the region over the next three to five years to build new road infrastructure and an airport in western Uganda, which is already 80% complete.

Standard Bank believes Uganda’s GDP is going to start growing by double digits in the next three years, and “will effectively double also in five years from roughly $30 billion today to $60 billion by 2028,” he said."

1064811924,20220926,"African leaders and governments in Europe, Asia and the Americas on Tuesday vowed to act ""with urgency, at scale and in concert"" in responding to the current food insecurity and nutrition crisis unfolding around the world.

The leaders, representing the African Union, European Union, United States, Spain, Colombia, Germany, Indonesia, and Nigeria, issued a joint declaration at the Global Food Security Summit to affirm their commitment. Leaders also noted that overcoming global food insecurity would require innovative partnerships drawing in a wide range of key stakeholders in the global community.

The event took place on 20 September on the sidelines of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.

Senegal's President Macky Sall, chair of the African Union, said around 800 million people were currently experiencing hunger, an increase of 150 million since the onset of Covid-19, according to a recent FAO report.

""When a crisis of this magnitude hits the world, every single country suffers,"" President Sall said. He added that the situation worsened due to the war in Ukraine, which has triggered a sharp rise in food and fertilizers prices.

He cautioned against imposing trade restrictions. ""What is urgent today is to work together to ensure openness and transparency of markets for grains and fertilizer so that all countries can have access to them in accordance with international trade rules.""

Sall commended the African Development Bank for swiftly launching its $1.5 billion African Emergency Food Production Facility to avert a looming food crisis. The Bank's facility will facilitate the production of 38 million tonnes of food, representing a $12 billion increase in output in just two years.

As of July 2022, the Bank's Board had approved a cumulative $1.13 billion in mixed financing to 24 African countries under the Facility.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called on governments, the private sector, the research community and civil society to join the Global Alliance for Food Security, an initiative launched by the world's most developed economies (G7) and the World Bank in May.

Sholz, current chair of the G7, cautioned that climate change was likely to sharpen food insecurity, demanding a response. ""It is essential that at COP27 in Egypt in two months, all countries must have the political commitment and momentum for ambitious climate action... we need to see action now,"" he said.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called on wealthy countries to provide more emergency food assistance for those who needed it.

He stressed: ""We have to strengthen global food systems and help countries develop the capacity to produce their own food so that we can prevent new crises and build resilience to further shocks... We need durable agricultural production. We have to respond to the emergency, but we also have to set ourselves up for the long term.""

In their joint declaration, the leaders highlighted seven actions set out in the Roadmap for Global Food Security, A Call to Action, which emerged from the Food Systems Summit held in 2021. These include:

Keep food, fertilizer, and agricultural markets open and avoid unjustified restrictive measures, such as export bans on food and fertilizer, which increase market volatility and threaten food security and nutrition globally.

Accelerate support for sustainable agriculture and food systems by bolstering productivity, particularly in the most affected countries, to build their resilience and boost domestic production, including supporting an energy transition that is just and equitable to make them more resilient and available to producers of all scale, including smallholder farmers.

Increase investments in research and technology to develop and implement science-based, climate-resilient agricultural innovations, including seeds, that contribute to building sustainable and resilient agricultural and food systems.

1064820065,20220926,"Protests have erupted in Russia’s predominately Muslim region of Dagestan against Vladimir Putin’s conscription order, as some claim that the region is being disproportionally targeted to fight in the war against Ukraine.

Videos on social media appear to show men gathering in a public square and jostling with police, women protesting the conscription of their children for a war Russia started, and a police officer running away from women.

The protests come after Putin called for the mobilization of 300,000 “reservists” to join the war on Ukraine. Russia has claimed the only men to be mobilized will be those with military experience, but reports have surfaced indicating that ethnic minorities and men across Russia with no previous military experience have also been ordered to conscript.

A video on social media appears to show a Russian man fatally shoot a commander after being told to mobilize.

Tens of thousands of men have fled Russia since the mobilization order last week, according to the Moscow Times. The men have mostly fled to Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, where visas are not required, and there were over 3,000 cars on the Russia-Georgia border on Monday, the outlet reported.

Four out of the five European Union countries bordering Russian have banned Russians from crossing the border, even if they have tourist visas. Finland is the only country allowing Russians to cross.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday that there is “nothing to preview” when asked if the U.S. will grant political asylum to Russians fleeing the county.

1064814196,20220926,"It seems that in the 2022/23 season, Uzbekistan can get a good benefit from the export of garlic to EU countries. The fact is that garlic prices in the European Union are increasing due to delays in exports and an increase in the cost of logistics for the delivery of garlic from China. Therefore, importers became interested in the possibility of partial replacement of Chinese garlic in the EU market with garlic from Uzbekistan.

Uzbekistan annually exports about 3,000 tons of garlic, mainly to Russia and Kazakhstan. The record volume of exports was noted in 2018, when more than 5,000 tons of this fresh product were exported. In 2022, from the very beginning of the early garlic harvesting season, its exports remained quite high.

Uzbekistan already has some experience in exporting fresh garlic to the European Union and even supplied garlic to the United States. The export of Uzbek garlic to the EU countries and the US happened mainly in 2019. Among the EU countries that purchased garlic from Uzbekistan were Latvia, Poland and the Czech Republic. Also, annually, small volumes of Uzbek garlic are supplied to the UAE."

1064818057,20220926,"Some of the West’s fiercest critics made their cases in the closing hours of the U.N. General Assembly meeting of world leaders, as Syria and North Korea on Monday accused the United States and its allies of trying to impose their will on the world.

Syria’s top diplomat called for a U.S.-led military coalition to get out of his country, a North Korean ambassador said his nation wouldn’t yield to U.N. demands to give up its nuclear weapons program, and both condemned sanctions against their countries.

If the messages weren’t exactly new, they carried the extra weight of a once-a-year chance to speak from the same famous podium as the leaders of other nations, including their adversaries. U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the assembly last week, making no direct mention of Syria but briefly complaining that North Korea “continues to blatantly violate U.N. sanctions” over its nuclear activities.

North Korean U.N. Ambassador Kim Song retorted Monday that Biden “picked on us,” and Kim shrugged off his message.

“To put it clearly, we have never recognized such resolutions of the United Nations that impose pressure” because North Korea views them as U.S. aims given an international imprimatur, Kim said.

“We will not recognize them in the future, either,” he added.

He said relations were potentially “heading into a much more dangerous phase” — potentially the shakiest since World War II — because of the “high-handedness and arbitrariness of some countries” that he said were trying to overwrite the international system with “Western values.”

Syria Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad also took aim at sanctions, which the the U.S., some other countries and the European Union have imposed on his country’s government, oil industry and more. He said his country has been “economically besieged” by powers bent on getting their way and retaining their wealth.

“The war against Syria, ultimately, was an attempt by the West to maintain control over the world,” he said.

The civil war began in 2011 with anti-government protests demanding that President Bashar Assad’s government make democratic reforms, but the situation quickly escalated into fighting that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Amid the chaos, the Islamic State militant group took over significant parts of Syria. In 2019, the group lost the last sliver of land its fighters controlled, but its sleeper cells are still active.

To Syria’s frustration, hundreds of U.S. troops are stationed in the country’s east to help the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to fight the militants. Mekdad said the coalition’s presence contradicts international law and “should end immediately, without conditions.”

“Fighting terrorism does not happen through an illegitimate international coalition that violates Syria’s sovereignty and destroys towns and villages,” he said, arguing that battling terrorism can’t work without “coordination” with Assad’s government.

Syria also wants compensation for $107 billion in “direct and indirect” losses in its oil and gas sector during the war, Mekdad said. The American forces and the SDF currently control much of the oil fields in eastern Syria.

The U.S. didn’t immediately respond to the remarks from Mekdad and Kim. They spoke on the closing day of the annual “debate” that brings presidents, monarchs, premiers and cabinet ministers to the assembly’s podium.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has taken up much of the discussion this year, but the six days of speeches still formed a mosaic of global issues, national priorities, regional rivalries and don’t-forgets. Monday was no exception.

Mauritanian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salem Ould Merzoug called for debt cancellation for African countries. His Canadian counterpart, Mélanie Joly, told the world’s women that her country would “speak up for your rights and dignity — no government, no politician, no judge, no one, can take that away from you.”

Bhutan’s foreign minister, Tandi Dorji, said he overhauled his speech after getting a letter from a 7-year-old girl in his Himalayan homeland. She worried that her small community would be flooded by melting snow and glaciers in a warming world, he said, reading from the letter.

“I would request your excellency to kindly convey this small message to the world leaders and big and rich nations to help and save our tiny village from global warming,” she wrote. “I am sure if we all come together, we can not only save our tiny village but also make our Earth safe for all living beings.”

The high-profile speeches began last week with countries that sent heads of state and government. By Monday, foreign minister- and ambassador-level speakers were taking the podium, and the colossal security cordon around the United Nations headquarters had been largely dismantled.

On the final day, many speakers still spoke emphatically about how important the global organization remains in a fragmented world.

“We need more of the U.N., not less,” Joly said.

As the last country to weigh in, Nauru took stock of a world that has been buffeted by the Ukraine war, the coronavirus pandemic and climate change, all at once. But diplomat Josie-Ann Dongobir closed with hope “that this year allows us to be open to the transformation we seek.”

1064825942,20220926,"ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey on Monday summoned the Greek ambassador to protest the alleged deployment of dozens of U.S.-made armored vehicles to Greek islands which Ankara says should remain demilitarized in line with international treaties.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned, meanwhile, that Turkey wouldn't hold back on defending its rights and interests against Greece.

Turkish media on Sunday published aerial images that they said showed the deployment of armored vehicles by Greece to the Aegean islands of Samos and Lesbos, heightening tensions between the two NATO countries that have a history of rivalry. Turkish officials say the deployment is in violation of the islands' nonmilitary status according to international law.

Turkish officials summoned Greek Ambassador Christodoulos Lazaris to the Turkish Foreign Ministry on Monday, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. It said Turkey also filed a protest with Washington, but didn't provide details.

Erdogan accused Greece of engaging in acts of provocation against Turkey.

“We will not fail to defend our country’s rights and interests against Greece by using all the means at our disposal, when necessary,” Erdogan said following a Cabinet meeting.

Turkey and Greece have decades-old disputes over an array of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean Sea and disputes over the airspace there. The disputes have brought them to the brink of war three times in the last half-century.

Tensions flared in 2020 over exploratory drilling rights in areas of the Mediterranean Sea — where Greece and Cyprus claim exclusive economic zones — leading to a naval standoff.

More recently, Turkey has accused Greece of violating international agreements by militarizing islands in the Aegean Sea. It has also accused Greek surface-to-air missiles of locking on to Turkish F-16 fighter jets carrying out a reconnaissance mission in international airspace — an accusation Greece has rejected.

Athens says it needs to defend the islands — many of which lie close to Turkey’s coast — against a potential attack from Turkey.

A Greek government official told The Associated Press that Greece “fully respects” its international obligations, adding that the Greek ambassador told his interlocuters that “Greece is not the country that is threatening its neighbor with war or assembling a large landing force on its coastline as Turkey has done.”

The official added that Turkey “continues to violate Greece’s sovereignty with its continuous violations of its airspace and overflights of Greek territory.” The official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly to the news media, made the remarks on condition of anonymity.

Turkish media reports quoted security officials as saying 23 of the armored vehicles were sent to Lesbos and 18 others were sent to Samos.

Meanwhile, Greek authorities said a six-year-old migration agreement between Turkey and the European Union remains in effect despite an escalating dispute between the two neighbors over the treatment of refugees.

Notis Mitarachi, the migration affairs minister, said Greece will continue to observe the 2016 deal that allows it to send back most migrants travelling illegally from nearby Turkey.

“It is clear that for those coming from Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, that Turkey is a safe country,” Mitarachi said. “Unfortunately, smugglers are still ‘selling tickets’ to people from those countries.”

Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Erdogan last week accused Greece of committing “crimes against humanity” by carrying out potentially deadly expulsions of migrants travelling from the Turkish mainland to nearby Greek islands.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis described the claims as “absurd,” charging Turkey with “weaponizing” migration to apply political pressure on Greece and other European countries."

Liz Truss has been urged to attend a meeting of European leaders by Brussels’ representative in the UK.

European Union ambassador Joao Vale de Almeida suggested the Prime Minister should attend the European Political Community (EPC) meeting in Prague in October.

He also said Ms Truss’ new administration offered an opportunity to resolve difficulties between Brussels and Westminster as he warned levels of mutual trust had dropped “too low” in recent years.

The European Political Community is Emmanuel Macron’s scheme to bring together EU nations and countries outside the bloc, potentially including the UK.

No 10 is thought to be considering whether Ms Truss or another minister will attend the gathering.

At a fringe meeting at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, the ambassador said levels of mutual trust between the UK and EU were “too low to be able to produce good results” .

Calling for more regular summits, he said: “Where is the dialogue between our leaders?

“It’s not happening and when it happens it’s not necessarily on a good basis.”

Mr Vale de Almeida said he would “fully support” the presence of Ms Truss at the EPC meeting: “This will be, if it happens, a very good signal in a direction of starting a new cycle, having a mature relationship on issues of fundamental common interest.”

The EU views the Government’s attempts to tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol as illegal and Mr Vale de Almeida said the UK and Brussels needed to remove the stumbling blocks that prevented progress in the relationship.

He said it had been difficult to come to a “sound platform of understanding”.

The message to Ms Truss was to “seize the opportunity that the beginning of a new cycle should provide to reassess where we are and to fundamentally opt for a constructive path forward in trying to find solutions for the problems that have been identified in the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol”.

At the event, hosted by the Centre for European Reform, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said “of course” Ms Truss should attend the EPC meeting in Prague because “these are our allies, our partners”.

He said the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which will override parts of the deal signed with the EU on post-Brexit arrangements, was a “kamikaze approach to diplomacy” and warned that if it passed it would risk “a trade war with our closest allies”.

Mr Lammy also defended Labour’s approach to Brexit policy: “I think it’s completely legitimate for us in the Opposition to set out our ambition to solve problems that are emerging but to rule out joining the single market and customs union at this stage “"

1064824787,20220926,"Two years after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbas region, Ukraine remains a nation in peril. Russia considers its annexation of Crimea a fait accompli, has taken steps to consolidate its position in the Black Sea, and has created a frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Despite an official cease-fire, war is a day-to-day reality in the Donbas region, and Crimea remains under Russian occupation. Ukraine’s economic reforms remain incomplete; corruption continues to be a virulent and hardy foe. The U.S. needs to stay engaged in Ukraine. This means implementing policies that help the Ukrainians to defend themselves from Russian aggression, promoting economic and political reform, and keeping international pressure on Moscow to fully implement the latest cease-fire agreement, concluded more than a year ago.

When Kremlin-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych failed to sign an association agreement with the European Union in 2013, months of street demonstrations led to his ouster in early 2014. Russia responded by violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sending troops, aided by pro-Russian local militia, to occupy the Crimean peninsula under the pretext of “protecting Russian people.” This led to Russia’s eventual annexation of Crimea. Such annexation by force is unprecedented in the 21st century.

Backed, armed, and trained by Russia, separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine declared the so-called Lugansk People’s Republic and the Donetsk People’s Republic. Since then, Russia has continued to back separatist factions in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine with advanced weapons, technical and financial assistance, and Russian conventional and special operations forces.

Two cease-fire agreements—one in September 2014 and another in February 2015, known as Minsk I and Minsk II—have come and gone. Since the most recent agreement went into effect, hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and hundreds more have been wounded. EUCOM Commander General Philip Breedlove calls Minsk II “a cease-fire in name only.”[1]

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference two months ago, Lamberto Zannier, Secretary-General of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is charged with overseeing the cease-fire, warned that the situation is the worst it has been since September 2015. In particular, he cited systematic cease-fire violations and poor access for OSCE monitors to areas held by Russian-backed separatists, with no access to the border between Ukraine and Russia where weapons and materiel enter the country.[2]

Russia’s ultimate goal is to keep Ukraine out of the transatlantic community. Russia will also want to consolidate the gains made by separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Politically, Russia will do everything it can, especially through proxies and propaganda, to discredit the democratically elected government in Kyiv.

Russia’s primary short-term goal in Ukraine will be to keep the conflict in eastern Ukraine frozen—meaning that even if bullets stop flying, there will be no real effort on Russia’s part to bring a conclusive end to the conflict. This equates to victory for Moscow and defeat for Kyiv, because it leaves Ukraine unable to control all of its territory. Russia can also use the frozen status of the separatist-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk regions as bargaining leverage in future talks with the West on other issues, such as accepting Russia’s annexation of Crimea or applying pressure on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to step down.

Russia’s destabilization efforts are not relegated to the Donbas region. Russian hackers are widely suspected of being behind a series of cyberattacks in December 2015 that took down power stations in Kyiv and in regions of western Ukraine. The malware used in the attack has its origins in Russia and was so destructive that it knocked out call centers where Ukrainians could report outages, as well as internal systems that power companies use to get power networks back online. The attack is believed to be the first cyberattack to target a power grid.

Corruption remains a serious problem. In February 2016, Ukraine’s economic development and trade minister resigned over frustration with how deeply rooted corruption ran in the economy, saying that “systemic reform is decisively blocked.” The resignation triggered a new period of political instability.

Ukraine’s Prime Minister Yatsenyuk survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote in February only when MPs from an opposition party linked to oligarchs left the chamber before the vote, leading some to speculate that an underhanded deal had been struck. Following the vote, two parties withdrew support from the governing coalition, leading to its de facto fall.

In April, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who is seeking to form a new ruling coalition and replace Yatsenyuk with an ally from his own party, was listed in the so-called Panama Papers, accused of using an offshore company as a tax haven for his confectionary business. While wrongdoing may or may not be proven, the episode complicates already tortuous coalition bargaining and makes snap parliamentary elections more likely.

Ukraine is ranked 162nd out of 178 countries in the 2016 Index of Economic Freedom[3] and has the lowest level of economic freedom in Europe. Its economy shrank by 10 percent in 2015, in part due to the continuing war in the East. Concerns that the government has not moved quickly and firmly enough to put in place economic reforms have led the International Monetary Fund to delay—since October—the next $1.7 billion disbursement of $17.5 billion in loans earmarked for Ukraine. Further complicating its financial situation, Ukraine is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Russia over restructuring and repayment of a $3 billion loan dating from 2013.

While the conflict in Ukraine has faded from the headlines somewhat, Ukraine still needs U.S. support as it faces significant economic and security challenges. In addition to publicly condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, the U.S. should:
• Resist Russian attempts to link Ukraine to its role in Syria. Russian policymakers are likely to try to parlay an increasingly important role in Syria into a reduction in sanctions and legitimation of its control of Crimea. The U.S. should resist these efforts, making it clear to Russia that U.S. policy toward Russia vis-à-vis Ukraine will be judged by Russian actions there, not held hostage to promises of helpful behavior elsewhere.
• Make the case for continued sanctions. Russia continues to violate the terms of the Minsk II agreement, fanning a frozen conflict that continues to engulf Ukraine. The U.S. should strongly encourage allies in Europe to renew sanctions against Russia in July should these conditions remain unmet.
• Promote economic and political reform in Ukraine. The U.S. and Europe should cooperate to enhance governance in Ukraine. Tackling corruption and building a vibrant, free economy to attract investors will go a long way toward securing Ukraine’s future.
• Supply defensive weaponry to Ukraine. Every country has the inherent right to self-defense. Defensive weapons can be an effective part of a larger strategy for assisting Ukraine. As authorized by the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, the U.S. should increase its assistance to the Ukrainian military to include anti-armor, anti-aircraft, and small-arms weapons of a defensive nature. Any planned joint training exercises between the U.S., NATO, and Ukraine should continue, and more such exercises should be scheduled.

Russia’s goals in Ukraine are both geopolitical and imperial. Without Ukraine, or at least without considerable influence in Ukraine, Russia sees itself only as an Asian power, not as a European power. Now is not the time for the United States to abandon the people of Ukraine. Rather, the U.S. should continue to increase assistance to the Ukrainian military, champion economic reforms, and support the reformers in Ukraine who are fighting corruption.

1064828371,20220926,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey on Monday summoned the Greek ambassador to protest the alleged deployment of dozens of U.S.-made armored vehicles to Greek islands which Ankara says should remain demilitarized in line with international treaties.

Turkish media on Sunday published aerial images that they said showed the deployment of armored vehicles by Greece to the Aegean islands of Samos and Lesbos, heightening tensions between the two NATO countries that have a history of rivalry. Turkish officials say the deployment is in violation of the islands' nonmilitary status according to international law.

“We will not fail to defend our country’s rights and interests against Greece by using all the means at our disposal, when necessary,” Erdogan said following a Cabinet meeting.

Turkey and Greece have decades-old disputes over an array of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean Sea and disputes over the airspace there. The disputes have brought them to the brink of war three times in the last half-century.

More recently, Turkey has accused Greece of violating international agreements by militarizing islands in the Aegean Sea. It has also accused Greek surface-to-air missiles of locking on to Turkish F-16 fighter jets carrying out a reconnaissance mission in international airspace — an accusation Greece has rejected.

A Greek government official told The Associated Press that Greece “fully respects” its international obligations, adding that the Greek ambassador told his interlocuters that “Greece is not the country that is threatening its neighbor with war or assembling a large landing force on its coastline as Turkey has done.”

The official added that Turkey “continues to violate Greece’s sovereignty with its continuous violations of its airspace and overflights of Greek territory.” The official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly to the news media, made the remarks on condition of anonymity.

Turkish media reports quoted security officials as saying 23 of the armored vehicles were sent to Lesbos and 18 others were sent to Samos.

Meanwhile, Greek authorities said a six-year-old migration agreement between Turkey and the European Union remains in effect despite an escalating dispute between the two neighbors over the treatment of refugees.

“It is clear that for those coming from Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, that Turkey is a safe country,” Mitarachi said. “Unfortunately, smugglers are still ‘selling tickets’ to people from those countries.”"
1064833007,20220926,"Agro- pastoral infrastructure facilities aimed at boosting livestock mobility and production, increasing economic activities and revenue mobilisation have been commissioned at Bawku and Pusiga Districts of the Upper East Region.

The infrastructure consists of a 95-kilometre transhumance movement corridor from Sapelliga to Zongoiri, loading ramps at Zebilla and Pusiga, water points at Agaago and Yarigu communities and a transhumance camp site at Zongoiri.

It aims to support livestock mobility for better access to resources and Markets in West Africa and increase the Internally Generated Funds drive of the assemblies.

The Ghana Developing Communities Association (GDCA), a non-governmental organization based in the Northern Region, in collaboration with the various District and Municipal Assemblies built and commissioned the facilities with funding from the European Union (EU), the Acting for Life (AFL) and the French Agency for Development (AFD).

At a ceremony in Zebilla to hand over the facilities to the Assemblies, Alhaji Osman Abdel-Rahman, the Executive Director of GDCA, said the project had been working to achieve social cohesion, inclusion, and economic benefits.

“Over the past four years, the Project to Support the Mobility of Livestock for Better Access to Resources and Markets in West Africa (PAMOBARMA) under the GDCA, has brought about great achievements, enhanced social cohesion and economic benefits, and contributed to the increasing level of agro pastoral infrastructure.

“We owe all that the project has delivered to the European Union (EU), the French Agency for Development (AFD), and Acting for Life (AFL), who together provided funding to the tune of EUR 809,000 to make it happen,” he added.

Alhaji Abdel-Rahman expressed gratitude to the chiefs and people of the respective communities for their cooperation throughout the execution of the project and urged them to make judicious use of it.

Alhaji Ahmed Issahaku Tahiru, the District Chief Executive of Bawku West, thanked GDCA and its partners for their support over the years, to boost economic activities and improve the livestock industry and urged livestock farmers to make the facilities their own and help the Assembly realize its benefits.

He said the facilities were structured in a way that would help the project management committee and assembly members monitor the entry and exit of herders.

Naba Emmanuel Ayagiba III, Chief of Sapelliga, commended the GDCA for ensuring social cohesion and inclusion while lauding the professionalism it exhibited during the community entry process.

“The community entry process by GDCA was excellent and that is commendable, they showed a high level of professionalism and must be applauded for recognizing traditional authority which has ensured the smooth running of the project for our benefit,” he said."

NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus is seeking help from the United Nations to stem an “avalanche” of migrants who make their way from the ethnically divided island’s breakaway north across a U.N.-controlled buffer zone to seek asylum in numbers that authorities cannot cope with, the interior minister said Monday.

Minister Nikos Nouris said 94% of the 15,130 asylum-seekers who filed applications with the divided island’s internationally recognized government in the south through August this year had traversed the buffer zone. That is double the number from the same period last year.

Nouris will travel to New York this week for meetings with the U.N. Secretary-General’s Cabinet Chief Courtenay Rattray and U.N. Under Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix to brief them in detail about the situation.

Nouris said the U.N. has no mandate under its 58-year peacekeeping mission in Cyprus to carry out operations aimed at halting the flow of migrants across the buffer zone. But the peacekeeping force has sole jurisdiction of the entire 180 kilometer (210-mile) no-man’s land.

“I want to discuss with them how they perceive the issue of crossings that we’re experiencing,” Nouris told the Associated Press.

The buffer zone was formed in the wake of a 1974 Turkish invasion that was triggered by a coup aimed at union with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a declaration of independence by Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus’ northern third, where most migrants arrive to the island.

Nouris said three Greek Cypriot villages are completely ensconced within that U.N. buffer zone, which he called “blind spots” where Cypriot authorities have no access and cannot control migrant crossings.

Elsewhere along the buffer zone, Cyprus government authorities are putting up barriers including barbed wire fences and high-tech surveillance systems and have formed a 300-strong patrol unit that will seek to obstruct crossings.

Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004, but the buffer zone is not considered an EU external border. Nouris said the 27-nation bloc has formally acknowledged the buffer zone as a irregular migration gateway and empowered Cypriot authorities to stop crossings using all means employed at external borders.

Nouris repeated that Cyprus has the highest per capita number of asylum-seekers in the EU and accused Turkey of channeling migrants to the island. He also said, for the first time ever, 780 Afghans arrived in Cyprus last year.

1064833011,20220926,"Liz Truss has been urged to attend a meeting of European leaders by Brussels’ representative in the UK.

European Union ambassador Joao Vale de Almeida suggested the British prime minister should attend the European Political Community (EPC) meeting in Prague in October.

He also said Ms Truss’ new administration offered an opportunity to resolve difficulties between Brussels and Westminster as he warned levels of mutual trust had dropped “too low” in recent years.

The European Political Community is Emmanuel Macron’s scheme to bring together EU nations and countries outside the bloc, potentially including the UK.

No 10 is thought to be considering whether Ms Truss or another minister will attend the gathering.

At a fringe meeting at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, the ambassador said levels of mutual trust between the UK and EU were “too low to be able to produce good results” .

Calling for more regular summits, he said: “Where is the dialogue between our leaders?

“It’s not happening and when it happens it’s not necessarily on a good basis.”

Mr Vale de Almeida said he would “fully support” the presence of Ms Truss at the EPC meeting: “This will be, if it happens, a very good signal in a direction of starting a new cycle, having a mature relationship on issues of fundamental common interest.”

The EU views the UK government’s attempts to tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol as illegal and Mr Vale de Almeida said the UK and Brussels needed to remove the stumbling blocks that prevented progress in the relationship.

He said it had been difficult to come to a “sound platform of understanding”.

The message to Ms Truss was to “seize the opportunity that the beginning of a new cycle should provide to reassess where we are and to fundamentally opt for a constructive path forward in trying to find solutions for the problems that have been identified in the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol”.

At the event, hosted by the Centre for European Reform, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said “of course” Ms Truss should attend the EPC meeting in Prague because “these are our allies, our partners”.

He said the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which will override parts of the deal signed with the EU on post-Brexit arrangements, was a “kamikaze approach to diplomacy” and warned that if it passed it would risk “a trade war with our closest allies”.

Mr Lammy also defended Labour’s approach to Brexit policy: “I think it’s completely legitimate for us in the Opposition to set out our ambition to solve problems that are emerging but to rule out joining the single market and customs union at this stage “"

1064840528,20220926,"A pro-EU party forms in the midst of ""Corbynmania""

The pro-EU Renew party emerged from out of nowhere at the height of ""Corbynmania,"" pushing for a second Brexit referendum that led to the Labour leader's demise. The intelligence backgrounds of Renew's founders were kept under wraps - until now.When Britain's little-remembered Renew Party officially launched in the heart of Westminster in February of 2018, its founders addressed a room of mostly empty chairs. The party's youthful and little-known co-founder,Founded in the midst of a surge in popular support for the Labour Party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, Renew arrived on the electoral scene at a time when the British establishment feared a genuine left-wing takeover of 10 Downing Street. While its launch initially attracted mockery from the press, with The Sunday Times describing it as a ""damp squib,""During the 2017 General Election, Corbyn won significant support on a manifesto endorsing Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. But by 2019,which set him and the party he led up for a historic defeat.His reversal was at odds with the electorate's majority will, and a great many of Labour's working class supporters. As such, in December 2019,Corbyn resigned as party chief the very next day.While Corbyn's support for a Brexit do-over during the 2019 General Election is typically viewed as a well-meaning but dangerously misguided political miscalculation,Indeed, calls for a second referendum did not originate from the British grassroots, but rather from the obscure Renew. As this investigation will reveal,The backgrounds of Renew's founders and the malign activities they conducted against Corbyn appear to validate the deposed Labour leader's insistence that the British intelligence apparatus was ""deliberately undermining"" his ambitions.In the immediate aftermath of his election as party leader in September 2015, a legion of Labour MPs, party grandees, journalists and pundits branded Corbyn ""unelectable,"" and unacceptably ""radical."" Those establishment forces were blindsided when Britons voted to approve Brexit in June of 2016, setting the stage for a tumultuous General Election the following year.The results of that election were nothing short of extraordinary. After starting the campaign polling at just 25 percent, Corbyn ultimately captured 40 percent of ballots cast, coming within just 2,227 votes of victory. Having increased Labour's share of the national vote by 10 percentage points from the previous election,The upswell in support, which represented Labour's highest swing in a general election since its historic landslide in 1945, was assisted at least in part byThough he narrowly failed to take over 10 Downing Street, Corbyn's surprisingly strong performance forced his detractors among Britain's bureaucratic and media class to view him as a serious threat. Faced with the possibility of a genuinely progressive Prime Minister, these elements launched an intense, closely coordinated effort to subvert his electoral prospects.The months following the 2017 General Election were defined by what even mainstream outlets dubbedAs Theresa May and her ministers struggled with the arduous process of negotiating the terms of London's exit from the EU with officials in Brussels, Corbyn appeared to find his footing as Britain's official opposition leader.Throughout that summer, enormous, electrified crowds welcomed Corbyn wherever he went. He was so popular, when he addressed the famed Glastonbury Festival just weeks after the General Election, The Guardian reported he drew ""the biggest crowd of the weekend.""""Corbynmania shows no signs of fading,"" the paper subsequently observed . As the establishment grappled with the unforeseen catastrophe sweeping the nation,When its leaders officially announced their arrival on Britain's political scene the next February, no grassroots followers attended the event. explained with embarrassment:So who is Chris Coghlan, and from where did the seeming political novice emerge?Coghlan became a minor public figure for running a failed ""independent""campaign for parliament in the 2017 General Election, in the key Labour target constituency of Battersea.Like Coghlan, Clarke and Torrance had each run their own ill-fated bids for parliament during that campaign, likewise in crucial Labour targets — Bermondsey and Old Southwark, and Kensington — on vehemently pro-Remain platforms.According to Coghlan and his colleagues, Renew was a Third Way-style project designed to ""challenge complacency at the heart of British politics"" and represent ""politically homeless"" voters.From its outset, the quartet's political strategy seemed misguided, if not downright bizarre. Just months before Renew's founding, the aggressively pro-EU Liberal Democrats had failed to sway the electorate in spectacular fashion, with 82.4 percent of voters supporting the UK's two main, Brexit-supporting parties, the highest total combined percentage for Labour and the Conservatives since 1970.Then again, both Coghlan and Khadhouri were curious characters to form and lead an ""anti-establishment"" movement. Branded by local media as— a reference to the billionaire banker-turned-unpopular French President — Coghlan hailed from the heart of the British security and intelligence establishment. In fact,Claiming to have resigned from Labour in response to Corbyn's vow to remain party leader irrespective of the election result, the then-36 year old opened his campaign with an appeal to the political center, slamming Labour's ""left fantasy policies,"" and pledging to fight Brexit ""with everything"" he had.A Foreign Office official who spoke to The Grayzone on the condition of anonymity saidBritish civil servants are precluded from engaging in commercial and partisan political activity, and once they leave their posts, they are required to undergo a cooling-off period before doing so as private citizens.According to the official, Coghlan's immediate entry into politics would have required permission from departmental superiors well in advance. In any event, the official considered his trajectory highly unusual, if not completely unprecedented.is made on Coghlan's LinkedIn profile. Instead, he designated himself as"" between 2015 and 2017. As sociologist David Miller, a leading critic of Britain's national security apparatus, explained to The Grayzone, this could be an indication of a more shadowy affiliation:Aside from his ""diplomatic"" work,He was mobilized to serve in Iraq under Operation Inherent Resolve , the US-led military intervention against ISIS, as recently as April 2020.Coghlan's professional links reveal further connections to Britain's covert intelligence networks. One of his primary LinkedIn endorsements was provided by James Blair , a member of the notorious British Army psychological warfare unit 77th Brigade. Another user who endorsed Coghlan's ""risk management"" skills also happens to be a 77th Brigade reservist.The LinkedIn profile of Coghlan'sIt indicates she began her political activity in Britain immediately after leaving a post asWhile there, she ""advised and helped train"" Georgian government officials in information warfare techniques, ""especially on security-related issues and countering misinformation.""Moreover, Khadhouri boasted that between October 2010 and November 2013, she ""took part in large-scale military exercises withwhile participating in ""several military training modules"" at Britain's elite Defence Academy and Permanent Joint Headquarters That training came on the heels ofDuring this time, Khadhouri was reportedly ""available to be deployed abroad, for short or long-term assignments.""Curiously, none of this background was ever mentioned in media reports exploring her role in the newly-established Renew Party. Instead, Khadhouri was invariably referred to aslet alone her hand in founding the party or time serving as its leader, anywhere on her online resume.The entry on Khadhouri's bio covering the period between October 2017 and March 2020 simply states she provided ""strategic advice, campaigning and media support to a range of pro-EU political parties and campaign groups,"" during that time, implying she was in fact an external public relations consultant during this period to a consortium of clients, of which the Renew was just one.During Renew's official launch in February 2018, its described the party as the EU Remain campaign's ""more military arm,"" an unintentionally revealing characterization given the unacknowledged records of Coghlan and Khadhouri.Following its kick-off event, Renew conducted a whirlwind nationwide tour in the UK, visiting dozens of towns and cities, addressing school children, and convening events large and small in an attempt to recruit candidates and whip up public support for a second Brexit referendum.These activities generated unprecedented amounts of press coverage, with European media bolstering comparisons between Coghlan and French President Macron. Meanwhile, Khadhouri caught the spotlight from outlets such as the BBC and Sky , and even debated the rabidly pro-Brexit Nigel Farage on his LBC show.Such instant, excited domestic and international coverage was highly abnormal for a fledgling political party in Britain, especially given none of its representatives were established politicians, let alone public figures.In all their media appearances, Renew's founders were keen to frame the party as having been founded in response to a vast groundswell of support for a second EU referendum. However, they were frequently forced to acknowledge this proposal actually had extremely limited public appeal.For instance, in a local media report on a party visit to Wales, Renew's head of strategy, James Torrance, conceded that, ""for most people Brexit is not the most important issue in their lives,"" with healthcare, housing, jobs, and social care being of infinitely greater concern.The centrist Atlantic Magazine also expressed doubts about Renew's viability in February 2018, arguing that the most pressing question in British politics was not whether Brexit would come to pass, but what form it would take. The Atlantic predicted Renew had no hope of achieving an electoral breakthrough in future general elections as long as its platform centered purely on remaining in the EU.A researcher from the elite British defense think tank, Chatham House, informed The Atlantic that any attempt to reverse the Brexit referendum's result ""would severely damage levels of trust in our political system, particularly among Leave voters."" The researcher insteadthat respected ""the democratic outcome of the vote"" while ensuring a diversity of voices were represented in Brexit negotiations with Brussels.when he initiated cross-party talks with May's government in April 2019, only to be branded a traitor by the Remain camp.The previous year, as local UK elections neared, Coghlan authored a bombastic op-ed for The Times of London claiming that he quit his Foreign Office role because he was ""demoralised by the failure of our politicians to deliver opportunity in government, fight Corbyn and a hard Brexit."" He said he resigned despite having been ""proud to protect our citizens from suicide bombers.""According to Coghlan, Renew was standing in forthcoming elections in order to ""make Corbyn listen to the overwhelming majority of Labour voters and offer a second referendum,"" and to usher in ""a tech revolution to leave no one behind.""The Renew co-founder made up for his grand vision's lack of detail with swagger, boasting that he and his allies ""already have enough parliamentary candidates to stand everywhere in the country next general election [sic].""Despite Coghlan's confident public pronouncements, Renew stood just 16 candidates in the local elections.Coghlan promptly joinedan organization that ostensibly provides financial and advisory assistance to charities. The group operates out of London's historic Two Temple Place, the same building that houses the secret headquarters of the notorious Whitehall and NATO-sponsored think tank known as the Institute for Statecraft.At that time, the Institute for Statecraft served asa covert black propaganda outfit disguised as a media research project that was directed by military intelligence professionals. The Institute became embroiled ina flagrant breach of state funding rules.Those files reveal that at precisely the same time of Renew's official launch, the Institute for Statecraft invited Glen O'Hara, Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at Oxford Brookes University, to deliver a detailed presentation at Two Temple Place entitledBelow is a slide from that presentation; the full document can be viewed here O'Hara's presence at the Institute and the organization's preoccupation with Corbyn is notable given the group's clandestine role in the creation of the 77th Brigade, the aforementioned Army propaganda unit in which some of Coghlan's most ardent professional allies proudly served.In other leaked documents, the Initiative boasted of its effort to ""help the [Armed] Forces become more competent to fight modern war with all kinds of weapons."" According to its own records, Integrity Initiative's assistance to the British army included aiding ""the creation of special Army reserve units (e.g. 77th Brigade and Specialist Group Military Intelligence) with which we now have a close, informal relationship [emphasis added].""The Integrity Initiative went on to explain these information warfare units recruited ""people whom the Army could never afford to hire, but who donate their time and expertise as patriots."" Several academics from Oxford Brookes University were enlisted to assist Specialist Group Military Intelligence, suggesting O'Hara's presentation represented one example of how the British Army was taught to ""fight modern war with all kinds of weapons."" leaked presentation given to members of the Army's 72 Intelligence Corps in 2016 dedicated an entire section to dissecting the Labour leader's ""views,"" including his opposition to NATO and the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.An accompanying slide (below) asserted that Corbyn's rise would lead to ""less focus on the military,"" noting he ""opposes military involvements and defence spending.""The only other topics explored in the leaked presentation were the war in Syria and EU refugee crisis. Evidently,This perspective is hardly insignificant. An official description of the 72 Intelligence Corps says itAs such, 72 Intelligence Corps is charged with usingThey are also responsible for safeguarding Army and Ministry of Defence ""assets"" from ""traditional and non-traditional threats.""Coghlan's background and connections suggest he may have been privy to these briefings. Which in turn raises an even more obvious question:Undeterred by their woeful 2018 election showing and Coghlan's departure from the party, Renew's remaining adherents continued their nationwide political crusade for several months. Come February 2019 though, when disaffected Conservative and Labour MPs founded the pro-EU Change UK party in February 2019, Renew stood down its candidates in the impending European election. In response,Despite Renew's effort to level the pro-Remain playing field, in the eventwith six of its members defecting yet again.The outcome was inevitable. The month that Change UK launched, academic Richard Johnson published detailed analysis which determined that winning over ""Leave-voting Conservative marginals"" would be fundamental to a Labour victory in the 2019 general election.Of the 64 seats the party needed to win in order to secure a parliamentary majority, 45 were in England and Wales, all held by Conservatives, of which 78% voted in favor of Brexit.Johnson cautioned:Considering the lack of popular support for its central platform, the clear motivation behind Renew's launch was to lend bogus grassroots legitimacy to the call for a second referendum by way of a new political party.

1064848051,20220926,"According to information released by a new website that has since been deleted, Oscar Pierre, cofounder and CEO of Spanish delivery company Glovo, is launching a new VC fund, and seeking an investor to join the team. The Fund known as Yellow Fund will invest in startups from the conception stage to Series A. Pierre spoke about the new venture at an event in Barcelona and said it would be a €50m fund, where he would personally invest €10-15m, according to Sifted.

Pierre will be donating at least 51% of his assets to “the Yellow Foundation”, which will be kick start the fund as part of its broader mission to “give back to society and the planet through empowering tech entrepreneurship”. The rest of the capital will net from “other successful founders who have successfully built scalable companies”.

The site added that the fund will be sector centered, focusing on emerging companies in Spain and southern Europe but will invest opportunistically in other regions, especially where Glovo already exists and has a “general lack of VC capital”

The move comes at a challenging time for Glovo after being acquired by Hero, a German multinational Delivery at the beginning of the year. Glovo had been found on the wrong side of the European Union for possible breaches of antitrust laws. There is still ongoing investigation looking into the company operations suspected to have been in a “cartel” with other delivery companies.

The company has also been fined €79m for breaching a labor law that requires food delivery platforms to employ their riders rather than treat them as freelancers as announced by Spain’s labor minister. The labor ministry said in a statement that Glovo has refused to give employment contracts to 10,600 riders in Barcelona and Valencia.

In response to the allegations Glovo told Sifted that the “inspections occurred prior to the introduction of Spain’s Riders’ Law” and that Glovo intends to “challenge the proposals” and is “fully committed to complying with Spanish labor regulations and the new Riders’ Law.”"
1064848054,20220926,"Liz Truss has been urged to attend a meeting of European leaders by Brussels’ representative in the UK.

European Union ambassador Joao Vale de Almeida suggested the British prime minister should attend the European Political Community (EPC) meeting in Prague in October.

He also said Ms Truss’ new administration offered an opportunity to resolve difficulties between Brussels and Westminster as he warned levels of mutual trust had dropped “too low” in recent years.

The European Political Community is Emmanuel Macron’s scheme to bring together EU nations and countries outside the bloc, potentially including the UK.

No 10 is thought to be considering whether Ms Truss or another minister will attend the gathering.

At a fringe meeting at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, the ambassador said levels of mutual trust between the UK and EU were “too low to be able to produce good results” .

Calling for more regular summits, he said: “Where is the dialogue between our leaders?

“It’s not happening and when it happens it’s not necessarily on a good basis.”

Mr Vale de Almeida said he would “fully support” the presence of Ms Truss at the EPC meeting: “This will be, if it happens, a very good signal in a direction of starting a new cycle, having a mature relationship on issues of fundamental common interest.”

The EU views the UK government’s attempts to tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol as illegal and Mr Vale de Almeida said the UK and Brussels needed to remove the stumbling blocks that prevented progress in the relationship.

He said it had been difficult to come to a “sound platform of understanding”.

The message to Ms Truss was to “seize the opportunity that the beginning of a new cycle should provide to reassess where we are and to fundamentally opt for a constructive path forward in trying to find solutions for the problems that have been identified in the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol”.

At the event, hosted by the Centre for European Reform, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said “of course” Ms Truss should attend the EPC meeting in Prague because “these are our allies, our partners”.

He said the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which will override parts of the deal signed with the EU on post-Brexit arrangements, was a “kamikaze approach to diplomacy” and warned that if it passed it would risk “a trade war with our closest allies”.

Mr Lammy also defended Labour’s approach to Brexit policy: “I think it’s completely legitimate for us in the Opposition to set out our ambition to solve problems that are emerging but to rule out joining the single market and customs union at this stage “"

1064850016,20220926,"PARIS: Iranians defied a warning from their country's judiciary and took to the streets for a 10th straight night on Sunday to protest the death of Mahsa Amini while in the morality police's custody.

Echoing an earlier warning by Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei on Sunday ""emphasized the need for decisive action without leniency"" against the core instigators of the ""riots,"" the judiciary's Mizan Online website said.

At least 41 people have been killed since the unrest began. Most were protesters, but some were members of the Islamic republic's security forces, according to an official toll. Other sources say the real figure is higher.

The West Asian country's largest protests in almost three years have seen security forces fire live rounds and bird shot, rights groups charge, while protesters have hurled rocks, torched police cars and set ablaze state buildings.

Oslo-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) said on Sunday night the death toll was at least 57, but noted that ongoing internet blackouts made it increasingly difficult to confirm fatalities in a context where the women-led protests have spread to scores of cities.

Hundreds of demonstrators, pro-reform activists and journalists have been arrested during the mostly nighttime demonstrations since unrest first broke out after Amini's death was announced on September 16.

The 22-year-old, whose Kurdish first name was Jhina, was detained three days before that for allegedly breaching rules mandating tightly fitted headscarves and which ban, among other things, ripped jeans and brightly colored clothes.

Images circulated by IHR showed protesters on the streets of the capital Tehran, shouting ""death to the dictator,"" purportedly after nightfall on Sunday.

Witnesses told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that protests were continuing in several locations. Video footage showed demonstrations in the cities of Tabriz and Shiraz, among other places, with women removing their headscarves and protesters shouting against the authorities.

Among the protesters were women who burnt their headscarves and hijabs and cut off their hair. Some danced near large bonfires to the applause of crowds that have chanted ""zan, zendegi, azadi"" or ""woman, life, freedom.""

Video of demonstrations on Saturday, verified by AFP, showed students ripping down a picture of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei outside a university in the northern province of Mazandaran.

Web monitor NetBlocks noted ""rolling blackouts"" and ""widespread internet platform restrictions"" on Sunday, with WhatsApp, Instagram and Skype already blocked.

This followed older bans on Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and Telegram.

Protests abroad in solidarity with Iranian women have been held in Athens, Berlin, Brussels, Istanbul, Madrid, New York and other cities.

In Paris and London on Sunday, police clashed with demonstrators trying to reach Iran's embassies. French officers fired tear gas. In London, 12 people were arrested and five officers were seriously hurt.

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell deplored the Iranian security forces' response to the unrest as ""disproportionate... unjustifiable and unacceptable.""

Iran, which has been hit with tough economic sanctions over its nuclear program, has blamed ""foreign plots"" for the unrest.

Its Foreign Ministry said on Sunday it had summoned the United Kingdom's ambassador over what it described as an ""invitation to riots"" by Farsi-speaking media based in London.

The ministry also called in Norway's envoy over ""unconstructive comments"" made by the North European country's parliamentary speaker.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossein Amir-Abdollahian criticized ""the US interventionist approach in the affairs of Iran... including its provocative actions in supporting the rioters.""

Iran has also organized large rallies in defense of the hijab and conservative values.

At the main pro-government event in central Tehran's Enghelab (Revolution) Square on Sunday, demonstrators voiced support for mandatory hijab laws.

""Martyrs died so that this hijab will be on our head,"" said demonstrator Nafiseh, 28, adding that she opposed making the wearing of the head covering voluntary.

Another demonstrator, 21-year-old student Atyieh, called for ""strong action against the people who are leading"" the protests.

The main reformist group inside Iran, the Union of Islamic Iran People's Party, however, has called for the repeal of the mandatory dress code.

IHR reported that an umbrella of Iranian teachers' unions were calling on teachers and students to boycott classes on Monday and Wednesday in support of the protests.

Iranian authorities are yet to state the cause of death of Amini, who activists say died as a result of a blow to the head.

Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi has said Amini was not beaten and that ""we must wait for the final opinion of the medical examiner."""

1064854701,20220926,"Preliminary $1.4B Deal to Sell Stake in DSME as KDB Begins Auction

A preliminary deal has been struck for the Korea Development Bank to sell two-thirds of its investment in Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) in a transaction that would recapitalize the financially troubled shipyard with new private investors and management. KDB, which had previously said it was making it a priority to sell Korea’s third largest shipbuilder to private investors, has selected a technique typically used in bankruptcies announcing an initial accepted bid and tomorrow will commence a month-long bidding process for a 49.3 percent stake in DSME.

The shipyard and KDB announced that Hanwha Group, one of Korea’s largest conglomerates operating in aerospace, chemicals, energy, and financial services, has been selected and made a tentative agreement to pay $1.4 billion for the stake in DSME. It is what is known as a “stalking horse” bid where one company is selected to establish a base price for the investment. Hanwha had previously in 2008 sought to acquire the shipyard group but was unable to agree on a price. The proposed acquisition is part of the group’s efforts to expand its role as a defense contractor.

KDB will now open a bidding process in which other companies can propose the terms of alternate deals for DSME. If other bidders fail to offer better terms, Hanwha’s conditional investment will proceed. The bank, which currently holds a 55.7 percent stake in DSME as well as options, would reduce its stake to 28.2 percent and Hanwha will take managerial control of the shipyard. Hanwha reports that it expects to close the acquisition in the first half of 2023.

The shipyard reported a financial loss of nearly $1.2 billion in 2021 after strong profitability the year before. The losses have continued to mount with DSME reporting a loss of more than $466 million in the first half of 2022. The shipyard also suffered a crippling strike in July that further deteriorated its financial position.

KDB, which has been the majority shareholder in the shipyard for more than 20 years, said earlier this year that the company needed a private investor to focus on the long-term and enhance its financial position. In announcing the decision to proceed with the offering, the bank said that this would provide for DSME’s current shortage of funds and secure capital for future growth.

DSME has been able to build a strong order backlog during the resurgence in shipbuilding. In 2022, they received orders for 36 ships and one offshore platform valued in total at $8.6 billion. DSME has already reached 97 percent of its order target for the year.

The state-run financial institution and other creditors have reportedly provided nearly $3 billion in support to the shipyard since 2015. KDB recently questioned continuing to provide government assistance directly to the shipyard saying that it believed the company needed to be placed into private ownership.

Previous efforts to sell the shipyard included an agreement to merge DSME with Hyundai. The European Union objected to the merger saying it would greatly reduce competition for new LNG carrier construction."
1064854703,20220926,"Drilling should pick up steam this year, gaining more than 18%, as nearly all regions will see activity increase. Development should thrive, as the world looks for additional sources of crude oil and natural gas.

The vast majority of countries outside the United States should see an increase in the number of new wells drilled this year. By the same token, some analysts see global oil and gas exploration shrinking this year, as companies continue to struggle with the Covid-19 pandemic and international energy crises, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

However, some industry professionals, like Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch, think the demand for reliable energy will accelerate the global oil exploration and production industry, Reuters reported. “The need for reliable energy supply and reinvestment in our industry remains very compelling, and will ultimately extend the growth cycle, both in terms of duration and magnitude,” Le Peuch said at the JP Morgan Energy Conference in New York, according to the Reuters report.

Indeed, Halliburton Chairman, President and CEO Jeff Miller shares Le Peuch’s enthusiasm. “I think the fundamentals today really support a multi-year energy up cycle,” Miller told World Oil. “I think we’re at a point in time, where the industry has suffered eight years of underinvestment, and that can only be overcome with some period of time of overinvestment, which I think is longer rather than shorter.” (For more of World Oil’s exclusive interview with Mr. Miller, please turn to page 48.)

Drilling outside the U.S. during 2021 was barely higher than the 2020 level, gaining just 0.6%. However, World Oil projects the number of wells drilled outside the U.S. in 2022 will increase 12.4% during 2022, as the upstream industry continues to recover. Every region will experience higher drilling levels this year, save for Western Europe, and even that area will be down just 1.8%.

On the production front, worldwide output of crude and condensate staged a small recovery last year. After dropping to 76.244 MMbopd during 2020, global production gained 1.5% last year, to average 77.412 bopd. Improvement was noted in five of the eight regions that World Oil tracks.

Given the reduced drilling levels experienced over much of the globe, it’s no surprise that worldwide crude and condensate reserves dropped nearly 1% to 1.628 trillion bbl, with six of eight regions sustaining declines. Meanwhile, natural gas reserves held up better, staying nearly even at 7,240 Tcf. Please read forward for discussions of activity in the eight global regions.

Outside the U.S., North American drilling is projected to increase 31.4% in 2022. Canadian growth continues strong, and Mexico is slowly gathering speed, despite production difficulties. Regional production averaged 17.443 bopd, up1.4%. Oil and gas reserves both declined.

Canada is poised to increase oil production by 900,000 bpd, according to Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, and Canadian gas is already moving ahead, with a 16-year production high of 17.7 Bcf during July 2022. However, Canada’s strengthening production faces bottlenecks, as existing pipelines to the U.S. limit additional exports to 300,000 bopd. The Trans-Mountain Pipeline, meanwhile, isn’t projected to finish construction until 2023. Pipeline woes also extend to natural gas, with maintenance shutting down major export pipelines in mid-2022, causing price drops in the wake of surging production. When compared to prices in January (C$4.00/GJ), July prices dropped to C$3.36/GJ.

In a rare move, Canadian President Justin Trudeau’s administration approved the environmental permit for a potential $12 billion field development project in the Bay Du Nord area, offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, Fig. 1. With estimated, initial recoverable reserves of 300 MMboe, this project is set to be Canada’s first new major undertaking since 2018. World Oil projects drilling activity to increase 31.7% this year in Canada. For more on the Canadian upstream outlook, please turn to page 39.

Mexico continues to push a national-centric plan for its oil and gas sector, ranging from making the country an LNG export hub to nationalizing production for greater domestic supply. However, this push is costly: increasing favor toward state companies versus private operators—with little priority for ESG goals—threatens to invoke the wrath of both U.S. tariffs and global climate proponents.

Mexico’s lofty goals also have to contend with rising gas prices and declining production from Pemex. In May, private operators surpassed 100,000 bopd, while Pemex’s output dropped 6% from last year, to 1.52 MMbopd. Wintershall announced two new discoveries in the Sureste basin, with a prospective find of 48 MMboe, but cooperation between Pemex and private operators is dampened by the ongoing Zama field dispute. World Oil projects drilling will increase 21.9% this year.

Brazil, Guyana and Suriname are surging ahead in production, with continued exploration promising further growth in the years ahead. Brazil already has awarded 59 exploration blocks, both onshore and offshore. This is the largest number of awarded blocks this year, worldwide. Elsewhere in the region, various countries are struggling to overcome the constraints of limited and failing infrastructure. This, added to conflicted political agendas, suggests a continuation of the downward trend from earlier this year. Compared with 2021’s impressive show of drilling growth, South America is projected to increase drilling a “mere” 13.8% in 2022. Regional oil production was up 0.7% in 2021, while reserves were down 1.0%. Gas reserves posted an encouraging 4.9% gain.

Brazil. In the wake of early 2022’s favorable legislation, production in Brazil is surging ahead. Petrobras projects 2.6 MMboed for 2022, and there was a new discovery in the Campos basin during April. Petrobras’s FPSO count is also rising, with 14 projected to be online by 2026—with five scheduled to go onstream in 2023 alone.

Independent production is also increasing, following Petrobras’s shift to pre-salt formations, away from previous assets. 3R boasted a collective 2,600 bopd in production from two such assets, and Petroreconcavo may do the same. Drilling is expected to increase 15.1% this year.

Colombia. With the recent change in administrations, Colombia’s oil and gas sector may face a shaky future. President Gustavo Petro’s halt on new exploration permits casts a cloud over NOC Ecopetrol’s goal to boost production from the 2022 target of 700,000 boed to 800,000 boed or higher by 2030. However, Colombia’s weakening energy self-sufficiency may already be softening President Petro’s stance against the industry, with his concession to respect existing contracts—even in the instance of fracing. Meanwhile, a major offshore gas discovery in July could boost Colombia’s remaining gas reserves. World Oil projects drilling will increase 6.5% this year.

Venezuela. U.S. sanctions may show signs of easing, with legislation in May improving negotiating flexibility with Venezuela, while companies await a decision later this year on allowing production to resume. Meanwhile, Venezuelan production struggled to benefit from high oil prices, with power outages, a pipeline explosion, and shutdowns all slowing production. Despite a recent, 20-year cooperation deal with Iran, Venezuela’s production for 2022 is estimated at 700,000 bopd, compared to a former high of 3.0 MMbopd. In July, the country resumed its first export shipments to Europe in two years, but failing infrastructure threatens to suspend these shipments indefinitely. Drilling is expected to increase 5.6% this year.

Argentina. Despite the estimated 27 Bboe and 802 Tcfg of reserves to be found in the Vaca Muerta play, Argentina is still lacking the infrastructure to meet domestic demand. A new pipeline that would increase output 25% has been announced, and World Oil predicts drilling to increase 18% this year. However, the looming winter season is likely to see Argentina become a gas importer, competing with the UK and Asia for supplies, in 2022 and 2023.

Guyana and Suriname. While Guyana and Suriname remain open to outside development, Guyana is considering forming a state-owned oil company to net greater profits. Following three recent offshore discoveries in Guyana and two in Suriname, the region is projected to produce 800,000 bopd by 2025, with drilling to increase 71.4% in Guyana, alone, this year. Gas is booming similarly, with an offshore LNG plant promising production of 4 MMmt/yr from Guyana and Suriname’s estimated 35 Tcf of gas reserves.

Focus may finally be shifting away from renewables and back to oil and gas, following Western Europe cutting ties with Russian oil. Norway is investing in major exploration, with 54 new licenses as of last year’s licensing round and major exploration drilling underway for 2022. Elsewhere, UK domestic production is gaining traction compared to last year, despite conflicting signals from government policy. Overall drilling is projected to decrease 1.8%, due paradoxically, and solely, to a reduction in Norwegian activity.

Norway. In the wake of the Ukraine-Russia war, Norway continues to take the initiative in filling demand. Exploration drilling is forging ahead, with 17 wells having been drilled as of July and 35 to 40 total exploration wells estimated by the end of 2022, although World Oil projects drilling overall to decrease 15.9% this year. Exploration is likely spurred by multiple new discoveries made this year, totaling approximately 439 MMbbl of oil and 25 to 80 MMboe of gas so far. Oil and gas production in the first half of 2022 totaled 300 MMbbl of oil and 60.83 Bcfg, respectively. This represents a 3.6% drop from predicted oil production and an 8% increase for gas. However, Norway’s status as a major gas exporter, plus the government’s clashing desire to reduce emissions 55% by 2030, does not promise smooth sailing altogether.

United Kingdom. The UK aims to invest £20 billion to £25 billion into its energy system, following the cutting of ties with Russia and the threat of declining North Sea output. A refocusing on oil and gas, solidified by the Jackdaw field project approval in June, was shaken by July’s surcharge bill, which levied a tax jump from 40% to 65% on oil and gas producers. However, domestic production jumped 26% from last year’s level, and World Oil projects drilling to increase 29.2%, with at least 12 exploration wells planned. Cygnus field is already on track to add over 8 Bcfg to its yearly output of 81 Bcfg.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February had a profound impact on the global energy market, as the U.S., UK, and other countries almost immediately stopped importing Russian crude, natural gas and related products. Sanctions followed soon after. Already, high commodity prices surged, leading to record-breaking gasoline prices in the United States. Regional drilling will be up 7.9%, to 10,675 wells, Fig. 4. Production last year was up 1.8%, at 13.014 bopd. Oil reserves were up 0.2%, while gas reserves slipped 0.2%.

Russia. While numerous countries have halted importing Russian energy products, the International Energy Agency found that in August, Russian oil production had fallen by less than 3% since the invasion of Ukraine. The swathe of Western energy sanctions was having only a “limited effect,” said IEA. Exploration in Russia continues, and in July, Rosneft claimed to have made an 82-MMt oil discovery in the Pechora Sea. World Oil predicts that the number of new wells drilled in the Russian Federation will increase 8% this year.

Russia continues to find ways to sell and deliver its oil despite the sanctions. Asia has continued buying the cheap Russian oil that Europe doesn’t want. In August, Bloomberg reported that a cargo of about 700,000 bbl of Russian oil was delivered to Egypt’s El Hamra oil terminal, a relatively “tiny” port on its Mediterranean coast, early on July 24. Hours later, another vessel collected a consignment from the port —which may have included some or all of the Russian barrels—according to vessel-tracking data monitored by Bloomberg.

But the IEA expects production to slow down significantly next year. The European Union’s ban on seaborne imports of Russian petroleum will lead to an 18% drop in the country’s fuel output by the end of 2023, according to an IEA report.

Other FSU countries. Kazakhstan is in the middle of preparing a major oil and gas lease tender. The country plans to reallocate or sell 107 onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration blocks, hoping to attract new operators for discovered fields and prospective new discoveries, according to a government lease auction notice. Roughly two dozen blocks will be sold or reallocated only to state-owned oil and gas companies, according to the Kazakhstan government. The 107 blocks are located both onshore and offshore, the latter being in the shallow waters of the Caspian Sea.

Meanwhile, Azerbaijan said it is increasing natural gas exports to Europe this year by 30%, as the EU looks for alternate sources to lessen dependence on Russian energy after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Azerbaijani Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov said that over the first eight months of 2022, Baku has supplied 7.3 Bcm of natural gas to Europe. Expectations are that the total volume supplied to Europe in 2022 will be 12 Bcm of gas.

Drilling in the former Soviet republics outside Russia is predicted to rise 7.7%. The area’s oil production was up slightly, while oil reserves increased 1.1%. Gas reserves slipped 0.3%.

Nigeria, traditionally the continent’s largest oil producer, is seeing political changes that could lead to more oil production, reflected in our prediction that its number of wells is expected to increase 36.5% this year. Lately, the country’s output has been decreasing, falling to 1.43 MMbopd in the three months through June, Bloomberg reported. All major African countries, excepting Libya, should see an increase in the number of wells this year. Overall, the region’s new wells drilled is forecast to increase 19.1%, to 862. Regional oil output rose 6% to 6.876 MMbpd. Oil reserves were marginally lower, while gas reserves were up slightly.

Libya. Political turmoil led to major fluctuations in Libya’s oil production during first-half 2022, until the government, National Oil Corp. and protesters reached an agreement in July to reopen oil fields and export terminals. The clash had led the country’s oil production to decrease by more than half in a matter of months, but it was back up to more than 1.0 MMbpd by late July. World Oil predicts that Libya’s number of new wells will decline 45% this year, compared to the 2021 level.

Angola. An offshore licensing round last year is helping Angola challenge Nigeria’s oil production level. The country’s output reached 1.16 MMbopd in May, according to OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report, Fig. 5. World Oil predicts the number of new wells drilled in Angola this year will increase 38.2%. TotalEnergies announced in July that it would develop Begonia, the first development of Block 17/06, 150 km (93 mi) offshore Angola. This will consist of five wells tied back to the Pazflor FPSO and add 30,000 bopd to the vessel’s production after commissioning which is expected in late 2024.

Nigeria. Nigerian oil production has declined steadily in recent years because of consistent theft from onshore oil pipelines, but the country’s sweeping Petroleum Industry Act gives producers hope that they will soon boost output. State-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) recently became NNPC Limited, a commercial venture, as mandated by the Petroleum Industry Act. NJ Ayuk, executive chairman of the African Energy Chamber, believes this will give the company an opportunity to focus on productivity and profits without the red tape and inefficiencies that came with operating as a government entity.

ExxonMobil was one of the first operators to get permits under the country’s new oil and gas law, and it renewed two deepwater leases, OMLs 133 (Erha) and 138 (Usan), for a 20-year period. Three other licenses were extended at the same time, with interests held by Chevron, Equinor, TotalEnergies, Shell and CNOOC Ltd. In late July, TotalEnergies announced that it and NNPC Limited had started production from Ikike field, about 20 km (12 miles) offshore Nigeria. The companies expect peak production of 50,000 boed by the end of the year.

Egypt is predicted to have the largest number of new wells drilled in Africa during 2022, which would reflect a 23.2% increase compared to 2021. In January, Tarek El Molla, the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, signed agreements with Canada’s Transglobe and Pharos Energy to explore and develop several regions in the eastern and western deserts. The $506 million in investments include a signature grant of $67 million to drill 12 wells, the Ministry of Petroleum said. Also in January, Italy’s Eni was awarded five new exploration licenses offshore Egypt.

Saudi Aramco surpassed Apple Inc. as the world’s most valuable company in May, showing how the region’s oil production became extremely important during an energy-short first half of the year. While a decline was predicted in 2021, due to a focus on renewable and alternative forms of energy, multiple circumstances this year showed the importance of reliable oil and natural gas supplies. Accordingly, World Oil predicts that the number of new wells drilled in the Middle East will increase 5.0% this year. Regional oil production was up 1.7% in 2021, and both oil and gas reserves were up marginally.

Saudi Arabia. Saudi Aramco posted record profits in August, which is attributed to high crude prices and high production rates. Net incomes rose to $48.4 billion in the second quarter, up from $25.5 billion in second-quarter 2021. In May, Saudi Arabia was reported to be earning $1 billion from oil exports every day. March oil exports reached $30 billion, a six-year high.

U.S. President Joe Biden visited the Kingdom during the summer to request that the country produce more oil, but many were skeptical that OPEC+ would agree. In early August, OPEC+ announced it would increase production 100,000 bpd, which amounts to one of the smallest oil production increases in its history. More recently, OPEC+ agreed to make a token oil supply cut for October to help stabilize global markets, reducing production by 100,000 bpd. Saudi Arabia recently told OPEC that its oil output hit 11 MMbpd in August. World Oil predicts the number of new wells drilled this year will increase 15.3%.

Iraq should have a significant boost in the number of new wells drilled this year, as World Oil forecasts a 29.5% increase. In April, Iraq’s Oil Ministry announced that it had begun drilling 20 oil wells in Nasiriyah oil field in southern Dhi Qar province. From January to February, Iraq’s oil exports rose from 3.2 MMbpd to 3.314 MMbpd, said the oil ministry. In July, an executive of Basra Oil Co. said the country could increase its production by 200,000 bopd this year.

UAE-Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) has held steady its oil production while continuing to invest in new equipment and projects, which should result in a 6.3% increase in new wells drilled, Fig. 6. In July, ADNOC Drilling secured $2 billion worth of contracts from ADNOC for its Ghasha offshore mega gas project, which ADNOC says is the world’s largest sour gas development. Production from the concession is expected to start around 2025, ramping up to produce more than 1.5 Bcfd before the end of the decade.

In May, ADNOC said it discovered 650 MMbbl of onshore crude reserves in Abu Dhabi, within a new formation at Bu Hasa field. Bu Hasa is Abu Dhabi’s biggest onshore field, with a production capacity of 650,000 bopd, and is operated by Adnoc Onshore. In August, ADNOC announced a $1.17 billion contract to hire 13 self-propelled jackup barges, to drive offshore operational efficiencies and support expansion of its crude oil production capacity to 5.0 MMbpd by 2030.

Oman continues to represent the largest proportion of drilling in the Middle East, and that number should increase 6.9% this year. The country’s government has reported steps that it is taking to boost production, along with its success in consistently increasing output this year.

In March, the government said it is planning to award three oil and gas blocks this year to increase upstream work, and that it is in negotiations with Shell and TotalEnergies to sign a commercial agreement that will see the development of Block 11.

The government’s plans to boost E&P activity seemed to be successful, as shortly after, Searcher entered into a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Energy and Minerals of Oman to acquire several new seismic surveys and reprocess legacy seismic data, both offshore and onshore Oman. Around the same time, Sweden’s Maha Energy said it was preparing to drill the first of six wells targeting a promising heavy oil field named ‘Mafraq’ in its Block 70 license in central Oman. This summer, Oman boosted its oil production 12.9%, compared to last year, increased its oil reserves to 4.9 Bbbl, and saw new oil discoveries that could raise its production by 50,000 to 100,000 bopd in the coming two to three years.

Iran’s oil producing capability has been in focus much more than previous years, due to energy shortages. However, there has yet to be an official revival of the 2015 nuclear deal with the U.S., which eased sanctions in exchange for Iran dismantling its nuclear stockpile. If an agreement materialized, Iran could ramp up sales within months, raising supply by hundreds of thousands of barrels per day before the end of the year, predicted the International Energy Agency. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency recently said that there is a large “information gap” regarding the country, leading European countries’ hopes to dwindle that a deal could be struck in the near future.

The Far East region should see a 10.7% increase in new wells drilled this year, to 18,523. That number is influenced by some significant increases in certain countries, such as Thailand, which World Oil predicts will boost drilling 20%. Regional oil production was off less than 1% last year, as were oil reserves, but gas reserves posted a small gain.

China. China continues to have the region’s largest proportion of wells by far, and the number of new wells drilled this year should increase by about 10.5%, aligning with the region overall.

China National Offshore Oil Corporation announced that its oil and gas production increased 8.5% to 573 MMboe. The corporation plans to invest $14 billion to $15.8 billion, to reach a production target of up to 610 MMboe in 2022, then increase up to 650 MMboe in 2023. About 65% of that production should be achieved in China, CNOOC said.

PetroChina said that it is exploring shale oil in four horizontal wells in Yingxiongling, in Qinghai oil field, part of the Qaidam basin in the western province of Qinghai, where oil exploration began in the 1950s, and aims to build a pilot zone to pump about 20,000 bpd by 2025.

CNOOC successfully tapped oil and gas from the country’s first offshore shale well in July. While this discovery came from the Weiye-1 well, which tested a daily production of 126 bbl of crude oil, CNOOC estimates that the shale oil resources in the entire Beibuwan basin are equivalent to 8.8 Bbbl.

Sinopec, China’s state-run petrochemical group that also participates in E&P, said it discovered an oil field in the Tarim basin containing 1.7 billion tons of oil reserves. This is part of a 117-well exploration program in Shunbei oil and gas field. According to the Global Times and the director of China’s Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, the new discovery could supply the country’s oil demand for two years.

India. Oil & Natural Gas Corp.’s profits soared to 152.1 billion rupees ($1.9 billion) in the quarter ended June from 43.35 billion rupees in the same period a year ago, according to an exchange filing, Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg credited Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and an increase in local gas prices for the unexpected profit surge. The country imposed a $40/bbl tax on domestic oil production from July 1 to take away windfall gains being reaped by producers, which was later reduced after prices softened. World Oil predicts the number of wells drilled in India will increase 3.6% this year.

Malaysia. Malaysia should see a significant increase in its drilling this year, and its “Coming Home Strategy” may be partially responsible, according to the Bangkok Post. The publication reported that PTT Exploration and Production Plc (PTTEP) is preparing to explore a new offshore oil block in Malaysia. Malaysian state firm Petronas awarded the exploration rights at Block SB412, off the northwestern coast of Sabah, to PTTEP through its subsidiary PTTEP HKO and its partner SapuraOMV, the Bangkok Post said.

“We are delighted to expand our growth in Malayzia through this new PSC. The investment follows through with our Coming Home Strategy, which earmarks investments for Southeast Asia,” said Montri Rawanchaikul, chief executive of PTTEP. The firm’s portfolio in Malaysia comprises several other exploration blocks. Sarawak Shell Berhad, a subsidiary of Shell plc, together with Petronas, decided to develop the Rosmari-Marjoram gas project. Gas production is expected to start in 2026. World Oil predicts that Malaysia’s new wells drilled will increase 38.6% this year.

Indonesia. In August 2022, China’s Jiangsu Strong Wind Offshore Shipyard (JSSW) completed construction of a floating production unit (FPU) for the development of a cluster of satellite fields offshore Indonesia Fig. 7. The FPU has since been christened “Trunojoy 01.” JSSW had been contracted to build and deliver the FPU for the Madura satellite fields, also known as the M satellite fields. These fields are operated by Husky CNOOC Madura Limited, a joint operating company between China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and Husky Energy (Cenovus Energy). Indonesian drilling should increase 10.5% this year.

For 2022, the South Pacific region expects to increase drilling 6.3%, with major discoveries in Australia, plus a gas boom, driving interest in developing production. In Papua New Guinea, meanwhile, development is well underway for projects delayed by the pandemic. Regional oil output was off about 5%, while both oil and gas reserves declined.

Australia. Two major discoveries, Santos and Sasanof, added 219 MMbbl to 492 MMbbl of oil and 7.2 Tcf to 17.8 Tcf of gas, combined, to Australia’s reserves. However, severe financial blows like July’s clean-up levy on the entire oil and gas industry suggest an uncertain tenure for the current gas production boom, Fig. 8. World Oil projects drilling will increase 7.7% this year.

Papua New Guinea continues to gradually increase drilling, with a 50% gain expected this year, albeit to just several wells. The PNG LNG project also has begun to gain speed, with TotalEnergies awarding a contract for the FEED stage of development in August. Elsewhere, development and seismic exploration are also underway. Angore field is expected to produce first gas in 2024, and development of P’nyang field’s estimated 4.36 Tcfg is set to follow the PNG LNG project’s completion."
1064854704,20220926,"Liz Truss has been urged to attend a meeting of European leaders by Brussels’ representative in the UK.

European Union ambassador Joao Vale de Almeida suggested the Prime Minister should attend the European Political Community (EPC) meeting in Prague in October.

He also said Ms Truss’ new administration offered an opportunity to resolve difficulties between Brussels and Westminster as he warned levels of mutual trust had dropped “too low” in recent years.

The European Political Community is Emmanuel Macron’s scheme to bring together EU nations and countries outside the bloc, potentially including the UK.

No 10 is thought to be considering whether Ms Truss or another minister will attend the gathering.

At a fringe meeting at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, the ambassador said levels of mutual trust between the UK and EU were “too low to be able to produce good results” .

Calling for more regular summits, he said: “Where is the dialogue between our leaders?

“It’s not happening and when it happens it’s not necessarily on a good basis.”

Mr Vale de Almeida said he would “fully support” the presence of Ms Truss at the EPC meeting: “This will be, if it happens, a very good signal in a direction of starting a new cycle, having a mature relationship on issues of fundamental common interest.”

The EU views the Government’s attempts to tear up the Northern Ireland Protocol as illegal and Mr Vale de Almeida said the UK and Brussels needed to remove the stumbling blocks that prevented progress in the relationship.

He said it had been difficult to come to a “sound platform of understanding”.

The message to Ms Truss was to “seize the opportunity that the beginning of a new cycle should provide to reassess where we are and to fundamentally opt for a constructive path forward in trying to find solutions for the problems that have been identified in the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol”.

At the event, hosted by the Centre for European Reform, shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said “of course” Ms Truss should attend the EPC meeting in Prague because “these are our allies, our partners”.

He said the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which will override parts of the deal signed with the EU on post-Brexit arrangements, was a “kamikaze approach to diplomacy” and warned that if it passed it would risk “a trade war with our closest allies”.

Mr Lammy also defended Labour’s approach to Brexit policy: “I think it’s completely legitimate for us in the Opposition to set out our ambition to solve problems that are emerging but to rule out joining the single market and customs union at this stage “"
1064856315,20220926,"In his recent national televised address to the Russian people, President Putin said, ""In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff.""

With thousands of Russian troops killed by Ukrainian forces, with recent military defeats, with the call-up of 300,000 Russian military reservists, and with Ukrainian President Zelensky boldly declaring his aim of retaking the eastern Donbas region and Russian annexed Crimea, Putin is looking and sounding like a desperate cornered man.

There are few things more dangerous than a desperate corned person with nuclear weapons!

With added danger, there are many in positions of power who don't take Putin's nuclear threat seriously. They are playing Putin's insane game of nuclear Russian roulette. They are placing a bet on the world that Putin is bluffing.

But at least one Western leader sees the dangers. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell warned that the world is at a ""dangerous moment"" with the Russian president ""pushed into a corner."" Borrell ominously added, ""When people say it is not a bluff, you have to take them seriously.""

But most importantly, what does the Gospel of Jesus Christ say about such situations?

Clearly Jesus lived and taught nonviolence. ""But to you who hear I say, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.""

And even if Putin does not use nuclear weapons, the ongoing loss of life of so many mostly young Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, together with the death and destruction suffered by countless innocent Ukrainian children, women and men clearly illustrates the pressing need for genuinely committed, open-minded, serious negotiations -- now!

Cooler heads and warmer hearts need to prevail. And to help insure that, we need to pray hard for peace, and pressure our leaders to move away from war and war preparation, and instead creatively build solidarity, justice and peace.

Please contact U.S. President Biden and urge him and NATO to stop the military drive to defeat Russia. And instead, urge him to seriously negotiate with Putin by being a nonviolent peacemaker -- creatively following the nonviolent guidance of the Gospel and Catholic social teaching. Consider reading and reflecting on St. Pope John XXIII's famous encyclical letter Pacem in Terris (""Peace on Earth"") .

With the grace of God, let us muster up the faith and courage to confront violence with nonviolence. Here are powerful words from Rev. Martin Luther King to inspire us along this journey: ""Hate is too great a burden to bear. Somehow, we must be able to stand up before our most bitter opponents and say, 'We shall match your capacity to inflict suffering by our capacity to endure suffering. We will meet your physical force with soul force. ... We will not only win our freedom for ourselves; we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process, and our victory will be a double victory.'""

1064856317,20220926,"RIGA - On September 24, in New York, during the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia, Edgars Rinkevics, met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of South Africa (RSA), Naledi Pandor, LETA learned from the ministry.

The Ministers discussed bilateral relations, relations between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa, and cooperation in international organizations.

Rinkevics expressed his hope that the planned political consultations between the Foreign Ministries in Pretoria this coming October will provide an opportunity for identifying cooperation areas of mutual interest.

“We are interested in developing business contacts in information technology, education and science, and in the logistics and transport sector, making use of advantages offered by Latvia’s ports and its airport. Signing of a convention on the prevention of double taxation, an air transport agreement, or a memorandum on economic cooperation would facilitate the unlocking of cooperation potential,” Rinkevics underlined.

The Latvian Foreign Minister called on the RSA to consider applying to the citizens of Latvia the same entry conditions as to the largest part of EU citizens. This would make it possible to stay in the RSA visa-free for up to 90 days.

The Ministers also exchanged positions concerning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Latvian Foreign Minister drew attention to the fact that in 2025, for the first time, Latvia would stand as a candidate in elections to the United Nations Security Council for the term of 2026–2027."
1064861083,20220926,"Meloni co-founded the Brothers of Italy in 2012 as a breakaway from the country’s main center-right party, People of Freedom. The Brothers was nationalist from its inception, taking its name from a line in the Italian national anthem. It uses colors and symbols associated with the post-war Italian Social Movement, a party founded by supporters of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. It has never advocated fascism, but its pedigree has nevertheless always raised concerns.

But Italy is not Hungary. It has a robustly free media and has been a Western democracy for nearly 80 years. Moreover, Meloni’s party has never embarked on a crusade against liberal democracy the way Mussolini or even Orban has. The Brothers party doesn’t want to end democracy; it wants to respect Italy’s national traditions and restore the country’s economic freedoms.

Those twin concerns mark Meloni’s rise and explain her appeal. She came to prominence when she proclaimed in 2019 that “I am a woman, I am a mother, I am Italian, I am a Christian.” This social conservatism isn’t rooted in the past; rather, it is rooted in a sense that Italy’s past is worthy of respect and can form the foundation for its future.

The economic issues are also crucial to explaining her rise. Italy is a founding member of the euro zone, but its economy has largely stagnated after adopting the euro in 2002. Since then, Italy’s economy has never grown by more than 2 percent annually, except for last year’s post-pandemic bounce. It also never recovered from the 2008 financial crash; unemployment has never dropped below 8 percent since then, and its real GDP per capita remains lower than it was in 2007.

This has produced political upheaval, of which Meloni and her party are the current beneficiaries. Italy’s 2006 election featured two traditional coalitions, center-left and center-right, which received almost all of the votes. Pro-European traditional parties anchored each coalition, with no serious populist opposition. By 2013, an anti-establishment populist party, the 5 Star Movement (M5S), received more than 25 percent. Five years later, M5S won nearly a third of the vote and 22 percent went to the Brothers and the League, which had taken a populist, anti-immigrant turn.

Doing so won’t be easy. She will be hamstrung by Italy’s massive debt, which causes it to rely on support from the European Union and European Central Bank. Her social conservatism could also be opposed by the European Parliament. France’s prime minister reacted to Meloni’s win by saying France would “be attentive” to Italy’s abortion laws to protect women’s access to the procedure. The E.U.’s recent move to withhold financial aid to Hungary — which Meloni’s party opposed — shows Brussels is not afraid to put its money where its values are.

Meloni knows she needs to move carefully. She took pains during the campaign to say Italy will be fiscally responsible under her leadership. She supports sanctions against Russia and expresses broad support for the Western alliance. No one should expect her to make waves in these areas once she takes power.

Nevertheless, Meloni cannot operate as a normal European leader. Italians wants change and, in recent years, they have moved to whichever party credibly promises to deliver. So to stay in power, she must show she can push the E.U. to give Italy more slack to execute what the nation wants.

That conflict will likely emerge on three fronts: migration, E.U. financial support and capping energy prices. Regarding the first, Italy is a front-line nation when it comes to migration from Africa and the Middle East. Meloni has previously called for a naval blockade to prevent mass immigration. Restricting immigration is popular in Italy, and she will likely be willing to stand up to the E.U. if it disapproves of her efforts to limit it.

Second, the E.U.’s financial support to Italy comes primarily from its coronavirus recovery program, NextGenerationEU. That support is substantial but comes with many strings attached. Meloni has argued for renegotiating with the E.U. to give her more flexibility in using the funds. Expect her first budget, due later this year, to lay down that challenge.

Finally, Meloni has stated that the E.U. needs to cap energy prices and that Italy will act if the E.U. does not. Such a cap could be extremely expensive, as it would require substantial government transfers to energy companies to keep them solvent. Germany is said to be looking at some form of energy price cap, which could produce room for agreement. But Meloni knows standing up to Brussels and Berlin to protect Italians’ energy bills would be extremely popular if she had to.

Many in the European establishment believe they can tame Meloni as they did her predecessors. But Italy’s first female prime minister is not likely to go along meekly. Given Italians’ strong desire for change, she is likely to be a stronger change agent than many think."
1064861084,20220926,"The Danish energy ministry said it had acted after being informed about a pressure drop in the now-defunct undersea pipeline earlier on Monday.

""The Nord Stream 2 landfall dispatcher registered a rapid gas pressure drop on Line A of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline,"" it said in a statement, adding that it was investigating the matter.

In its statement, the Danish energy ministry said: ""There are no security risks related to the leak outside of the prohibitive zone.

Nord Stream 2 had been built to deliver gas from Russia to Germany and other European nations, but the multi-billion euro project was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine in February.

However, gas had already been pumped into the pipe, and there are now concerns that large amounts of it could be released into the atmosphere.

Nord Stream 1 - a parallel gas pipeline - has been shut for several weeks, with Gazprom saying it was carrying out maintenance work to fix an earlier leak.

The European Union accuses Russia of using its gas supplies to blackmail Europe because of its war in Ukraine, but Moscow denies this.

There are growing fears families in the EU will be unable to afford the cost of heating this winter.

Europe is now attempting to wean itself off Russian energy in an effort to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war, but the transition may not come quickly enough."
1064864571,20220926,"VILNIUS - Recent decisions by the three Baltic countries, Poland and Finland not to allow in some Russians with visas have severely limited the entry of Russian citizens into the European Union, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on Monday.

""With the five borders closed or entry across the five borders radically restricted (...), the flow drops dramatically, because planes cannot take it over,"" he told reporters. ""The same is true for Russian citizens fleeing the alleged mobilization.""

According to the minister, although Russians can still fly to Europe via Istanbul, ""there is no possibility for them to arrive in large numbers"".

""Even if they all fly to Istanbul and try to fly on (to the EU), both the airlines and the airports have very limited resources,"" Landsbergis said.

""It is simply impossible to cram thousands of people into the same airport and onto the same planes that are available today,"" he added.

Commenting on possibilities for the EU to expand its sanctions against Russia, Landsbergis said that ""there has been some headway in discussions on an eighth package of sanctions"", but it is not yet clear if a deal will be reached, because some member countries are opposed to tightening restrictions.

""There are certain groups of goods, and individuals, companies and potentially banks (that could be sanctioned). I don't want to go deeper and create expectations, because we have seen (...) states use their veto to dash these expectations,"" he said.

The three Baltic countries and Poland have been restricting the entry of Russian citizens into their territories for a week now, in a regional coordinated response to Moscow's continuing war in Ukraine.

Finland announced a similar decision at the end of last week.

The EU has agreed to lift a facilitated visa regime for Russians, but the five member states are calling for even tighter visa restrictions.

The Baltic countries refused entry to around 350 Russian citizens last week, of whom 153 were not allowed into Lithuania."

1064865781,20220926,"UNITED NATIONS — Some of the West's fiercest critics made their cases in the closing hours of the U.N. General Assembly meeting of world leaders, as Syria and North Korea on Monday accused the United States and its allies of trying to impose their will on the world.

Syria's top diplomat called for a U.S.-led military coalition to get out of his country, a North Korean ambassador said his nation wouldn't yield to U.N. demands to give up its nuclear weapons program, and both condemned sanctions against their countries.

If the messages weren't exactly new, they carried the extra weight of a once-a-year chance to speak from the same famous podium as the leaders of other nations, including their adversaries. U.S. President Joe Biden addressed the assembly last week, making no direct mention of Syria but briefly complaining that North Korea ""continues to blatantly violate U.N. sanctions"" over its nuclear activities.

North Korean U.N. Ambassador Kim Song retorted Monday that Biden ""picked on us,"" and Kim shrugged off his message.

""To put it clearly, we have never recognized such resolutions of the United Nations that impose pressure"" because North Korea views them as U.S. aims given an international imprimatur, Kim said.

""We will not recognize them in the future, either,"" he added.

He said relations were potentially ""heading into a much more dangerous phase"" — potentially the shakiest since World War II — because of the ""high-handedness and arbitrariness of some countries"" that he said were trying to overwrite the international system with ""Western values.""

Syria Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad also took aim at sanctions, which the the U.S., some other countries and the European Union have imposed on his country's government, oil industry and more. He said his country has been ""economically besieged"" by powers bent on getting their way and retaining their wealth.

""The war against Syria, ultimately, was an attempt by the West to maintain control over the world,"" he said.

The civil war began in 2011 with anti-government protests demanding that President Bashar Assad's government make democratic reforms, but the situation quickly escalated into fighting that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Amid the chaos, the Islamic State militant group took over significant parts of Syria. In 2019, the group lost the last sliver of land its fighters controlled, but its sleeper cells are still active.

To Syria's frustration, hundreds of U.S. troops are stationed in the country's east to help the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to fight the militants. Mekdad said the coalition's presence contradicts international law and ""should end immediately, without conditions.""

""Fighting terrorism does not happen through an illegitimate international coalition that violates Syria's sovereignty and destroys towns and villages,"" he said, arguing that battling terrorism can't work without ""coordination"" with Assad's government.

Syria also wants compensation for $107 billion in ""direct and indirect"" losses in its oil and gas sector during the war, Mekdad said. The American forces and the SDF currently control much of the oil fields in eastern Syria.

The U.S. didn't immediately respond to the remarks from Mekdad and Kim. They spoke on the closing day of the annual ""debate"" that brings presidents, monarchs, premiers and cabinet ministers to the assembly's podium.

Russia's war in Ukraine has taken up much of the discussion this year, but the six days of speeches still formed a mosaic of global issues, national priorities, regional rivalries and don't-forgets. Monday was no exception.

Mauritanian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salem Ould Merzoug called for debt cancellation for African countries. His Canadian counterpart, Mélanie Joly, told the world's women that her country would ""speak up for your rights and dignity — no government, no politician, no judge, no one, can take that away from you.""

Bhutan's foreign minister, Tandi Dorji, said he overhauled his speech after getting a letter from a 7-year-old girl in his Himalayan homeland. She worried that her small community would be flooded by melting snow and glaciers in a warming world, he said, reading from the letter.

""I would request your excellency to kindly convey this small message to the world leaders and big and rich nations to help and save our tiny village from global warming,"" she wrote. ""I am sure if we all come together, we can not only save our tiny village but also make our Earth safe for all living beings.""

The high-profile speeches began last week with countries that sent heads of state and government. By Monday, foreign minister- and ambassador-level speakers were taking the podium, and the colossal security cordon around the United Nations headquarters had been largely dismantled.

On the final day, many speakers still spoke emphatically about how important the global organization remains in a fragmented world.

""We need more of the U.N., not less,"" Joly said.

As the last country to weigh in, Nauru took stock of a world that has been buffeted by the Ukraine war, the coronavirus pandemic and climate change, all at once. But diplomat Josie-Ann Dongobir closed with hope ""that this year allows us to be open to the transformation we seek.""
